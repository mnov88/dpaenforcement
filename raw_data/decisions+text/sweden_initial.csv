The Data Inspectorate finds that Google LLC (Google) has not taken measures so that a certain search result in complaint 2 in the Data Inspectorate's earlier supervisory decision with registration number 1013-2015 is not displayed for searches on the complainant's name using Google's search services that can be made from Sweden during the period May 25, 2018 to October 12, 2018. Google has through this processed personal data in violation of  Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation by dealing with sensitive personal data consisting of data on ethnicity, religious REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 3 (31) conviction, mental health and sexual life, without having for treatment a valid exemption from the ban on treating sensitive personal data.  Article 10 of the Data Protection Regulation by considering personal data relating to offenses consisting of data on prosecution and preliminary investigation without the treatment being allowed.  Article 17 of the Data Protection Regulation by not unnecessarily have delayed the complainant's request for removal. 2. The Data Inspectorate finds that Google has not taken any action so that a certain search result in complaint 8 in the Data Inspectorate's previous supervisory decision with registration number 1013-2015 is not displayed for searches on the complainant's name with using Google's search services that can be made from Sweden during the period May 25, 2018 to June 11, 2018. Google has dealt with this personal data in violation of  Article 10 of the Data Protection Regulation by considering personal data relating to offenses consisting of data on allegations of crime and preliminary investigation without processing been allowed.  Article 17 of the Data Protection Regulation by not unnecessarily have delayed the complainant's request for removal. 3. The Data Inspectorate finds that Google since May 25, 2018 regularly informs webmasters of websites when the company has taken deleted a URL as a result of a removal request. Google thereby processes personal data in violation of  Article 5 (1) (b) of the Data Protection Regulation in that the procedure constitutes a personal data processing that is incompatible with the original purpose for which the data were collected.  Article 6 of the Data Protection Regulation by not having a legal basis for the treatment. 4. The Data Inspectorate states that Google since 25 May 2018 in its Web forms for removal requests inform individuals about and requires them to agree that Google may inform them free flow of such data and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Ordinance) .Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 4 (31) webmasters for such URLs that are removed from the search results to as a result of individual requests. Google deals with this personal data in violation of  Article 5 (1) (a) in that the procedure is intended to persuade individuals to refrain from exercising its right to request removal. 5. The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of ch. Section 3 of the Data Protection Act and 2 Articles 58 (2) and 83 of the Data Protection Regulation require Google to pay a administrative penalty fee of SEK 75,000,000 (seventy-five million). 6. The Data Inspectorate submits pursuant to Article 58 (2) (d) i Google's Data Protection Regulation that, as far as removal requests are concerned of displaying search results when searching for individuals' names using Google search services that can be done from Sweden,  stop informing webmasters of URLs when Google has granted a request except in cases where the individual has requested the.  cease to display the text “If URLs are removed from ours search results as a result of your request, we can provide information to them webmasters for the deleted URLs ”in their web form for request for removal or provide similar information to individuals if it is not clear that webmasters are only informed about that a request has been granted if the individual has requested it. 1 Report on the supervisory matter 1.1 General In May 2015, the Swedish Data Inspectorate started with the support of the Personal Data Act (1998: 204) and the Data Protection Directive a supervisory case with a record number 1013-2015 (the former case) against Google Inc. whose legal successor is Google LLC (Google or Company). The review was about how Google handles it requests from natural persons that certain search results should not be displayed at 2 The Act (2018: 218) with supplementary provisions to the EU Data Protection Regulation. 3 Directive 95/46 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free flow of such information.Datainspektionen DI-2018-9274 5 (31) searches on their name on the company's search services (removal request). The review took place in the light of the ruling that stated that individuals are right to be granted in certain cases a request for removal and 4 data protection authorities' guidelines for interpreting the judgment (WP225- 5 guidelines) and this right (right of removal). In addition to Google's handling of removal requests in general included in The review also includes 13 complaints received by the Data Inspectorate from individuals who believed that the company had incorrectly rejected their respective request on removal. The review was terminated by decision of 2 May 2017 (the previous decision). In the decision, the Data Inspectorate presented Google with the latest take action on 2 August 2017 regarding five of the complaints (Nos. 2, 4, 5, 8) and 9) in such a way that the specified search results are not displayed during searches on the names of the complainants. The Data Inspectorate also made recommendations on how such requests should be handled. Google appealed the injunction regarding complaint no. 8. The appeal was rejected on 2 May 2018 in this part and entered into force on 24 May 2018. 7 On 25 May 2018, the Data Protection Ordinance began to be applied. Based on tips from the public that Google had not followed the decision and the judgment, the Data Inspectorate stated during an inspection on 8 June 2018 that search results from complaints 2 and 8 were still displayed. Against this background this supervisory matter was initiated. 4 Judgment of the European Court of Justice of 13 May 2014, Google Spain and Google, C-131/12. 5 Article 29 Working Party on Data Protection, “Guidelines on the Enforcement of Judgments \[Google Spain and Google\] ”of 26 November 2014 (WP 225). The working group has in and with the entry into force of the Data Protection Regulation replaced by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) (see Articles 68 and 94 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation). 6 The decision in its wording following the decision on reconsideration of 14 July 2017. References to the decision in the following refers to the decision in this wording. 7 The Administrative Court in Stockholm's judgment of 2 May 2018 in case no. 16590-17. The Data Inspectorate appealed the Administrative Court's judgment in the part in which it went The Data Inspectorate received, ie. repeal of the injunction 'in the part intended to remove search results that can be displayed when searching on the registrant's name using Google LLC's search services that can be done from countries other than Sweden ”. The Court of Appeal decided on 3 December 2018 in case no. 4635-18 not to grant leave to appeal, which was established by the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court on 11 September 2019 in case no. 6887-18.Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 6 (31) The supervision has taken place through correspondence. The review is about how Google is doing handled the complainants' requests and the Data Inspectorate's injunctions concerning complaints 2 and 8 in the previous decision. Against the background of what has emerged, the Data Inspectorate has also followed up on certain issues as well highlighted in the recommendations of the decision. This refers to how Google investigates removal requests as well as Google's routine to provide regular information webmasters for relevant URLs once a request has been granted and Google's information to individuals about this in Google's web form for request for removal. 1.2 The content of previous decisions as far as is now relevant 1.2.1 Order concerning complaints 2 and 8 In the previous decision, the Data Inspectorate stated that Google ""processes personal data in violation of section 5 a, second paragraph of the Personal Data Act on display of search results after searching for the complainant's name in Google's search services regarding the search results referred to in  Complaint 2 (Google No. 0-5877000003906)  \[…\] \[och\]  complaint 8 (Google no. 1-8544000003955), the search hit that links to one article on the website www.sydsvenskan.se. ” The Data Inspectorate instructed Google to “take action to address the above the search results are not displayed when searching on the complainant's name using Google search services that can be done from Sweden ""and stated that"" \[the\] measures must be completed by 2 August 2017. "" The Data Inspectorate stated in the reasons for the previous decision regarding complaints 2 that the public interest in having access to the information on the appellant in the current discussion thread via search in Google search services does not justifies the breaches of privacy that the treatment entails. This against given that the current discussion thread is extensive survey of the complainant and reports fairly extensively and at most private information about the complainant's ethnicity, religious beliefs, mental health, sexual preferences, offenses (information on prosecution and preliminary investigation), family and address. Google was thus ordered to cease with the treatment. The company did not appeal the decision. Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 7 (31) The Data Inspectorate stated in the reasons for the previous decision regarding complaints 8 that the Data Inspectorate limited its review to the search result that leads to an article published on Sydsvenskan's website with information about crime which the complainant is alleged to have committed (information on allegations of crime and ongoing preliminary investigation). The Data Inspectorate judged that such information may be considered particularly sensitive to privacy and instructed Google to cease the treatment. The company appealed the decision to the administrative court as in the judgment of 2 May 2018 agreed with the Data Inspectorate's assessment and confirmed 8 the decision. 1.2.2 Obligation to investigate the circumstances of a request In the previous decision, the Data Inspectorate mainly stated the following (see pp. 11–14). There are no formal requirements for a request for rectification under the Data Protection Directive or the Personal Data Act. When it comes to handling a request may, even if the provision in section 28 of the Personal Data Act is not directly applicable in this case, the preparatory work for that provision serve as guidance. According to these, it is sufficient that it appears from a request that the data subject is dissatisfied with the processing in any particular respect and wants correction to be taken. If such a request is made, it should personal data controllers urgently investigate the allegations the remarks are justified and, if so, make corrections as soon as possible. The scope of the investigation may depend on the remarks made by it registered have produced. It should in the first instance be the responsibility of the individual to state sufficient information to enable Google to process his request. Information on which search hit is meant by a request should preferably be made is identified by entering the URL of the web page being searched links to. In cases where the individual refers to the name of a website, a blog or similar and it is possible to identify the website and it information on the website in question, it should be the responsibility of Google to take action to identify the search result to which the request relates. The same goes for it individual has mistaken the top level domain in the web address for example .se i instead of .com and it appears from, among other things, the search result which search result to which the individual refers. About Google, despite investigative measures taken, considers that it is not possible to identify the search hit as the individual has requested that Google remove or if Google does not accept the individual 8 The Administrative Court in Stockholm's judgment of 2 May 2018 in case no. 16590-17, p. 12 para. 2.Datainspektionen DI-2018-9274 8 (31) facts of the case, the individual should be informed of this and given opportunity to complete their tasks. Against this background, the Data Inspectorate recommended that Google take action necessary measures to investigate a vague and incomplete request to: search results should be deleted. 1.2.3 Communication to webmasters that removal has taken place In the previous decision, the Swedish Data Inspectorate mainly stated the following (p. 19-20). When Google deletes a search result, the company sends another message the webmaster whose web page is affected if he or she has signed up Google's Webmaster Tools service. In the complaints examined occur usually only one or a few names of the web pages that the search hits links to. It should therefore be relatively easy for the webmaster to determine who has requested removal. Google must therefore assume that information about which web pages are affected by a deletion indirectly involves a personal data processing. Against this background, the Data Inspectorate recommended that Google only send information to webmasters when it is clear that such information does not infringe on the privacy of data subjects. 2 Grounds for the decision 2.1 Starting points for the assessment of follow-up complaints A search engine provider must, within the framework of its responsibilities, its qualifications and ensure that the processing of personal data in the business meets the requirements of the data protection rules, since the business can significantly affect fundamental rights regarding 9 privacy and the protection of personal data of the persons concerned. The characteristics of a search engine's business do not mean that it is excluded the prohibitions and restrictions on the processing of sensitive data and Judgment of the European Court of Justice of 13 May 2014, Google Spain and Google, C-131/12, paragraph 38 and 83. Judgment of the European Court of Justice of 13 May 2014, Google Spain and Google, C-131/12, paragraph 41.Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 9 (31) criminal information, but these apply when the search engine has received a request on removal. 11 The Data Inspectorate states that if a personal data controller has taken receive a request for removal from a registrant, but does not remove the information without undue delay or rejects the request on incorrect grounds; the further processing takes place in violation of the Data Protection Regulation. When it is the question of search engine services does this require prompt handling particularly relevant as the dissemination of personal data risks becoming very extensive and an alternative attitude would erode the individual opportunities to exercise their rights and the protection of the personal integrity. The Data Inspectorate has already in the previous decision assessed the outcome of the balance in complaints 2 and 8 and then found that the treatment took place in violation with the Personal Data Act and the Data Protection Directive. Current legislation (Data Protection Regulation) and the practices that have been added do not there is reason to make a new assessment in this regard. During previous inspections, the Data Inspectorate has found deficiencies in the handling of complaints 2 and 8. Deficiencies have existed since the Data Inspectorate's decision won legal force in each part, or when measures were to be implemented at the latest, which was before the Data Protection Ordinance came into force on 25 May 2018. The regulation entails enhanced rights for individuals and provides The Data Inspectorate significantly more powerful powers. Starting point for the Data Inspectorate's assessment regarding continued violations is taken therefore on the date of implementation of the Regulation, ie 25 May 2018. 2.2 Follow-up of complaints 2 2.2.1 What has emerged during the proceedings During a control search on 8 June 2018 of complaint 2, the Data Inspectorate found that the search result specified in the decision ”is displayed as the first search result in the search result in a search performed on October 10, 2016 ”(search result 2) was still displayed at search on the complainant's name and therefore requested that Google comment. Judgment of the European Court of Justice of 24 September 2019, G.C. and others, C-136/17, points 43-47.Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 1 0 (31) Google stated in a response on June 15, 2018 that the company regarding complaint 2 per on 18 May 2017 had fixed a specific web address (search result 1). The Data Inspectorate stated in a letter dated 9 July 2018 to Google in essentially the following. The documents in the previous case show that it search result described in the reasons for the previous decision was search result 2. The URLs in search results 1 and 2 are identical except that the latter has two extra character at the end (""p2"") which is an abbreviation for ""page two"" in one discussion thread on a forum. The URL in search result 1 identifies both the whole discussion thread and its first page. The Data Inspectorate pointed out that there may be reason to consider a request identifying one URL, which thus both identifies the entire discussion thread and constitutes its first page, not only includes search results leading to the first page but also to subsequent pages, such as search hit 2. This is especially true if individuals provide information that points in this direction, such as the complainant can be considered to have done by in addition to what is stated in the form clarifies that ""the whole thread specified"" violates the complainant's privacy (the original request). If Google nevertheless did not consider itself obliged to remedy search result 2, the Data Inspectorate reminded of the company duty of investigation and information in the event of an unclear or incomplete request. Google stated the following in its response on 30 August 2018 to the Swedish Data Inspectorate request to state whether action would be taken in relation to search results 2 and how similar situations are handled. Google took action regarding two other pages in the current thread in 2014 and another page in August 2018 in connection with the Data Inspectorate's request. Google will not take action concerning search hit 2, as the appellant did not specifically request it. One such request ""is a personal right"" which ""can only be exercised by it registered ""and Google"" therefore respects the extent to which it registrants have given their request '. According to Google, this has support in WP225- the guidelines stating that data subjects must “identify the specifics the URLs ”. The obligation to investigate or inform has not arisen. 12The previous case, file appendix 1 appendix 2 p. 2. 13WP225 guidelines, p. 14 (Data Inspectorate's translation). Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 1 1 (31) The complainant contacted the Data Inspectorate on 9 October 2018 regarding search hit 2 and then received information about the company's attitude and opportunity to make a new request in addition to the current examination of it original request, which the complainant made on 12 October 2018 (the new one) request). Google stated the following in its response on October 25, 2018 to the Swedish Data Inspectorate request to state its assessment of the new request. Google remedied application meeting 2 on 12 October 2018 due to the appellant made the new request. Google deleted the search result because the content on the web page is basically the same as on the web pages that have been taken before away and especially when the website does not contain information about the complainant has been released. 2.2.2 The Data Inspectorate's assessment The Data Inspectorate notes that the original request in complaint 2 included search hit 2. This is because the appellant in a sufficient manner identified it by entering the URL that both identifies the entire discussion thread and its first page (search result 1) in the web form, partly refer to the whole thread in its supplement. In addition, a discussion thread must be judged as a whole and can not as Google has done is solely assessed on the basis of the information provided appears on the page that a search result links to. As the Svea Court of Appeal established, this follows from the fact that for an Internet user linked to one page in a discussion thread it is obvious that it does not only include posts on that page and that it is not possible based on the posts on just one page overview the content of the discussion. 14 Because Google has not processed the request, but the search hit continued has been shown until 12 October 2018, when the complainant made a new request on removal, Google has not addressed the request without undue delay in the meaning of Article 17 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. Google has processed personal data in breach of Article 17 of the the Data Protection Regulation. 14Svea Court of Appeal judgment of 6 October 2017 in case no. FT 494-17, p. 4 with agreement in the assessment of the lower instance (p. 16 f.). Datainspektionen DI-2018-9274 1 2 (31) As stated in the previous decision is processed at the web address provided the search results lead to sensitive personal data and criminal data about the appellant within the meaning of Articles 9 and 10 of the Data Protection Regulation. During the current period, ie the 25th May to October 12, 2018, Google is responsible for the referral to the URL and in particular because the link appears in the search results as 15 presented to Internet users searching for the complainant's name. Something support for processing such data under the Data Protection Regulation not existed. Google has thus processed personal data in violation of Articles 9 and 10 of the Data Protection Regulation. Furthermore, the Data Inspectorate states that the injunction in the previous decision regarding complaint 2 included search result 2. What Google has stated about that the injunction shall be interpreted in the light of the reasons for the decision does not change it assessment. It is not clear from the wording of the decision that the injunction was limited to certain search results in complaint 2, which it did, however for example, complaints 8 and 9 (see section 1.2.1 above). It further appears from the reasons for the decision that search result 2 was the search result that was displayed when the search result was checked during the processing and thus what The Data Inspectorate assessed in the decision. Google could easily have detected this by checking the scope of the request and the search results provided was shown when the company took measures to comply with the injunction in May 2017. Because Google took action on search hit 2 only on October 12th 2018, ie after the date specified in the injunction in the previous decision, Google has failed to comply with an injunction that The Data Inspectorate announced on the basis of section 45 of the Personal Data Act and the Data Protection Directive. 2.3 Follow-up of complaints 8 2.3.1 What has emerged during the proceedings During a control search on 8 June 2018, the Data Inspectorate found that the search match from complaint no. 8 (search result 1) was still shown. The Data Inspectorate pointed this out in a letter to Google and referred to the Administrative Court Judgment of the European Court of Justice of 24 September 2019, G.C. and others, C-136/17, paragraph 46. 16See previous decision, p. 23.Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 1 3 (31) judgment of 2 May 2018 which upheld the injunction. It was further pointed out that According to the court, the verdict had been served on Google on the same day as it was announced and thus gained legal force on 24 May 2018. Google contacted the Data Inspectorate on 11 June 2018. Google then stated that the company was not notified of the judgment until 23 may 2018 and that it would therefore win entered into force on 14 June 2018 and that Google was still considering the ruling would be appealed. The Data Inspectorate then clarified that the Data Inspectorate had checked specifically with the administrative court that the task of the court provided on the day of service was not a misunderstanding, but reminded Google 17 on the possibility of obtaining judicial review of whether the judgment has become final. Google stated in a letter dated June 15, 2018 that the company on June 11, 2018 decided not to appeal the judgment and therefore that day had remedied application date 1. In support of the fact that service must have taken place on 23 May 2018 Google submits a service receipt signed and dated by the company agent. In addition, correspondence has taken place regarding a search match with identical content and leading to the same article as search hit 1 on the same site but with a different URL (search result 2). According to Google, there was that search hit not when the request to delete search hit 1 was made. Google has, however granted a request for deletion of search hit 2 on February 13, 2019 after a new request was received from the complainant on February 11, 2019. Google considered that that request could be granted without the need for a new balancing of interests done because the content of the web page was identical to the web page for search result 1. 2.3.2 The Data Inspectorate's assessment The Data Inspectorate finds that Google has not processed the request in complaint 8 in the previous decision so that search result 1 is not displayed during the period from 25 May 2018 to 11 June 2018. With regard to the Swedish Data Inspectorate had previously clarified in its decision that the request would be granted, which also had been confirmed by the administrative court in a judgment that Google according to its own information had in any case been served on May 23, 2018, Google can not be considered to have processed the request without undue delay within the meaning of Article 17 (1) (i) 17Acts Appendix 7 and 10–12.Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 1 4 (31) the Data Protection Regulation. Google has thus processed personal data in in breach of Article 17 of the Data Protection Regulation. As stated in the previous decision is processed at the web address provided the search leads to criminal information about the appellant within the meaning of Article 10 of the Data Protection Regulation. During the current period, it wants say May 25 to June 11, 2018, Google is responsible for the referral to the web page and in particular because the link appears in the search results as 18 presented to Internet users searching for the complainant's name. Something support for processing such data under the Data Protection Regulation not existed. Google has thus processed personal data in violation of Article 10 of the Data Protection Regulation. Furthermore, the Data Inspectorate finds that Google has not shown that the company has followed the injunction in the previous decision concerning complaint 8 within that time limit which was stated in the decision, which through the company's appeal may be considered to have been when the injunction became final. The Data Inspectorate states that this was on May 24, 2018, which is not changed by the circumstances and the evidence as invoked by Google. Google has thereby failed to comply an injunction issued by the Swedish Data Inspectorate on the basis of section 45 the Personal Data Act and the Data Protection Directive. Regarding search result 2, the Data Inspectorate finds that it was not covered by the original request or the Data Inspectorate's injunction because it according to Google, did not exist when the request was made. 2.4 Communication to webmasters that search results have been deleted and information about this to individuals 2.4.1 What has emerged during the proceedings If Google grants a removal request, Google has a routine to notify webmasters (that is, anyone who subscribes to Google) service ""Search Console"" formerly ""Webmaster Tools"") about which URL which has been removed and that this was done as a result of a request for removing. Judgment of the European Court of Justice of 24 September 2019, G.C. and others, C-136/17, point 46. Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 1 5 (31) Google's removal request webpage contains the text '\[o\] m URLs are removed from our search results as a result of your request we may provide information to the webmasters of the deleted URLs ”. IN connection to the text, the individual is encouraged to read the information and check a box that they approve such treatment. 19 Google has reported that 5,690 URLs have been removed upon request from Sweden during the period May 25, 2018 to February 11, 2019. The Data Inspectorate can thereby establish that information has been provided webmasters in a large number of cases. Google has further stated in essence the following. First is The Data Inspectorate is not the competent supervisory authority regarding Google's routine to send such messages. Secondly, such messages are not Processing of personal data. Third, such treatment is not included in violation of the Data Protection Regulation. This is because the messages are in compliance with the purpose limitation principle set out in Article 5.1.b, as the purpose is to facilitate the right to be forgotten. Furthermore, processing a legal basis, as Google has a legitimate interest to process the data in order to increase the impact of the right to be forgotten as well as to inform the webmaster in its capacity as concerned interested. Fourth, Google complies with the principle of proportionality obliged to balance the right to be forgotten against opinion and freedom of information. Fifth, the routine is an appropriate and proportionate action and industry practice. 2.4.2 The Data Inspectorate's assessment 2.4.2.1 The Data Inspectorate is authorized to exercise supervision in the matter The Data Inspectorate's competence follows from the main rule that each supervisory authority is competent in the territory of its own Member State (Article 55 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation). The current treatment is a step 20 in Google's search engine business and is affiliated with it obligation arising from such activities to ensure that the activities 19 Appendix 27.2, pp. 2-3. 20 See the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 13 May 2014, Google Spain and Google, C-131/12, paragraph 41 and the judgment of 24 September 2019, G.C. and others, C-136/17 point 35.Datainspektionen DI-2018-9274 1 6 (31) 21 meets the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation. Google has in letter of the 12th December 2018 to the data protection authorities stated that it is Google (it that is, Google LLC based in the United States) which determines the purposes and the means of that treatment and that this is not affected by them organizational changes that the company made on January 22, 2019. The 22 organizational changes referred to is that Google from this date has a principal place of business in Ireland regarding parts of their business. A principal place of business shall have the authority to: make decisions regarding the purposes and means of the treatment in question (Article 4.16 and recital 36). Google has not shown that Google Ireland has such powers in the field of search engine business. The Data Inspectorate considers because the single point of contact mechanism (Articles 56 and 60) does not is applicable and that the Data Inspectorate is thus the competent supervisory authority in the case. 2.4.2.2 The messages constitute personal data processing The Data Inspectorate finds that the messages in question are personal data and that the fact that Google sends the messages means that Google processes personal data for the following reasons. As can be seen from the expression “each information ""in the definition of the concept of personal data (Article 4 (1)) shall: the term is given a broad meaning. It includes both objective and subjective information if they ""refer"" to a specific person, which is the case they, because of their content, purpose or effect, are attached to a person. 23 The information that Google has granted a search hit to a particular URL to be deleted refers to a person, especially since the use of the data affects the person's rights and interests, for example by being able to 24 be used to counter the purpose of the request. For that to be the case a personal data is not required that the information itself makes it possible to identify the person or that all information necessary for identification is held by a person. The question of whether someone is identifiable should assessed on the basis of the aids that can reasonably be used by someone to identify the person. A person is not considered identifiable if the risk of it in practice is negligible. In the present case, the risk is not 21EU Court Judgment of 24 September 2019, G.C. and others, C-136/17 paragraph 43. 22 Appendix 50 50 appendices 1 and 2. Judgment of the European Court of Justice of the European Communities of 20 December 2017, Nowak, C-434/16, paragraphs 34-35. 24See by analogy the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 20 December 2017, Nowak, C-434/16, paragraph 39. 25 Judgment of the European Court of Justice of 19 October 2016, Breyer, C-582/14, paragraphs 41, 43 and 46. Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 1 7 (31) negligible, since a granted request for removal is by definition linked to a person's name. Identification can thus be done directly about it there is only one name on the web page that the search results lead to. If it exists several names on the website, you can instead take one name at a time and search the name of the search engine. In one of these searches, the search result does not appear appear and thereby indirectly reveal that it is the person who requested and granted removal. 2.4.2.3 There is no legal support for sending the messages The Data Inspectorate finds that Google has no legal basis for the treatment and that it is also not permitted on the basis that it would be consistent with the original purposes for which the data were collected in. Google thus processes personal data without having a valid legal basis grounds for processing in breach of Articles 5 and 6 of the Data Protection Regulation. The reasons for the assessment are set out below. The notices are not supported by a legal obligation Google claims that the processing is based on a legal obligation (Article 6.1 (c) in accordance with Article 17 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation or, as may be understood, in accordance with Article 5 (4) of the EU Platforms Regulation, and that it is also to be considered as industry practice according to proposals and recommendations from the Commission. The Data Inspectorate finds that the processing is not supported by Article 17 (2) the Data Protection Regulation for the following reasons. The wording states that the provision imposes personal data controllers who have published personal data an obligation to take reasonable steps to inform personal data controllers who then reuse this personal data via links, copies or reproductions. Such an obligation to provide information does not apply search engine providers when engaging in the activity that the right to removal applies in relation to, namely to locate information such as contains personal data that has been published or posted on the internet by third men, index it automatically, store it temporarily and finally make it available to internet users according to a certain priority scheme. In addition, search engine providers, who has received a request to delete a search hit, informs it 26 Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019. 27 Judgment of the European Court of Justice of 13 May 2014, Google Spain and Google, C-131/12, paragraph 41 and the judgment of September 24, 2019, G.C. et al., C-136/17 point 33 and 35.Datainspektionen DI-2018-9274 1 8 (31) third party who published the information on the internet as the search hit refers to. The purpose of the obligation under Article 17 (2) is to add greater responsibility for the personal data controller for the original publication which the search hit refers to and that individuals should not be forced to produce several requests for deletion. The requirements are higher for the one who originally has published the data shall grant a request for deletion than to a a search engine provider shall grant a request for deletion of a search result which refers to the original publication of the data. It can notes that the opinion of the Article 29 Working Party in the WP225 Guidelines, that messages such as those in the case current from search engine providers to webmasters do not have a legal basis under the data protection rules, 28 is still valid. The Data Inspectorate finds that the processing is not supported by Article 5 (4) i the Platform Regulation for the following reasons. First, note The Data Inspectorate that the regulation was adopted on 20 June 2019 and will be applied only from 12 July 2020 (Article 19) and thus not yet valid. For it others, it is clear from the purpose and scope of that regulation that it shall be without prejudice to Union law applicable to, inter alia in the field of data protection (Article 1.5). It is further stated that the requirements in the Platforms Regulation should not be seen as an obligation for a search engine provider to disseminate personal information to its business users and that any processing of personal data should take place in accordance with the legal framework of the Union for the protection of individuals with regard to processing of personal data and respect for privacy and protection of personal data, in particular the Data Protection Regulation (recital 35). As noted in the previous paragraph and developed in the following two sections (on legitimate interest and purpose limitation) speaks the circumstances of it the present case against the treatment being allowed or justified because the display of a search hit may be illegal without the original the publication is. A webmaster's interest in knowing that a search hit does not appear when searching on a person's name is weak compared to those interests that apply in the cases covered by the Platforms Regulation protect (recitals 1-5). Against the same background, the treatment can not, such as 28Se EDPB, Guidelines 5/2019 “on the Criteria of the Right to be Forgotten in the search engine cases under the GDPR ”(part 1), adopted on 2 December 2019 for the public consultation, pp. 4-5, with reference to the WP225 guidelines, item 23.Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 1 9 (31) Google alleged, is considered compatible with established and prevalent industry practice. The messages are not supported by a legitimate interest Google claims that the treatment is based on Google's legitimate interest (Article 6 (1) (f)) of 'informing the webmaster, as a key stakeholder, that a URL that links to the webmaster's webpage has been removed having regard to the \[Data Protection Regulation\] '. Google states that consideration should ensure that the individual is informed of and can expect treatment, which can have a positive effect on him by removing the data from the original web page. Furthermore, Google believes that the information does not constitute specific categories of personal data, minimized as far as possible and only shared with a recipient who already has access to them. The Data Inspectorate finds that Google's processing is not permitted reference to any of the interests expressed by Google. None of the conditions of Article 6 (1) (f) are met, namely the existence of a legitimate interest of the controller or third party, that the treatment is necessary for the legitimate interest sought and that the interests of the individual or fundamental freedoms and rights do not weigh heavier and requires protection of personal data. 30 Google has first stated that the treatment may lead to it webmaster deletes the original data, i.e. what gets perceived as the webmaster's interest in trying their own possible obligation to delete the information from the website. The Data Inspectorate notes, however, that the interest relied on by Google is hypothetical the time of processing, because Google does not know about it webmasters have an interest in making any such assessment. It is thus not a legitimate interest within the meaning of the Data Protection Regulation. 31 The treatment can then also not be considered necessary. The webmaster interests can, in a balance of interests, also not be considered to outweigh those registered fundamental rights and freedoms. 29Act Annex 45, p. 14. 30 See the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 4 May 2017, Rīgas satiksme, C ‑ 13/16, paragraph 28. Judgment of the European Court of Justice of the European Communities of 11 December 2019, TK, C ‑ 708/18, paragraph 44.Datainspektionen DI-2018-9274 2 0 (31) In addition, Google has invoked the public's legitimate interest in Google does not make erroneous removal decisions. The Data Inspectorate finds that Google only sends the messages after Google has already deleted one search hit, ie after Google has already made the required balance in order not to make wrong decisions. It is thus not an actual interest in the time of treatment. It is thus not a legitimate interest in 32 meaning of the Data Protection Regulation. If what Google has stated regarding incorrect decisions should instead be perceived as that the legitimate interest is the public interest in making wrong decisions whether deleting search results afterwards can be corrected to is The Data Inspectorate's assessment is that the processing is not necessary. The information that Google has removed a URL is not sufficient to the webmaster should be able to assess whether the decision is incorrect, then it webmasters lack knowledge of what the individual has stated in their request. The Data Inspectorate also assesses that the individual's interests weigh heavier based on the following circumstances. The fact that the data protection authorities in the WP225 guidelines (paragraph 23) explicitly advised against search engine providers from submitting such messages argue that it would be permissible in a balance of interests. Only Google and the individual know that Google has granted one request for removal. By Google disclosing the information to third parties this is a more serious violation than if the data had been publicly available.33 The disclosure of the information to the webmaster also takes place without adequate safeguards, as Google has not shown that the company can guarantee or have any opportunity to influence that the webmaster does not use the information in an improper manner or that the information is not disclosed to third-party webmasters who are not subject to adequate safeguards. As for the legitimate expectations of the individual, Google certainly has informed in its web form that the treatment may take place, but Judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of 11 December 2019, TK, C ‑ 708/18, paragraph 44. 33 Judgment of the European Court of Justice of 24 November 2011, Asociación Nacional de Establecimientos Financieros de Crédito, C ‑ 468/10 and C ‑ 469/10, paragraph 45. Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 2 1 (31) has done this in a misleading way that gives the impression that the treatment must be approved by the individual for the removal request to is handled, or that the processing follows from Google's legal obligation to handle request. It must be borne in mind that Google has not informed them registered that the legal basis for the processing is justified interest pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) (Article 13 (1) (c)), the company or third parties legitimate interests which make the treatment necessary (Article 13 (1) (d)) or the company's intention to transfer the data to third countries (Article 13 (1) (f)). It has nor has it emerged that Google has expressly notified the individual on the right of the individual under Article 21 (1) to object at any time treatment based on a legitimate interest and clearly stated, clear and distinct from other information (Article 21 (4)). Against this background, the treatment is not allowed on the basis of a justified interest. The messages are not compatible with the original purpose Finally, Google claims that the sending of the message is compatible with the original purpose for which the data was collected, ie Google obligation to remove search results in certain cases on request (Article 17 (1) and (3)). According to Google, the purpose of the treatment is to “give the webmaster one possibility to delete the actual content of the web page, as this increases impact on the right to be forgotten ”. Google thus claims that the company sends these messages in accordance with Article 6 (4) of the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Protection Regulation contains criteria for determining whether a processing for other purposes is consistent with the purposes for which the data originally collected or if the treatment violates the principle of purpose limitation in Article 5 (1) (b) of the Data Protection Regulation (points (a) to (e) (i) Article 6 (4) and recital 50). Several of the circumstances that are relevant according to these criteria have already been described in the previous section and will therefore only summarized here. The Data Inspectorate states that the current processing is unfounded with the consent of the data subject or Union law or that of the Member States national law. Furthermore, the Data Inspectorate states in accordance with the criteria in Article 6 (4) that the link between the objectives (point (a)) is weak; as stated in the previous section, the possibilities of the data subjects and rights regarding requests to search engine suppliers and the Swedish Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 2 2 (31) website owners are not equivalent. The context is not like that either that the latter treatment is what the individual can typically expect (point (b)), which is not altered by the information provided by Google the treatment in its web form as that information is misleading. To a request for removal made and granted may in itself be considered as personal data of a privacy-sensitive nature (point c). In addition, it speaks for itself that a request for removal has been granted to the underlying the information on the website is often such particularly sensitive information or criminal offenses referred to in Articles 9 and 10 of the Data Protection Regulation. The consequences of the subsequent treatment (point d) can generally be considered negative for the individual and can even be used to counteract the purpose of request. The individual is also not obliged to turn first or at the same time to the webmaster where the data was published and request that it be deleted and can also be assumed to have a worse chance of success with one request due to the fact that the original publication may have a stronger freedom of expression protection. In addition, knowledge of the search engine granted a request is assumed to entail the risk that some webmasters will try circumvent the deletion decision by republishing the information on a other address or otherwise disseminate them. As stated above, Google has has not shown that the company has set up any guarantees or protective measures to counteract this (point e). Google does not test the suitability of sending the messages in the individual case and also does not offer the individual any opportunity to object. Google's routine in general to deal with deletion, namely only based on specific URLs, with requirements for new requests even when the same content is republished, entails a risk that individuals are exposed to unnecessary suffering as a result of the treatment. An example of this is search result 2 i complaint 8, where the company had blocked the search hit as the Data Inspectorate resubmitted, but where the same content reappeared in the search results then the webmaster republished the content on the same site, but on a new URL. The individuals themselves must monitor and react to any republishing in the company's search services. This erodes the effectiveness of their rights and is therefore not in their interest. Judgment of the European Court of Justice of 13 May 2014, Google Spain and Google, C-131/12, paragraph 83 and 85 and the judgment of September 24, 2019, G.C. and others, C-136/17, paragraph 52 and Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting, Item 81.Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 2 3 (31) The Data Inspectorate finds that Google does not support Article 6 (4) and that the procedure infringes the principle of purpose limitation in Article 5 (1) (b) of the Data Protection Regulation. 2.4.2.4 The information to individuals violates the principle of transparency Google has stated that the purpose of the information to the individuals in the web form that messages are sent to webmasters is that meet the requirements of the right to information and the principle of legality, accuracy and transparency and that this follows from practice. 35 The Data Inspectorate does not question that Google is obliged to inform them registered which recipients will have access to their information pursuant to Article 13 (1) (e), but notes that the obligation to provide information is intended to: protect the data subjects. As stated in the previous section, it is current transfer is illegal and to the detriment of the individual. Like there too Google has provided misleading information to individuals about it legal basis on which the treatment is based. In addition, the data protection authorities jointly, and the Data Inspectorate in particular, previously alerted Google to the shortcomings of the routine of submitting such messages without Google fixing it. In addition, Google requires that they individuals approve the procedure for submitting a request for removing. Against this background, the information provided by Google appears leaves to individuals about the treatment as misleading in a way that may considered to be conducive to persuading individuals to refrain from exercising their right to request removing. By doing so, Google is processing personal data in violation of the principle of transparency in Article 5 (1) (a) of the Data Protection Regulation. 3 Choice of intervention 3.1 Possible intervention measures The Data Inspectorate has a number of corrective powers available according to Article 58 (2) (a) to (j) of the Data Protection Regulation, inter alia to impose it Judgment of the European Court of Justice of 16 January 2019, Deutche Post AG, C-496/17, paragraph 59 and Judgment of 1 October 2015, Bara and Others, C-201/14, paragraph 34. Judgment of the European Court of Justice of 7 May 2009, Rijkeboer, C-553/07, paragraphs 34-35. Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 2 4 (31) personal data controller to ensure that the processing takes place in accordance with Regulation and, if necessary, in a specific way and within a specific period. Of point (i) of Article 58 (2) and Article 83 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation it appears that the Data Inspectorate has the authority to impose administrative penalty fees in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the circumstances of in the individual case, administrative penalty fees shall be imposed in addition to or in instead of the other measures referred to in Article 58 (2). Furthermore, it appears from the article 83.2 which factors are to be taken into account when deciding on administrative penalty fees shall be imposed and in determining the size of the fee. If it is a question of a minor violation, the Data Inspectorate receives according to what set out in recital 148 of the Data Protection Regulation instead of imposing a issue a reprimand in accordance with Article 58 (2) (c) aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the case, such as the infringement nature, severity and duration as well as previous violations of relevance. 3.2 Order The Data Inspectorate has found that Google by regularly submitting notification to webmasters that search results have been removed processing personal data in breach of Articles 5 (1) (b) and 6 of the Data Protection Regulation. Furthermore, it has been found that Google provides misleading information about the transmission of such messages in a manner contrary to Article 5 (1) (a) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. Google should therefore be instructed to ensure that the processing of these parts takes place in in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation as follows. The Data Inspectorate submits pursuant to Article 58 (2) (d) i Google's Data Protection Regulation that, as far as removal requests are concerned of displaying search results when searching for individuals' names using Google search services that can be done from Sweden,  stop informing webmasters of URLs when Google has granted a request except in cases where the individual has requested det.Datainspektionen DI-2018-9274 2 5 (31)  cease to display the text “If URLs are removed from ours search results as a result of your request, we can provide information to them webmasters for the deleted URLs ”in their web form for request for removal or provide similar information to individuals if it is not clear that webmasters are only informed about that a request has been granted if the individual has requested it. 3.3 Circumstances of significance for whether a penalty fee is to be imposed 3.3.1 What Google has stated Google has stated that in the case of complaints 2 and 8, these are isolated cases events concerning two individual data subjects and are consequences of acceptable and well-founded interpretations of applicable law. It can not be consistent with the intent or overall purpose of the Data Protection Regulation to impose excessive penalties for infringements relating to individual material interpretations of existing right with little or no impact on data subjects. In the present case has no damage was shown at all with respect to the alleged the infringements. If high levels of sanctions were to be applied for relatively small infringements and isolated events and with little or no impact on registered, they would risk as a tool to ensure compliance lose its effect because data controllers would have nothing incentives to strive for compliance at a systematic level. In summary, Google claims that the following circumstances should considered mitigating. It is a matter of isolated events, which have been going on for a limited time and concerns a limited number of registered who have not suffered any damage as a result of the alleged infringements. Google has notified the data subjects that they can complain to the Data Inspectorate. Google has has not been intentional or has been negligent and cannot be considered as principal or solely responsible. Google complies with the Data Protection Regulation on a systematic level and act in accordance with a code of conduct by following WP225 guidelines. Google has cooperated with the Data Inspectorate. Google have not gained any financial benefits or avoided losses. 3.3.2 Assessment of the infringement concerning complaints 2 In the mitigating direction, the circumstance speaks that the infringement only concerns one person.Datainspektionen DI-2018-9274 2 6 (31) The following circumstances point in an aggravating direction. The violation is a step in a systematic procedure because it follows the procedures of Google. Further are the current categories of data, such as sensitive data and criminal offenses, particularly worthy of protection. If a search result leads to a web page with such personal information about a person, it can have a significant impact on his fundamental rights with respect to privacy and the protection of personal data and constitute an exceptional 37 serious intervention. It should typically result in damaged reputation, unauthorized disclosure and significant financial disadvantage for individuals, whereby it should be mentioned that the appellant in the present case has likened the effect of the violation that a professional ban would have been issued against him. 38 Google has not taken sufficient measures to alleviate the damage, but let the search meeting remains despite the Data Inspectorate's previous decision. The infringement has lasted for about 4.5 months during the time that the Data Protection Ordinance has been applicable. Because the procedure followed Google's procedures, this is not the case an individual mistake without the action has been done intentionally. It can too finds that Google has failed to comply with the order The Data Inspectorate announced in the previous decision on the basis of section 45 the Personal Data Act and the Data Protection Directive to cease the treatment. Because Google requires individuals to enter an exact URL in Google's web form and does not investigate requests covers more than that, the company at least indirectly avoids costs. 3.3.3 Assessment of the infringement concerning complaints 8 In the mitigating direction, the circumstances indicate that the infringement only concerns one person and that the time the infringement has been going on while data protection ordinance has been applicable, about two weeks, is a relative short time. The following circumstances speak in an aggravating direction. The Data Inspectorate has found that Google had failed to comply with the order the supervisory authority announced in the previous decision on the basis of § 45 the Personal Data Act and the Data Protection Directive to cease processing and which became final on May 24, 2018. Google has done regarding that the company intended to comply with a legally binding agreement 37 European Court of Justice judgment of 24 September 2019, G.C. and others, C-136/17, paragraphs 44 and 46. 38 See file appendix 31, p. 2.Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 2 7 (31) injunction, but on the other hand has not shown due diligence by correcting itself at the discretion of the regulatory authority by temporarily restricting the display of the search results pending court review or even when Google according to own information on 23 May 2018 was served the judgment that upheld Data Inspectorate assessment. Regarding the current categories of information has been about criminal information, which is particularly sensitive to privacy. If a search result leads to a web page with such personal information about one person, it can have a significant impact on their fundamentals rights regarding respect for privacy and the protection of personal data and constitute a particularly serious interference. It dared typically result in damaged reputation, unauthorized disclosure and significant financial disadvantage for individuals, whereby it should be mentioned that the appellant in it The present case has been likened to the effect of the infringement by a professional ban should have been communicated to him. Google has not taken enough measures to alleviate the damage, but left the search hit in spite The Data Inspectorate's decision and the court's judgment. Because the procedure followed Google's routines have been intentional. Assessment of the infringement regarding notification to webmasters and information to individuals The following circumstances are aggravating. The infringement intended to send message is such that it erodes the effectiveness of the right to removal and affects anyone who has been granted a removal request. For the current period, potentially 5,690 people can be covered by procedure. The infringement regarding misleading information affects anyone who may have an interest in making such a request. The current category of information, ie that someone has requested and been granted removal, may typically considered to be a task for which the individual does not want to be disclosed the webmaster or someone else, as the task can be used for to counteract the purpose of the request. The infringements thus cause damage in form of lost opportunity for the individual to exercise their rights, lack of control over their personal data and unauthorized disclosure. The infringements has been going on since May 25, 2018 and is still going on. It appears from the investigation into the case that Google has been aware of the treatment and so that it was done intentionally. Since the procedure can be assumed to entail that Judgment of the European Court of Justice of 24 September 2019, G.C. and others, C-136/17, paragraphs 44 and 46. 40The previous decision, p. 31.Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 2 8 (31) Individuals refrain from requesting removal Google avoids in any case indirect costs. 3.3.5 Penalty fees shall be imposed The proceedings covered by this supervision concerning complaints 2 and 8 thereof previous decision has meant that Google processes data such as The Data Inspectorate in previous decisions found that Google treated in violation of the Personal Data Act and the Data Protection Directive and instructed Google to cease. It can thus not be considered an excuse, material misinterpretations. It also shows a lack of respect for the rights of individuals and are thus not minor infringements within the meaning of recital 148 in the preamble the Data Protection Regulation. There is thus no reason to replace one penalty fee with a reprimand. There is no other corrective action current. Google will therefore be subject to administrative penalty fees for the infringements. The procedure to send message to webmasters and the information provided to the individual in the web form is done systematically and at risk to put the right to removal out of play. It's not about less infringements. There is no reason to replace a penalty fee with one reprimand. Nor is it enough that Google is ordered to cease with the procedure. Google will therefore be subject to administrative penalty fees also for these violations. 3.4 Determination of the amount of the penalty fee 3.4.1 General provisions According to Article 83 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, each supervisory authority shall: ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty fees in each individual cases are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The Data Inspectorate has found that Google has violated Articles 5, 6, 9, 10 and 17 of the Data Protection Regulation. These Articles are covered by Article 83 (5), which means that a higher penalty amount can be imposed. According to ch. 6 Section 3 of the Data Protection Act, the Data Inspectorate may also levy one penalty for infringements of Article 10 of the Data Protection Regulation and shall then apply Article 83 (1), (2) and (3) and determine the amount of the fee pursuant to Article 83 (5). Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 29 (31) According to Article 83 (3), the administrative penalty fee may not exceed the amount of the most serious infringement in the case of one or the same data processing or interconnected data processing. As regards the calculation of the amount, Article 83 (5) (i) the Data Protection Regulation that companies that commit infringements are the ones in question may be subject to penalty fees of up to EUR 20 million or four percent of total global annual sales in the previous financial year, depending on which value is highest. 3.4.2 The amount at which penalty fees can be determined When determining the maximum amount for a penalty fee to be imposed on one companies, the definition of the term company must be used as the European Court of Justice apply in application of Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU (see recital) 150 of the Data Protection Regulation). It is clear from the case - law of the Court that this includes any entity engaged in economic activities, regardless of the entity's legal form and method of financing and whether the entity in legal meaning consists of several natural or legal persons. 41 The Data Inspectorate assesses that the company's turnover is to be added basis for calculating the administrative penalty fees that Google can imposed is Google's parent company Alphabet Inc (Alphabet). Of collected data, Alphabet's global annual sales in 2018 were approximately 136,819,000,000 US dollars (USD), which is equivalent to approximately 119,500,000,000 euros 43 44 (EUR). This corresponds to approximately SEK 1,280,000,000,000. The highest the amount of the sanction that can be determined in the case is four percent of this amount, that is to say about 51 200 000 000 (fifty-one billion two hundred million) kronor. 41Article 29 Working Group, Guidelines for the application and determination of administrative penalty fees in accordance with Regulation 2016/679 (WP253 Guidelines), p. 6. 42A ktbilaga 40, s. 47. 43 Based on the exchange rate USD to EUR as of March 9, 2020 according to European central banks, 0.8729. 44Due to the exchange rate EUR to SEK as of March 9, 2020 according to European central bank, 10.7203.Data Inspectorate DI-2018-9274 3 0 (31) 3.4.3 Determining the size of the penalty fee In order for penalty fees to be effective and dissuasive, according to The Data Inspectorate's opinion on the turnover of the data controller be taken into account in determining the size of the penalty fees. One proportionality assessment must also be made in each individual case. In a proportionality assessment, one must ensure that the penalty fee does not become too high in relation to the current infringements. Thereby shall take into account that the complaints concern two people and that the routine to regularly notify webmasters of deletion and information to individual refers Sweden and in the current case can amount to 5,690 registered. At the same time penalty fees must be effective and dissuasive. Overall, the Data Inspectorate finds that an efficient, proportionate and dissuasive penalty for the infringements found Complaints 2 and 8 are SEK 25,000,000 (twenty-five million) message to webmasters and misleading information to individuals is 50,000,000 (fifty million) kronor. Against this background, the Data Inspectorate decides with the support of ch. § 3 the Data Protection Act and Articles 58 (2) and 83 of the Data Protection Regulation that Google will pay an administrative penalty fee of 75,000,000 (seventy-five) million).

Karolinska University Hospital in its capacity as the controller does not comply with the requirement that it has carried out a needs and risk analysis before the allocation of authorisations are made in the TakeCare medical record system, in accordance with Chapter 4, Section 2 § and Chapter 6. 7 § Patient Data Act (2008:355) and Chapter 4 § 2 The National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations and general advice (HSLF-FS 2016:40) on record keeping and processing of personal data in health and health care. This means that Karolinska University Hospital does not has taken appropriate organisational measures to be able to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing of personal data has a level of security appropriate to the risks involved. 2. Karolinska University Hospital does not have limited user permissions for accessing the medical record system TakeCare to what is needed only for the user to be able to carry out their duties in the health sector under Chapter 4, Section 2 and Chapter 6. 7 of the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4, Section 2 HSLF-FS 2016:40. This means that Karolinska The University Hospital has not taken measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate adequate security for personal data. The Data Protection Inspectorate decides on the basis of Articles 58(2) and 83 of the the General Data Protection Regulation and Chapter 6, Section 2 of the Act (2018:218) with supplementary provisions to the EU Data Protection Regulation that Karolinska Universitetssjukhuset, for infringement of Article 5(1)(f) and (2) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free flow of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Data Protection Regulation). 1 and Article 32(1) and (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation shall pay a an administrative fine of SEK 4 000 000 (four million). The Data Protection Inspectorate, on the basis of Article 58(2)(d) of the the General Data Protection Regulation Karolinska University Hospital to ensure that the necessary needs and risk analysis is carried out and documented for the TakeCare medical record system and then, with the support of needs and risk analysis, each user is assigned individual access rights to personal data to only what is necessary for the individual to carry out their duties in the health sector, in accordance with Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32(1) and (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, Chapter 4, Section 2, and Chapter 6. 7 § Patient Data Act and 4 ch. 2 § HSLF-FS 2016:40. Description of the supervision case The Swedish Data Protection Authority initiated supervision by letter on 22 March 2019 and has on site on 27 March 2019 examined whether Karolinska University Hospital's decisions on the allocation of authorisations have been preceded by a needs and risk analysis. The audit has also covered how Karolinska The University Hospital assigned permissions for access to the main medical record system TakeCare, and what access possibilities they assigned the competences provide within the framework of the internal secrecy according to chapter 4. the Patient Data Act, as the coherent record keeping according to Chapter 6. patient data law. In addition, the Swedish Data Protection Authority has also examined which documentation of access (logs) available in the record system. The Swedish Data Protection Authority has only examined users' access to system, i.e. what health care documentation the user actually can take part in and read. The review does not cover the functions that included in the permission, i.e. what the user can actually do in the medical record system (e.g. issuing prescriptions, writing referrals, etc.). Previous review of Karolinska University Hospital's authorisation management The Swedish Data Protection Authority has previously conducted an inspection of Karolinska University Hospital's access control etc. By the Data Inspectorate Decision 920-2012, notified on 26 August 2013, states that Karolinska University Hospital was instructed, among other things, to carry out a needs and risk analysis as a basis for assigning authorisations in TakeCare. With Following the decision, Karolinska University Hospital submitted a written reply of 18 December 2013, stating, inter alia, that Karolinska The university hospital had started work on an action plan and a needs and risk analysis. What has emerged in the case Karolinska University Hospital has essentially stated the following. Controller Karolinska University Hospital is a separate authority within Region Stockholm. The Board of Karolinska University Hospital is controller for the processing of personal data by Karolinska University Hospital performs in the main medical record system TakeCare. Organisation Care at Karolinska University Hospital is organised on the basis of medical themes and a number of functions that bring together competences. Wards, clinics and day care are organised according to themes. Each theme is divided into a number of patient areas, which bring together similar patient flows. Function is an area of expertise that cuts across theme. A function assists with skills and resources, which are used in many different patient groups and thus in several themes. There is a a patient area manager and a functional area manager for each area. Journal system Karolinska University Hospital uses TakeCare as main medical record system, and participates in TakeCare's coherent journal entries. Karolinska University Hospital manages TakeCare, and has signed the contract with the supplier. Karolinska University Hospital has thus a large number of data-processing and sub-processing agreements with other health care providers. There is both a regional and a local organisation for TakeCare. The regional organisation consists of a management group (steering group), which in addition to Karolinska University Hospital consists of representatives of six other health care providers. Users and patients Karolinska University Hospital has almost 16,000 employees in total. The number users of the medical record system TakeCare who are employed at Karolinska University Hospital is 12 285, of which 1 328 users are inactive. At the time of the inspection, there were therefore 10 957 active users. A user account is automatically deactivated if no login has been made for 60 days. The TakeCare medical record system contains records for about 3 million patients. Of these, 1 970 000 patient records are registered on, and de facto patients at, Karolinska University Hospital. The unified record keeping in TakeCare covers about 200-400 health care providers. It is now possible to search for all personal identity numbers available i TakeCare. However, there are discussions at regional level to limit in some cases the possibility of seeking information for a limited number of patients, to for example, patients in a particular residence. Internal confidentiality Needs and risk analysis Karolinska University Hospital cannot submit any completed needs and risk analysis for TakeCare. It is the respective patient area and functional area manager who will carry out and document the needs and risk analyses before assigning permissions. However, it is regularly investigated what the needs are and what permissions should be assigned to employees, e.g. for new hires. The template for needs and risk analyses available in Karolinska University Hospital's guidelines are not filled in regularly. Karolinska University Hospital is unable to answer whether the work initiated following the Data Inspectorate's previous supervisory decision of 26 August 2013 resulted in a needs and risk analysis for TakeCare. Following the inspection, Karolinska University Hospital has begun work to ensure that needs and risk assessments are carried out throughout the organization. Among other things, a needs and risk analysis has been carried out for the Perioperative Medicine and Intensive Care function in accordance with Karolinska University Hospital Guidelines. Granting access to personal data of patients There are approximately 40 authorization profiles in TakeCare that contain functions such as ""reading recipes"". Of these, 26 are so-called read functions. There are, for example, two authorisation profiles for nurses, where the difference between the profiles is that one has automated login. This means that logging in takes place automatically at the care unit you belong to for one eligibility profile, but not for the other. Also for doctors there are there are two eligibility profiles. The difference between the profiles is that one has access to a so-called emergency ligature. As a user you can have several different eligibility profiles, up to a maximum of five. For example, a medical candidate may have been assigned permissions from multiple entities. Staff tick cases themselves in the journal filter in TakeCare, which means that they make a active choice to access patient information on different devices. If a user ticks the ""all devices"" option, no further active choice to access patient information from all units. Although it are different access profiles, Karolinska states that users ""have access to all patients in TakeCare"". All accounts are individual, i.e. there is no account that multiple users can use (group account). In the policy document ""Decision on the allocation of competences"" from 2015 (latest updated on 23 October 2018)2 provides a general description of the regulatory framework and the conditions for assigning permissions. It also contains a description of an approach to conducting a needs and risk analysis, based on the user's need to have access to personal data concerning patients in their work and refers to the assignment of eligibility profile. In the guideline further recalls certain relevant issues. It is also stated that some of the examples do not match with the eligibility profiles available. After the inspection, Karolinska University Hospital carried out a needs and risk analysis for the Perioperative Medicine and Intensive Care function. In this the risks to be taken into account are those that arise if employees within the business do not have access to relevant information, and risks related to too broad or generous access to patient information. The guideline ""Assignment of permissions"" has been developed by lawyers and established by the Chief Medical Officer in the area of quality and patient safety. 2 Access to personal data of patients in the Stockholm County Health Care Area During the inspection it was found that users at Karolinska The University Hospital has access to data on patients in The Stockholm County Health Authority (SLSO). According to Karolinska University Hospital, this is due to the fact that Karolinska University Hospital and SLSO are listed as ""one and the same"" care unit in TakeCare. This means that users at Karolinska University Hospital technically have access also to information on patients at SLSO within the internal confidentiality, and vice versa. Regarding the background and motives for Karolinska University Hospital and SLSO is listed as a care unit in TakeCare, Karolinska University Hospital referred to an enforcement decision dated 2010-01 and minutes of the Board meeting. The minutes show that the director of the county council has established in the enforcement decision that County Council (SLL) administrations that provide health care belong to care provider SLL and that this means that Karolinska University Hospital and SLSO, until further notice, shall remain unchanged as one and the same healthcare providers in TakeCare. Coherent record keeping Needs and risk analysis No needs and risks analysis has been carried out before the staff has allowed access to other health care providers' health care documentation in the context of coherent record keeping. Granting access to personal data of patients Users at Karolinska University Hospital have access to other healthcare providers' data on patients in TakeCare within the framework of coherent record keeping. Access is prepared on a patient basis, and requires the patient's consent. When searching for a patient, the healthcare providers who the patient has previously sought care from. This gives an indication that it may there is information about the patient at another healthcare provider. Information can be important when prescribing medicines, for example. By making a active selection and clicking on a specific device, you can access information. There is a decision from the Stockholm Region that every care provider who chooses to use the TakeCare medical record system must also be included in the coherent record keeping. Karolinska University Hospital has a policy document ""Access to patient record, guideline"", effective from 17 August 20183. Guideline contains a general description of the regulatory framework and sets out the conditions for accessing the care documentation in TakeCare in certain situations. Technical limitations in TakeCare regarding access to personal data of patients The technical limitations on user access that used by Karolinska University Hospital relates to so-called protected units i TakeCare. There are currently six such units, including ANNOVA, SESAM reception and the child protection team. In the case of sheltered care units, it is not possible to limit competences at individual level, but access to medical record documentation for these patients is limited to a defined user group. The protected devices are not visible when record keeping and they are not included in the default profile role in the record filter. Decisions on protected units have been preceded by an assessment based on both a patient safety as well as a privacy perspective. Protected care units is currently used only to a limited extent. This is because a more widespread use would pose significant patient safety risks. Karolinska University Hospital has stated in a supplementary statement the following. Technical restrictions on access by individual managers: The TakeCare electronic health record system allows access to be restricted by the healthcare facility can control what information each user group (usually professional group) at the device can see and what each user group can do. The healthcare unit can also control what information other user groups at other healthcare facilities can see or do. However, as TakeCare is configured today, it only allows control on The guideline ""Access to patient records, guideline"" is developed by lawyers and established by the Chief Medical Officer in the area of quality and patient safety. 3 user group level. Any possibility of technical restriction for individual managers access facilities are not available. This applies both to so-called internal confidentiality and to the framework for access through single entry. As regards the hospital's so-called protected it is also not possible to restrict permissions at the individual level, but access to the medical records of these patients is limited to a defined user group. The possibility for a healthcare provider to opt out of access to the other healthcare providers' patient documentation in TakeCare Following a decision by the Stockholm Region, every healthcare provider who chooses to use the TakeCare medical record system is also included in the coherent medical record system. This means that a healthcare providers cannot restrict other healthcare providers' access to their own healthcare records. However, the individual healthcare provider can control its users' access to data in the coherent record keeping. The TakeCare journal system offers features that provide the healthcare provider may restrict the access of its users in such a way that they can only has access to medical records from, for example, a designated group with other health care providers. To illustrate this, Karolinska University has referred to a screenshot, showing eligibility by provider. From the screenshot it can be seen that at the device level it is possible to control the eligibility of a unit's users in relation to other healthcare providers devices by setting them to ""view documents"" or ""do not view documents"" lists. The latter list shows that it is possible to block units of other health care providers. However, it does not appear that the function exists per provider, but you have to block all devices of the current provider if you want to block a healthcare provider. Documentation of access (logs) Karolinska University Hospital has presented various logs and stated in essentially the following. There are two types of logs, in-depth logs and targeted logs. In-depth log information can be requested on either the user (the employee) or on the patient. Targeted log information can be requested by for example a patient. From a screenshot, showing the documentation in logs, it appears that data recorded in the log; patient, status, time, user, system, the server call (action) performed and from which care unit the action was performed. Grounds for the decision Current rules GDPR the primary source of law The General Data Protection Regulation, often abbreviated GDPR, was introduced on 25 May 2018 and is the primary legal framework for processing personal data. This also applies to health care. The basic principles for the processing of personal data are set out in Article 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation. A fundamental principle is the requirement of security under Article 5(1)(f), which states that personal data shall be processed in a way that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against loss, destruction or accidental damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures. Article 5(2) sets out the so-called ""accountability"", i.e. that the controller is responsible for and can demonstrate that the the basic principles set out in paragraph 1 are complied with. Article 24 deals with the responsibility of the controller. Article 24(1) it is stated that the controller is responsible for implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate that the processing is carried out in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation. The measures shall be carried out taking into account the nature, scope, context of the processing and purposes and the risks, of varying degrees of probability and severity, to rights and freedoms of natural persons. The measures will be reviewed and updated if necessary. Article 32 regulates the security of the processing. According to paragraph 1 the controller and the processor shall take into account of recent developments, implementation costs and treatment nature, scope, context and purpose, and the risks, of varying likelihood and severity, to the rights and freedoms of natural persons take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk (...). Paragraph 2 provides that when assessing the appropriate level of safety, particular account is taken of the risks processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or to unauthorised disclosure of or access to the personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. Recital 75 states that in assessing the risk to natural persons rights and freedoms, various factors must be taken into account. These include personal data covered by the obligation of professional secrecy, data concerning health or sexual life, if there is processing of personal data relating to vulnerable natural persons, especially children, or if the treatment involves a large number of personal data and concerns a large number of data subjects. Furthermore, it follows from recital 76 that the likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects should be determined on the basis of the nature, scope, context and purpose. The risk should be evaluated on on the basis of an objective assessment, which determines whether the data processing involves a risk or a high risk. Recitals 39 and 83 also contain wording providing guidance on the more detailed meaning of the security requirements of the GDPR in processing of personal data. The General Data Protection Regulation and the relationship with complementary national provisions According to Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR, personal data shall treated in a lawful manner. For the processing to be considered lawful, it is necessary that legal basis, in that at least one of the conditions laid down in Article 6(1) is fulfilled. The provision of health care is a task of general interest interest referred to in Article 6(1)(e). In the health sector, the legal bases may also be legal obligation under Article 6(1)(c) and the exercise of official authority under Article 6(1)(e) updated. When it comes to the legal grounds of legal obligation, general interest or the exercise of official authority, Member States may, under Article 6.2, maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the provisions of the Regulation to national circumstances. National law may further define specific requirements for data processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair treatment. But there is not only a possibility to introduce national rules but also a obligation; Article 6(3) states that the ground for processing referred to in paragraph 1(c) and (e) shall be determined in accordance with Union law; or the national law of the Member States. The legal basis may also include specific provisions to adapt the application of the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation. Union law or Member States' national right must meet an objective of general interest and be proportionate to the legitimate objectives pursued. Article 9 states that the processing of special categories of personal data (so-called sensitive personal data) is prohibited. Sensitive personal data includes health data. Article 9(2) states the exceptions where sensitive personal data may still be processed. Article 9(2)(h) states that processing of sensitive personal data may take place if the processing is necessary for reasons related to, inter alia the provision of healthcare on the basis of Union law or national law of the Member States or by agreement with professionals in the health and provided that the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 3 are fulfilled. Article 9(3) requires regulated professional secrecy. This means that both the legal grounds of general interest, exercise of official authority and legal obligation as processing of sensitive personal data by virtue of the derogation in Article 9(2)(h) need supplementary rules. Additional national provisions In the case of Sweden, both the basis for the treatment and the specific conditions for processing personal data in the health and healthcare regulated in the Patient Data Act (2008:355), and the Patient Data Regulation (2008:360). In Chapter 1. 4 of the Patient Data Act states that the Act complements the General Data Protection Regulation. The purpose of the Patient Data Act is to ensure that information management in health and health care should be organised in such a way as to ensure patient safety and good quality and promotes cost efficiency. Its purpose is also to personal data shall be designed and otherwise processed in such a way that the the privacy of other data subjects is respected. In addition, documented personal data is processed and stored in such a way that unauthorised persons cannot access it them (Chapter 1, Section 2 of the Patient Data Act). According to Chapter 2. 6 of the Patient Data Act, a healthcare provider is a data controller for the processing of personal data carried out by the healthcare provider. In a region and a municipality is any authority which provides health services controller for the processing of personal data by the authority performs. The additional provisions of the Patient Data Act aim to addressing both privacy and patient safety. The legislator has Thus, the regulation strikes a balance in terms of how information should be processed to meet both patient safety requirements as the right to privacy in the processing of personal data. The National Board of Health and Welfare has issued regulations under the Patient Data Regulation and general guidance on record keeping and processing of personal data in health care (HSLF-FS 2016:40). The regulations constitute such supplementary rules, which shall apply to the processing by healthcare providers of personal data in health care. National rules complementing the requirements of the GDPR for security is contained in Chapters 4 and 6 of the Patient Data Act and Chapters 3 and 4 of the Data Protection Act. HSLF-FS 2016:40. Requirement to carry out needs and risk analysis According to chapter 4, section 2 of HSLF-FS 2016:40, the care provider must make a needs and risk analysis, before assigning permissions in the system. The need for an analysis of both needs and risks is clear from the preparatory work to the Patient Data Act, prop. 2007/08:126 p. 148-149, as follows. Authorisation for electronic access by staff to patient data shall be limited to what the official needs to perform his/her duties in the health and social services health care. This includes monitoring and changing or restricting authorisations according to as soon as changes in the duties of the individual officer so require. The provision corresponds in principle to Section 8 of the Health Care Register Act. The purpose of the provision is to inculcate the obligation for the responsible care provider to make active and individual based on analyses of the details of the information that different categories of staff and different types of activities need. But not only needs assessments. Risk analyses must also be carried out, taking into account the different types of risks such as may be associated with an excessive availability of certain types of data. Protected personal data marked as confidential, data on publicly known persons, data from certain clinics or medical specialties are examples of categories that may require specific risk assessments. Generally speaking, the more comprehensive an information system is, the greater the amount of different levels of authority must exist. Decisive for the decision on eligibility for e.g. different categories of health professionals to electronic access to data in medical records should be that the authorisation should be limited to what the manager needs for the purpose of good and safe patient care. A broader or coarser mesh assignment of access rights, even if it had merit from an efficiency point of view, should be considered as an unjustified dispersion of medical records within an organisation and as such should not accepted. Furthermore, data should be stored in different layers so that more sensitive data requires active choices or otherwise not as easily accessible to staff as less sensitive data. When it applies to staff involved in monitoring activities, producing statistics, central financial administration and similar activities that are not individually oriented, it should the majority of executives, it is sufficient to have access to information that can only be indirectly to individual patients. Electronic access to code keys, social security numbers and other data directly pointing to individual patients should in this area be able to be strongly limited to single persons. Internal confidentiality The provisions of Chapter 4 of the Patient Data Act concern internal confidentiality, i.e. say regulates how privacy is to be handled within a healthcare provider's activities and, in particular, the ability of employees to access personal data available electronically in a healthcare provider's organisation. Chapter 4, section 2 of the Patient Data Act states that the healthcare provider shall determine conditions for granting access rights to such data on patients who are fully or partially automated. Such authorisation shall limited to what is necessary for the individual to fulfil his or her tasks in health care. According to chapter 4, section 2 of HSLF-FS 2016:40, the healthcare provider shall be responsible for ensuring that each users are assigned an individual permission to access personal data. The decision of the healthcare provider to grant authorisation shall be preceded by a needs and risk analysis. Coherent record keeping Provisions in Chapter 6 of the Patient Data Act relate to coherent record keeping, which means that a healthcare provider - under the conditions set out in § 2 of the same chapter - may have direct access to personal data processed by other health care providers for purposes related to health care documentation. Access to information is provided by a healthcare provider making the information about a patient that the healthcare provider records about the patient available to other healthcare providers participating in the coherent record keeping (see prop. 2007/08:126 p. 247). From Chapter 6. 7 § Patient Data Act follows that the provisions of Chapter 4 also apply to for assigning access rights in the case of shared medical records. The requirement to the healthcare provider must carry out a needs and risk analysis before assigning permissions in the system, also applies in systems for coherent journal entries. Documentation of access (logs) Chapter 4, section 3 of the Patient Data Act states that a healthcare provider must ensure that access to such data on patients held in whole or in part automatically documented and systematically controlled. According to Chapter 4. 9 § HSLF-FS 2016:40, the care provider shall be responsible for 1. the documentation of the access (logs) shows which actions that have been taken with the data of a patient, 2. the logs indicate the care unit or care process the measures taken, 3. the logs show the time at which the measures were taken, 4. the identity of the user and the patient is shown in the logs. The Data Inspectorate's assessment Responsibility of the controller for security As described above, the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations give the responsibility for information management in healthcare, such as conduct a needs and risk analysis before assigning permissions in system happens. In the public health sector, there is no coincidence always the concept of the healthcare provider with the controller. Both the fundamental principles of Article 5 and Article 24(1) the General Data Protection Regulation, it is clear that it is the controller who shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the treatment is carried out in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation. The Data Protection Inspectorate notes that the General Data Protection Regulation, as EU regulation is directly applicable in Swedish law and that the regulation specify when additional regulation should or may be introduced nationally. There are for example, scope to regulate nationally who is controller within the meaning of Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation. It is however, it is not possible to give a different regulation concerning the responsibility of the controller to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the relation to the risk. This means that the National Board of Health and Welfare's that it is the care provider who should take certain measures, does not change that the responsibility to take appropriate security measures rests with the controller under the General Data Protection Regulation. Data Protection Authority can state that Karolinska University Hospital, in its capacity as controller, is responsible for ensuring that these measures are taken. As described above, Article 24(1) of the GDPR sets a general requirement for the controller to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures. The requirement aims to ensure that the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation, and that the controller should be able to demonstrate that the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation. The security of processing is more specifically regulated in Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation. Article 32(1) states that the appropriate measures shall be both technical and organisational and they shall ensure a level of security appropriate in in relation to the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons treatment. It is therefore necessary to identify the possible risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects and assesses the likelihood of the risks occurring and the severity if they do occur. What is appropriate varies not only in relation to the risks but also based on the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing. It has It is therefore important what personal data are processed, how many data involved, how many people process the data, etc. The health sector has a great need for information in its activities. The is therefore natural that the possibilities of digitalisation are exploited as much as possible possible in health care. Since the introduction of the Patient Data Act, a very extensive digitalisation has taken place in healthcare. Both the data collections size as the number of people sharing information with each other has increased significantly. At the same time, this increase places greater demands on the controller, as the assessment of what is an appropriate safety is affected by the extent of treatment. Moreover, sensitive personal data are involved. The data also concern people who are in a situation of dependency when they are in need of care. There is also often a lot of personal data about each of these persons and the data may be processed over time by very many people in healthcare. All this places great demands on the controller. The data processed must be protected both from outside actors business as against unauthorised access from within the business. It is clear of Article 32(2) that the controller, when assessing the appropriateness level of security, shall in particular take into account the risks of accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or unauthorised disclosure or access. In order to to know what is an unauthorised access, it must the controller is clear about what constitutes authorised access. Needs and risk analysis In chapter 4, section 2 of the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations (HSLF-FS 2016:40), which supplement the Patient Data Act, it is stated that the healthcare provider must make a needs and risk analysis before assigning permissions in the system. This means that national law requires an appropriate organisational measure to be be taken before assigning access rights to the medical record system. A needs and risk analysis should include an analysis of the needs and a analysis of the risks from a privacy perspective that may be associated with with an excessive allocation of access rights to patient data. Both the needs and the risks must be assessed on the basis of the data need to be addressed in the business, what processes are involved and the risks to the privacy of the individual. Risk assessments need to be made at the organisational level, where for example, a certain part of the activity or task may be more privacy-sensitive than another, but also on an individual level, if it is the question of special circumstances that need to be taken into account, such as that it concerns protected personal data, publicly known persons or otherwise particularly vulnerable persons. The size of the system also affects the risk assessment. The preparatory work for the Patient Data Act shows that the more comprehensive an information system is, the greater the variety of levels of authority there must be. (prop. 2007/08:126 p. 149). It is thus the question of a strategic analysis at the strategic level, which will provide a an authorisation structure adapted to the business and this must be maintained updated. In summary, the regulation requires that the risk analysis identifies different categories of data (e.g. health data), categories of data subjects (e.g. vulnerable natural persons and child), or the scope (e.g. number of personal data and data subjects) negative consequences for data subjects (e.g. injuries, significant social or economic disadvantage, deprivation of rights and freedoms) and how they affect the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons in processing of personal data. This applies both to internal confidentiality as in the case of coherent record keeping. The risk analysis shall also include specific risk assessments such as on the basis of the existence of protected personal data that is marked as confidential, information on publicly known persons, information from certain clinics or medical specialties (prop. 2007/08:126 p. 148149). The risk analysis shall also include an assessment of the likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects is and in any event determine whether it is a risk or a high risk (recital 76). It is thus through the needs and risk analysis that the the controller finds out who needs access, which data data to be accessed, at what times and in what formats context access is needed, while analysing the risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals that the processing may lead to. The result should then lead to the technical and organisational measures needed to ensure that no access other than that required by the the risk analysis shows to be justified shall be possible. In the absence of a needs and risk analysis for the allocation of competences in system, there is no basis for the controller to lawfully be able to assign the correct permissions to its users. The The controller is responsible for, and shall have control over, the personal data processing carried out within the framework of the activity. To assign users broad access to record systems, without this being based on on the basis of a needs and risk analysis, means that the controller does not have sufficient control over the processing of personal data carried out in system, nor can he demonstrate that he has the control required. When the Swedish Data Protection Authority has requested a needs and risk analysis Karolinska University Hospital referred to the policy document ""Decision on allocation of competences, guideline ""4 (guidelines on the allocation of competences) and stated that it is the respective patient area and functional area manager to carry out and document needs and risk analyses before assignment of permissions. According to Karolinska University Hospital when assigning authorisations, for example in the case of new recruitment, regularly an assessment of the employee's need for certification, even if the template for needs and risk analysis provided in the guideline is not completed regularly. Karolinska University Hospital could at the time of the inspection does not show a needs and risk analysis, but has subsequently stated that they had begun work to ensure that needs and risk analyses are carried out in the business. They have also submitted a documented ""needs and risks analysis"" for the functional area of Perioperative Medicine. As stated above, a needs and risk analysis should address both the needs and the risks are assessed on the basis of the data that need to be processed in operations, the processes involved and the risks to the integrity of the individual, both at organisational and individual level 4 ""Decision on the assignment of competences, guideline"" valid from 23 October 2018. level. It is therefore a question of a strategic analysis at a strategic level, which shall provide an authorisation structure adapted to the activities. It should should lead to instructions on the assignment of authorisations, but it is not the instructions to the permission assignor that is the analysis. At the time of the inspection, Karolinska University Hospital was unable to present any needs and risk analysis. The needs and risk analysis the risk analysis for the Perioperative Medicine function does not meet the data protection provisions' requirements for such an analysis under Chapter 4, Section 2 of HSLFFS 2016:40, as it constitutes a general description of tasks in TakeCare for some specific professional categories. The document contains no analysis of the data needed by employees to perform their tasks tasks. The document does not contain an analysis of the risks that may be associated with an excessive availability of different types of personal data. The Data Inspectorate further notes that the approach described in guidelines on the assignment of authorisations to analyse which authorisation to be assigned to an individual user is based on the existing eligibility profiles. These are created based on what users need be able to do with the tasks, for example reading or writing, and not from what information about the patient the individual user needs to have to carry out their work. The needs and risk analyses described in Karolinska University Hospital's guidelines on credentialing is not an analysis under the requirements of a needs and risk analysis according to data protection regulations. Karolinska The University Hospital has also failed to demonstrate that the work initiated following the previous audit in 2013 resulted in the implementation of a needs and risk analysis for TakeCare in accordance with the injunction. The Data Inspectorate can therefore conclude that Karolinska The allocation of authorisations by the University Hospital has not been preceded by a necessary needs and risk analysis. Granting of access rights to personal data concerning wait As explained above, a healthcare provider may have a legitimate interest in having extensive processing of personal health data. Notwithstanding this access to personal data of patients be limited to what is necessary for the individual to perform his/her duties. With regard to the granting of authorisation for electronic access under Chapter 4. 2 § and 6 chap. 7 § Patient Data Act, it is clear from the preparatory work, prop. 2007/08:126 pp. 148-149, including that there should be different categories of access in the health record system and that the access limited to what the user needs to provide the patient with a good and safe care. It is also stated that ""a broader or more coarse-meshed allocation of competences should be considered as an unjustified proliferation of medical records within a business and as such should not be accepted."" In health care, the person who needs the data in his or her work who may be authorised to access them. This applies both within a care providers as between care providers. It is, as already mentioned, through the needs and risks analysis that the controller finds out who who needs access, what data the access should cover, at what when and in what contexts access is needed, and at the same time analyses the risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals that treatment may lead to. The result should then lead to the technical and organisational measures necessary to ensure that no allocation of access provides wider access possibilities than that provided by the the risk analysis shows is justified. An important organisational measure is to provide instructions to those authorised to grant authorisations on how to do so and what should be taken into account so that, with the needs and risk analysis as a basis, will be a correct assignment of authority in each case. In addition to Karolinska University Hospital's guideline for allocation of permissions, there is also a guidance document ""Access to patient records, guideline"" (access guidelines), which will apply from 17 August 2018.5 However, the guidelines provide only a general description of the regulatory framework and describes the conditions for the assignment of permissions respectively for to access the care documentation in TakeCare in different situations. The Data Inspectorate notes that although each user has de facto assigned an individual permission, the permissions assigned have not The guideline ""access to patient records, guideline"" is established by the head physician in the area quality and patient safety, and lawyers have participated in the development area. 5 restricted in a way that ensures that the user does not have access to more personal data of patients or personal data about more patients than he needs to do his job. The allocated permissions means that the user has access to virtually all personal data of patients in TakeCare. This is because there are only two eligibility profiles for nurses and doctors respectively, and where the only that distinguishes the authorization profiles is that one the nursing authorisation has automated login to the care unit the staff belongs to and one medical authority has access to a so-called acute care. The restriction that has otherwise emerged regarding access to personal data in the medical record system refers to so-called protected devices. Against this background, the Data Inspectorate considers that, since the allocation of permissions was not preceded by the necessary needs and risk analysis, not there were conditions to restrict assigned permissions or there was support to determine what is justified access for executives at Karolinska University Hospital. The fact that the allocation of permissions has not been preceded by a needs and risk analysis means that Karolinska University Hospital has not analysed the users' need for access to the data, the risks associated with this access and thus not identified what access possibilities justified to users on the basis of such an analysis. Karolinska The university hospital has thus not taken appropriate organisational measures, in accordance with Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation, to limit users' access to personal data of patients in the medical record system. This in turn has meant that there has been a risk of unauthorised access and unwarranted dissemination of personal data in the context of the internal confidentiality, on the one hand, and in the context of the single file management, on the other. The number of users at Karolinska University Hospital is close to 11 000 and TakeCare contains personal data of about 3 million patients, of which about 2 million have been patients at Karolinska University Hospital. In light of the above, the Swedish Data Protection Authority can conclude that Karolinska University Hospital has processed personal data in breach of Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32(1) and (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation by Karolinska University Hospital has not restricted users permissions for access to the TakeCare medical record system to what is needed for the user to perform his/her tasks within the health care pursuant to Chapter 4, Section 2 and Chapter 6. 7 § of the Patient Data Act and 4 Chapter 2 § HSLF-FS 2016:40. This means that Karolinska University Hospital has not taken the measures necessary to ensure and, in accordance with Article 5.2 of the General Data Protection Regulation, be able to demonstrate adequate security for personal data. Documentation of access in logs The Data Inspectorate notes that the logs in TakeCare show that information about the specific patient, which user has opened the the medical record, actions taken, which medical record has been opened, the period of time the user has been in, all openings of the medical record made on that patient during the selected time period and the time and date of the last opening. According to the Data Inspectorate assessment, this is consistent with the requirements for documentation of accesses in the logs set out in the regulations of the National Board of Health and Welfare. Choice of intervention Legal regulation If there has been a breach of the General Data Protection Regulation The Data Protection Inspectorate has a number of remedial powers at its disposal under Article 58.2 a - j of the GDPR. The supervisory authority may, inter alia order the controller to ensure that the processing is carried out in in accordance with the Regulation and, if necessary, in a specific manner and within a specific period. It follows from Article 58(2) of the GDPR that the Data Protection Inspectorate in in accordance with Article 83 shall impose penalties in addition to, or instead of, other corrective measures referred to in Article 58(2), depending on the circumstances of each case. For public authorities, Article 83(7) of the GDPR allows national rules specify that administrative penalties may be imposed on public authorities. According to Chapter 6, Section 2 of the Data Protection Act, penalties may be imposed for authorities, but not exceeding SEK 5 000 000 or SEK 10 000 000 depending on whether the infringement concerns articles covered by Article 83(4) or 83.5 of the GDPR. Article 83(2) sets out the factors to be taken into account in determining whether a administrative penalty should be imposed, but also what should affect the amount of the penalty. Central to the assessment of the seriousness of the infringement is its nature, severity and duration. About in the case of a minor infringement, the supervisory authority may, pursuant to recital 148 of the General Data Protection Regulation, issue a reprimand instead of imposing a penalty fee. Injunction As mentioned, the health sector has a great need for information in its activities and in recent years a very extensive digitalisation occurred in the health care sector. Both the size of the data collections and the number of sharing information with each other has increased significantly. This increases the demands on the controller, since the assessment of what is an appropriate safety is affected by the extent of treatment. In health care, this means even greater responsibility for the controller to protect the data from unauthorised access, including by having a fine-grained allocation of competences. The is therefore essential that there is a real analysis of the needs from different businesses and different executives. It is equally important that there is a actual analysis of the risks that may arise from a privacy perspective in the case of an excessive allocation of access rights. Based on this analysis then the individual officer's access shall be restricted. This eligibility must then be monitored and modified or restricted as appropriate that changes in the duties of the individual post holder result in reason for it. The Data Inspectorate's supervision has shown that Karolinska University Hospital does not has taken appropriate security measures to provide protection to personal data in the medical record system by Karolinska The University Hospital, as data controller, failed to comply with the requirements set out in the Patient Data Act and the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations. Karolinska The University Hospital has thereby failed to comply with the requirements of Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32(1) and (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation. The failure includes both the internal secrecy according to chapter 4 of the Patient Data Act and the coherent record keeping according to Chapter 6 of the Patient Data Act. The Data Inspectorate therefore orders, on the basis of 58.2(d) of the the General Data Protection Regulation, Karolinska University Hospital to ensure that the necessary needs and risk analysis for the TakeCare medical record system is carried out within the framework of both internal secrecy and coherent record keeping. The needs and risk analysis must be documented. Karolinska University Hospital shall, with the support of the needs and the risk analysis, assign each user individual access rights to personal data limited to what is necessary for the the individual is able to carry out his or her duties in the health care sector. Penalty fee The Data Protection Inspectorate notes that the infringements basically concern Karolinska University Hospital's obligation to take appropriate security measures to provide protection to personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation. In this case, it is a question of very large data collections with sensitive personal data and wide-ranging permissions. The healthcare provider needs with need to have extensive processing of data on individual health. However, it must not be unrestricted but must be based on what individuals employees need to perform their tasks. Data Protection Inspectorate notes that the data in question involves direct identification of the individual by name, contact details and personal identity number, health data, but that it may also concern other private information on, for example, family circumstances, sexual life and lifestyle. Patient are dependent on receiving care and are therefore in a vulnerable situation. Data the nature, extent and dependency of patients gives healthcare providers a particular responsibility to ensure patients' rights to adequate protection of their personal data. Further aggravating circumstances are that the treatment of patient data in the main record system is at the core of a healthcare provider's activities, that the treatment covers many patients and the possibility of access concerns a large proportion of the employees. around 2 000 000 patients under the internal confidentiality regime and around 1 000 000 additional patients under the coherent record keeping. There are only six so-called protected units where the data is not accessible to users outside these devices. The Data Inspectorate can also state that Karolinska The University Hospital did not comply with the Data Inspectorate's previous injunction from of 26 August 2013 to carry out a needs and risk analysis that the basis for the allocation of authorisations according to the then requirement in Chapter 2. 6 § second paragraph second sentence SOSFS 2008:14, which corresponds to the current provision in Chapter 4, Section 2 of HSLF-FS 2016:40. This is an aggravating circumstance, pursuant to Article 83(2)(e) of the GDPR. The deficiencies now identified have thus been known to Karolinska the University Hospital for several years, which means that the action intentional and therefore considered more serious. In determining the gravity of the infringements, it can also be noted that the infringements also include the fundamental principles of Article 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation, which belongs to the categories of more serious infringements which may give rise to a higher penalty under Article 83(5) of the General Data Protection Regulation. These factors taken together mean that the infringements are not to be assessed as minor infringements without infringements that should lead to a administrative penalty. The Data Protection Inspectorate considers that these infringements are closely related to each other. This assessment is based on the fact that the needs and risks analysis should be the basis for the allocation of the permissions. The Swedish Data Protection Authority therefore considers that these infringements are so closely linked that they constitute linked processing operations within the meaning of Article 83(3) of the the General Data Protection Regulation. The Data Protection Inspectorate therefore determines a common penalties for these infringements. The administrative penalty shall be effective, proportionate and deterrent. This means that the amount should be determined in such a way that the administrative penalty leads to correction, that it provides a preventive effect, and that it is proportionate to both the current infringements as to the ability of the supervised entity to pay. The maximum amount of the fine in this case is SEK 10 million pursuant to Chapter 6, Section 2 of the Act (2018:218) with supplementary provisions to the EU Data Protection Regulation. In view of the seriousness of the infringements and the fact that the administrative the penalty shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive the Data Protection Inspectorate determines the administrative penalty fee for Karolinska University Hospital to SEK 4 000 000 (four million).

Section 2 of the National Board of Health and Welfare regulations and general guidelines (HSLF-FS 2016: 40) on record keeping and processing of personal data in health care. This means that Sahlgrenska University Hospital has not taken appropriate organizational measures to ensure and be able to show that the processing of personal data has a security that is appropriate in relation to the risks. 2. Sahlgrenska University Hospital does not restrict users authorizations for access to the Melior and National journal systems patient overview to what is only needed for the user to be able to fulfill their duties in health care according to ch. 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 § 2 HSLF- FS 2016: 40. This means that Sahlgrenska University Hospital does not has taken steps to ensure and be able to show one appropriate security for personal data. 3. Sahlgrenska University Hospital does not have documentation in Melior of access (logs) where it is stated which measures have been taken with information about a patient according to ch. 4 Section 3 of the Patient Data Act and 4 Cape. § 9 (item 1) HSLF-FS 2016: 40. This means that Sahlgrenska 1 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on protection for natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free flow of such information and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Regulation). Page 4 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 4 (34) The University Hospital has not taken appropriate organizational measures measures to be able to ensure and be able to show that the treatment of the personal data has a security that is appropriate in relation to the risks. The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of Articles 58 (2) and 83 of the the Protection Ordinance and Chapter 6 § 2 of the law (2018: 218) with additional provisions to the EU Data Protection Regulation that Sahlgrenska University Hospital, for violation of Article 5 (1) (f) and 5.2 and Article 32 (1) and (2) of the Data Protection Regulation, shall pay a administrative penalty fee of 3,500,000 (three million five hundred thousand crowns. The Data Inspectorate submits pursuant to Article 58 (2) (d) data protection ordinance Sahlgrenska University Hospital that 1. ensure that the required needs and risk analysis is carried out and documented for the journal systems Melior and Nationell patient overview and that thereafter, with the support of needs and risk analysis, each user is assigned individual authority for access to personal data limited to what is needed for the individual to be able to fulfill his or her duties in healthcare, in accordance with Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32.1 and 32.2 of the Data Protection Ordinance, Chapter 4 § 2 and ch. 6 § 7 the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. 2. document in the journal system Melior's logs so that it appears there what measures have been taken with personal data about a patient, i in accordance with Article 32 of the Data Protection Ordinance, Chapter 4 § 3 the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 § 9 (item 1) HSLF-FS 2016: 40. Report on the supervisory matter The Data Inspectorate initiated supervision by letter on 22 March 2019 and has on site on 23 April 2019 reviewed the Board of Directors of Sahlgrenska University Hospital (hereinafter referred to as Sahlgrenska University Hospital) decisions on the allocation of authorizations have been preceded by a need and risk analysis. The review has also included how Sahlgrenska Page 5 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 5 (34) The University Hospital has been granted authorizations for access to the main journal system Melior and NPÖ, and what access possibilities they have granted the privileges provide within the framework of internal confidentiality according to ch. 4 the Patient Data Act, as the coherent record keeping according to Chapter 6 patient data law. In addition to this, the Data Inspectorate has examined which one documentation of access (logs) contained in the journal systems. The Data Inspectorate has only examined users' access to the journal system, i.e. what care documentation the user can actually take part of and read. The supervision has not included which functions were included in the competence, ie. what the user can actually do in the journal system (eg issuing prescriptions, writing referrals, etc.). Previous review of needs and risk analysis The Data Inspectorate has previously carried out an inspection regarding Sahlgrenska The University Hospital had carried out a documented needs and risk analysis according to ch. Section 6, second paragraph, second sentence of the National Board of Health and Welfare regulations Information management and record keeping in health care (SOSFS 2008: 14). Of the Data Inspectorate's decision with registration number 1607-2013, announced on March 27, 2015, it appears that Sahlgrenska University Hospital did not meet the requirement to carry out a needs and risk analysis according to said regulations, and was therefore ordered to implement such a the main journal system. What has emerged in the case Sahlgrenska University Hospital has mainly stated the following. Personal data manager Sahlgrenska University Hospital has stated that the Board of Sahlgrenska The University Hospital is responsible for the processing of personal data personal data that Sahlgrenska University Hospital performs in the main journal system Melior. Sahlgrenska University Hospital also has stated that the National Patient Overview (NPÖ) is only a reading view that presents information from connected systems, and that no information stored in NPÖ. Sahlgrenska University Hospital is not personal data controller for information displayed in NPÖ. Page 6 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 6 (34) Journal system Sahlgrenska University Hospital has stated that they have been using since 1998 of the main journal system Melior within the framework of internal confidentiality. Everything is seen as internal secrecy within the framework of the Västra Götaland region. Since May 6, 2014, Melior in the Västra Götaland region consists of one single database (GEM), instead of the previous 27. It used to be possible access other units' care documentation but it was significantly more cumbersome, which meant that employees were reluctant to read records of other units. The current division of units is the same as before but now it is easier to access others units records. According to data provided by Sahlgrenska University Hospital 896,401 patients recorded in Melior at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. The number of employees at Sahlgrenska The University Hospital is 16,731, and the number of active accounts in Melior is 24 638 st. Sahlgrenska University Hospital has stated that the reason for that the number of active accounts is greater than the number of employees is that Västra The Götaland region is an internal privacy zone, and that Sahlgrenska The University Hospital collaborates with other administrations within Västra The Götaland region, where employees need access to patient information at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Sahlgrenska University Hospital is not part of a cohesive system record keeping through Melior, but is included in cohesive record keeping through the NPÖ system. Internal secrecy Needs and risk analysis At the time of the inspection, Sahlgrenska University Hospital stated in essentially the following. When a new employee is hired, a needs analysis is first made, consisting of one assessment of which systems the employee needs access to. The assessment is made in two steps: 1) which assignment the person has and 2) which systems the person needs to have access to in order to perform their work / assignment. Due to a limitation in the system no one is done Page 7 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 7 (34) assessment of which tasks in Melior the employee should be able to take part in of. Then a risk analysis is made which consists of an assessment at the individual level of if the person to be assigned eligibility will follow the guidelines for to take part in information in Melior. If this is not the case, the person should not normally employed. At the time of inspection, Sahlgrenska University Hospital cannot present an analysis for people who are employed and it is unclear whether it is documented. Sahlgrenska University Hospital has comments on the inspection report that was received by the Swedish Data Inspectorate on 27 June 2019 stated that Sahlgrenska University Hospital in September 2011 carried out a comprehensive risk analysis, Availability of the operation of the electronic the patient record Melior, regarding patient safety, information security and technical safety. The starting point for the risk analysis at that time was that simplify access to patient data between the different devices within the hospital when the National Board of Health and Welfare considered the division into different databases which was present at the time entailed a patient safety risk. 27 databases merged into a hospital-wide database and the general role which is assigned to all staff in need of access to the patient record was introduced. Previous review of needs and risk analysis Due to the Data Inspectorate's previous review, Sahlgrenska has The University Hospital has submitted a number of documents, including a risk and vulnerability analysis and a so-called simplified needs and risk analysis with the title Needs and risk analysis when allocating individual eligibility to journal systems , which are said to have been developed in the spring of 2019, to show how Sahlgrenska University Hospital has acted after the inspection earlier decision. On 13 September 2019, Sahlgrenska University Hospital was also included the document Needs and risk analysis when allocating authorization , of which it states that “In healthcare, the patient's life and health are more important than integrity which means that accessibility and accuracy outweigh confidentiality from a patient safety perspective. IN the patient record system (Melior), the employee must make an active choice for Page 8 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 8 (34) to be able to access patient information from other care units / processes. We makes the assessment that that function is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of confidentiality. We believe it is in accordance with HSLF-FS 2016: 40. Sahlgrenska University Hospital accepts the risk of confidentiality is not as high a priority as accuracy and availability until Sahlgrenska University Hospital has a technical or organizational opportunity to prioritize confidentiality ”. Authorization of access to personal data about patients Sahlgrenska University Hospital has mainly stated the following. There are two different roles when it comes to assigning reading permissions to Melior; a general role assigned to all health and medical staff healthcare, and a so-called operational role. When it comes to the general role, there are two different variants; a ""general"" and a ""general including emergency access"". All employees within health care has been assigned a general role - with or without emergency access. The difference between the different variants is that the variant “generally inclusive emergency access ”is assigned to physicians and nurses, and involves the user have the opportunity to open blocked journals outside their own the activity, in the event that the patient is unable to give his consent. The ""general"" variant is assigned to other care staff and secretaries, if desired say the users who are not doctors or nurses but who should have eligibility for Melior. With the general role, the employee has access to all units care documentation, with the exception of the clinical genetics unit which is not included in the general authorizations. There are no more restrictions on access in Melior, apart from healthcare documentation such as the patient himself has blocked. The business role provides access to blocked information regarding a certain unit. An employee must have an assignment to be assigned the business role and can only be assigned that role regarding that unit Page 9 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 9 (34) to which the employee belongs. Every business has such a business role and in total the number of such operational roles amounts to about 60-70. Active choices During the inspection, Sahlgrenska University Hospital has shown how the permissions appear in the system, and stated, among other things, the following. When an employee logs in to Melior, he is directed to the unit that the employee belongs to. When the employee is logged in, there are six tabs in it the right edge that gives access to different parts of the journal that the employee has chosen to take part in. As a starting point, only the journal is displayed at the device that has been selected at login, but through active selections can the employee has access to other units' records. If an employee is logged in as a nurse, it is initially only visible nurses' medical records. However, the employee can get access to other professional categories' journal entries by checking boxes for different occupational categories. There is also the opportunity to check a single box covering all occupational categories, thereby gaining a share of journal entries of all occupational categories. Coherent record keeping Sahlgrenska University Hospital participates in systems for cohesion record keeping through NPÖ, and has mainly stated the following. Needs and risk analysis Sahlgrenska University Hospital has not done any needs and risk analysis before granting authorization in NPÖ. Authorization of access to personal data about patients The patient must be enrolled at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Melior so that the employee can use NPÖ. Access to NPÖ is given to healthcare professionals, especially doctors and nurses, and an employee assignment is required to obtain such authorization. As In principle, only doctors and nurses have access to NPÖ, but other categories can be accessed upon their own application competence. In such cases, the employee may apply for an employee assignment coherent record keeping. The allocation of the authorizations is based on Page 10 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 1 0 (34) needs and fewer employees have access to NPÖ than to Melior. For example assistant nurses need to be able to note in the journal in Melior but they does not need to have access to NPÖ. Those who are eligible for NPÖ can see all care documentation available there, but active choices are required. Documentation of access (logs) Sahlgrenska University Hospital has stated the following. The documentation that is displayed when removing the access logs in Melior is information about the patient, which user has opened the record, which part of the journal that has been opened and the time and date of the most recent the opening. It is not clear at which care unit the measures were taken or which measures which the user has specifically taken. Sahlgrenska University Hospital has stated that information about which unit the user is employed on can controlled by a search on where the user is employed. Different logs must then be combined with each other. Grounds for the decision Applicable rules The Data Protection Regulation is the primary source of law The Data Protection Regulation, often abbreviated GDPR, was introduced on 25 May 2018 and is the primary legal regulation in the processing of personal data. This also applies to health care. The basic principles for the processing of personal data are set out in Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation. A basic principle is the requirement security pursuant to Article 5 (1) (f), which states that personal data shall be processed in a way that ensures adequate security for personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unauthorized treatment and against loss, destruction or damage by accident, using appropriate technical or organizational measures. Page 11 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 1 1 (34) Article 5 (2) states the so-called liability, ie. that it personal data controllers must be responsible for and be able to show that the basic the principles set out in paragraph 1 are complied with. Article 24 deals with the responsibility of the controller. Of Article 24 (1) it appears that the person responsible for personal data is responsible for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate that the processing is performed in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. The measures shall carried out taking into account the nature, scope, context of the treatment and purposes and the risks, of varying degrees of probability and severity, for freedoms and rights of natural persons. The measures must be reviewed and updated if necessary. Article 32 regulates the security associated with the processing. According to paragraph 1 the personal data controller and the personal data assistant shall take into account of the latest developments, implementation costs and treatment nature, scope, context and purpose as well as the risks, of varying probability and seriousness, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of safety appropriate to the risk (…). According to paragraph 2, when assessing the appropriate level of safety, special consideration is given to the risks which the treatment entails, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or to unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data transferred, stored or otherwise processed. Recital 75 states that in assessing the risk to natural persons rights and freedoms, various factors must be taken into account. Among other things mentioned personal data covered by professional secrecy, health data or sexual life, if the processing of personal data concerning vulnerable physical persons takes place persons, especially children, or if the treatment involves a large number personal data and applies to a large number of registered persons. Furthermore, it follows from recital 76 that the probable and serious risk of it data subjects' rights and freedoms should be determined on the basis of processing nature, scope, context and purpose. The risk should be evaluated on on the basis of an objective assessment, which determines whether the data processing involves a risk or a high risk. Page 12 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 1 2 (34) Recitals 39 and 83 also contain writings that provide guidance on it the meaning of the Data Protection Regulation's requirements for security in Processing of personal data. The Data Protection Regulation and the relationship with complementary national provisions According to Article 5 (1) (a) of the Data Protection Regulation, personal data must: treated in a lawful manner. In order for the treatment to be considered legal, it is required legal basis by fulfilling at least one of the conditions of Article 6 (1). The provision of health care is one such task of general interest referred to in Article 6 (1) (e). In health care, the legal bases can also be legal obligation in Article 6 (1) (c) and the exercise of authority under Article 6 (1) (e) updated. When it comes to the legal bases legal obligation, in general interest or exercise of authority by the Member States, in accordance with Article 6.2, maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the provisions of the Regulation to national circumstances. National law may specify specific requirements for the processing of data and other measures to ensure legal and fair treatment. But there is not only one possibility to introduce national rules but also one duty; Article 6 (3) states that the basis for the treatment referred to in paragraph 1 (c) and (e) shall be determined in accordance with Union law or national law of the Member States. The legal basis may also include specific provision to adapt the application of the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation. Union law or the national law of the Member States law must fulfill an objective of general interest and be proportionate to it legitimate goals pursued. Article 9 states that the treatment of specific categories of personal data ( so-called sensitive personal data) is prohibited. Sensitive personal data includes data on health. Article 9 (2) states except when sensitive personal data may still be processed. Article 9 (2) (h) states that the processing of sensitive personal data may be repeated the treatment is necessary for reasons related to, among other things the provision of health care on the basis of Union law or Page 13 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 1 3 (34) national law of the Member States or in accordance with agreements with professionals in the field of health and provided that the conditions and protective measures referred to in paragraph 3 are met. Article 9 (3) requires regulated secrecy. This means that both the legal bases of general interest, exercise of authority and legal obligation in the treatment of the vulnerable personal data under the exemption in Article 9 (2) (h) supplementary rules. Supplementary national regulations In the case of Sweden, both the basis for the treatment and those special conditions for the processing of personal data in the field of health and healthcare regulated in the Patient Data Act (2008: 355), and the Patient Data Ordinance (2008: 360). I 1 kap. Section 4 of the Patient Data Act states that the law complements the data protection regulation. The purpose of the Patient Data Act is to provide information in health and healthcare must be organized so as to meet patient safety and good quality and promotes cost efficiency. Its purpose is also to personal data shall be designed and otherwise processed so that patients and the privacy of other data subjects is respected. In addition, must be documented personal data is handled and stored so that unauthorized persons do not have access to it them (Chapter 1, Section 2 of the Patient Data Act). According to ch. Section 6 of the Patient Data Act is a care provider responsible for personal data for the processing of personal data carried out by the care provider. In a region and one municipality is each authority that conducts health and medical care personal data controller for the processing of personal data that the authority performs. The supplementary provisions in the Patient Data Act aim to: take care of both privacy protection and patient safety. The legislator has thus through the regulation made a balance as to how the information must be processed to meet both the requirements for patient safety as the right to privacy in the processing of personal data. The National Board of Health and Welfare has, with the support of the Patient Data Ordinance, issued regulations and general advice on record keeping and processing of personal data in health care (HSLF-FS 2016: 40). The regulations constitute such Page 14 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 1 4 (34) supplementary rules, to be applied in the care provider's treatment of personal data in health care. National provisions supplementing the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation safety can be found in Chapters 4 and 6. the Patient Data Act and Chapters 3 and 4 HSLF-FS 2016: 40. Requirement to do needs and risk analysis According to ch. 4, the care provider must § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40 make a needs and risk analysis, before the allocation of authorizations in the system takes place. That the analysis requires both the needs and the risks is clear from the preparatory work to the Patient Data Act, prop. 2007/08: 126 pp. 148-149, as follows. Authorization for staff's electronic access to patient information shall be limited to what the executive needs to be able to perform his duties in health and healthcare. This includes that authorizations must be followed up and changed or restricted accordingly hand as changes in the tasks of the individual executive give rise to it. The provision corresponds in principle to section 8 of the Health Care Register Act. The purpose of the provision is to imprint the obligation of the responsible caregiver to make active and individual eligibility assignments based on analyzes of which details are different staff categories and different types of activities need. But it's not just needed needs analyzes. Risk analyzes must also be done where different types of risks are taken into account, such as may be associated with an overly availability of certain types of information. Protected personal data that is classified, information about publicly known persons, data from certain clinics or medical specialties are examples of categories such as may require special risk assessments. In general, it can be said that the more comprehensive an information system is, the greater the amount there must be different levels of authorization. Decisive for decisions on eligibility for e.g. various categories of healthcare professionals for electronic access to data in patient records should be that the authority should be limited to what the executive needs for the purpose a good and safe patient care. A more extensive or coarse-meshed competence allocation should - even if it has points from the point of view of efficiency - is considered an unjustified dissemination of journal information within a business and should as such not accepted. Furthermore, data should be stored in different layers so that more sensitive data require active choices or otherwise not as easily accessible to staff as less sensitive tasks. When it applies to personnel who work with business follow-up, statistics production, central financial administration and similar activities that are not individual-oriented, it should be most executives suffice with access to information that can only be indirectly derived to individual patients. Electronic access to code keys, social security numbers and others data that directly point out individual patients should be able to be strong in this area limited to individuals. Page 15 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 1 5 (34) Internal secrecy The provisions in ch. 4 The Patient Data Act concerns internal confidentiality, ie. regulates how privacy protection is to be handled within a care provider's business and especially employees' opportunities to prepare for personal data that is electronically available in a healthcare provider organisation. It appears from ch. Section 2 of the Patient Data Act stipulates that the care provider must decide conditions for granting access to such data patients who are fully or partially automated. Such authorization shall limited to what is needed for the individual to be able to fulfill theirs tasks in health care. According to ch. 4 § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40, the care provider shall be responsible for each users are assigned an individual privilege to access personal data. The caregiver's decision on the allocation of eligibility shall preceded by a needs and risk analysis. Coherent record keeping The provisions in ch. 6 the Patient Data Act concerns cohesive record keeping, which means that a care provider - under the conditions specified in § 2 of the same chapter - may have direct access to personal data processed by others caregivers for purposes related to care documentation. The access to information is provided by a healthcare provider making the information about a patient which the care provider registers if the patient is available to other care providers who participate in the coherent record keeping (see Bill 2007/08: 126 p. 247). Of ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act follows that the provisions in Chapter 4 § 2 also applies to authorization allocation for unified record keeping. The requirement of that the care provider must perform a needs and risk analysis before allocating permissions in the system take place, also applies in systems for cohesion record keeping. Documentation of access (logs) Of ch. 4 Section 3 of the Patient Data Act states that a care provider must ensure that access to such data on patients kept in whole or in part automatically documented and systematically checked. According to ch. 4 Section 9 HSLF-FS 2016: 40, the care provider shall be responsible for that Page 16 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 1 6 (34) 1. it appears from the documentation of the access (logs) which measures taken with information on a patient, 2. it appears from the logs at which care unit or care process measures have been taken, 3. the logs indicate the time at which the measures were taken; 4. the identity of the user and the patient is stated in the logs. The Data Inspectorate's assessment Personal data controller's responsibility for security As described above, the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations give the caregiver one responsibility for information management in healthcare, such as that carry out a needs and risk analysis before assigning authorizations in the system happens. In public health care does not coincide always the concept of caregiver with the personal data controller. Of both the basic principles of Article 5 and Article 24 (1) the Data Protection Ordinance, it appears that it is the person responsible for personal data which shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to: ensure and be able to demonstrate that the treatment is carried out in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate can state that the Data Protection Ordinance in its capacity as EU regulation is directly applicable in Swedish law and that in the regulation indicates when supplementary regulation is or may be introduced nationally. There is for example, space to nationally regulate who is data controller in accordance with Article 4 of the Data Protection Regulation. It is however, it is not possible to give deviating regulation regarding it the personal data controller's responsibility to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security in relation to the risk. This means that the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations state that it is the caregiver who must take certain measures, does not change that the responsibility to take appropriate security measures rests with it personal data controller according to the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate can state that Sahlgrenska University Hospital, in its capacity as responsible for personal data, is responsible for taking these measures. As previously described, Article 24 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation provides a general requirement for the personal data controller to take appropriate technical Page 17 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 1 7 (34) and organizational measures. The requirement is partly to ensure that the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with the Data Protection Ordinance, and that the data controller must be able to demonstrate that the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. The safety associated with the treatment is regulated more specifically in the articles 5.1 f and 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. Article 32 (1) states that the appropriate measures shall be both technical and organizational and they must ensure a level of security that is appropriate in in relation to the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons which the treatment entails. It is therefore necessary to identify the possible ones the risks to the data subjects' rights and freedoms and assess the probability of the risks occurring and the severity if they occur. What is appropriate varies not only in relation to the risks but also based on the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment. It has thus the significance of what personal data is processed, how many data, it is a question of how many people process the data, etc. The health service has a great need for information in its operations. The It is therefore natural that the possibilities of digitalisation are utilized as much as possible in healthcare. Since the Patient Data Act was introduced, a lot extensive digitization has taken place in healthcare. Both the data collections size as the number of people sharing information with each other has increased substantially. At the same time, this increase means that the demands on it increase personal data controller, as the assessment of what is an appropriate safety is affected by the extent of the treatment. It is also a question of sensitive personal data. The information concerns people who are in a situation of dependence when they are in need of care. It is also often a question of a lot of personal information about each of these people and the data may over time be processed by very many people in healthcare. All in all, this places great demands on it personal data controllers. The data processed must be protected from outside actors as well the business as against unauthorized access from within the business. It appears of Article 32 (2) that the data controller, in assessing the appropriate Page 18 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 1 8 (34) level of safety, in particular shall take into account the risks of unintentional or illegal destruction, loss or unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access. In order to be able to know what is an unauthorized access it must personal data controllers must be clear about what is an authorized access. Needs and risk analysis I 4 kap. Section 2 of the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations (HSLF-FS 2016: 40) which supplement In the Patient Data Act, it is stated that the care provider must make a needs and risk analysis before the allocation of authorizations in the system takes place. This means that national law prescribes requirements for an appropriate organizational measure that shall: taken before the allocation of authorizations to journal systems takes place. A needs and risk analysis must include an analysis of the needs and a analysis of the risks from an integrity perspective that may be associated with an overly allotment of access to personal data about patients. Both the needs and the risks must be assessed on the basis of them tasks that need to be processed in the business, what processes it is the question of whether and what risks to the privacy of the individual exist. The assessments of the risks need to be made on the basis of organizational level, there for example, a certain business part or task may be more privacy sensitive than another, but also based on the individual level, if it is the issue of special circumstances that need to be taken into account, such as that it is a question of protected personal data, publicly known persons or otherwise particularly vulnerable persons. The size of the system also affects the risk assessment. The preparatory work for the Patient Data Act shows that the more comprehensive an information system is, the greater the variety eligibility levels must exist. (Prop. 2007/08: 126 p. 149). It is thus the question of a strategic analysis at the strategic level, which should provide one authorization structure that is adapted to the business and this must be maintained updated. In summary, the regulation requires that the risk analysis identifies • different categories of data (eg health data), Categories of data subjects (eg vulnerable natural persons and children), or • the scope (eg number of personal data and registered) Page 19 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 1 9 (34) • negative consequences for data subjects (eg injuries, significant social or economic disadvantage, deprivation of rights and freedoms), and how they affect the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons Processing of personal data. This applies both within internal secrecy as in coherent record keeping. The risk analysis must also include special risk assessments, for example based on whether there is protected personal data that is classified, information on public figures, information from certain clinics or medical specialties (Bill 2007/08: 126 p. 148- 149). The risk analysis must also include an assessment of how probable and serious the risk to the data subjects' rights and freedoms is and in any case determined whether it is a risk or a high risk (recital 76). It is thus through the needs and risk analysis that it personal data controller finds out who needs access, which information the accessibility shall include, at what times and at what context access is needed, while analyzing the risks to it the freedoms and rights of the individual that the treatment may lead to. The result should then lead to the technical and organizational measures needed to ensure that no access other than that of need and the risk analysis shows that it should be justified. When a needs and risk analysis is missing prior to the allocation of qualifications in system, lacks the basis for the personal data controller on a legal be able to assign their users a correct authorization. The the data controller is responsible for, and shall have control over, the personal data processing that takes place within the framework of the business. To assign users one upon access to journal system, without this being founded on a performed needs and risk analysis, means that the person responsible for personal data does not have sufficient control over the personal data processing that takes place in the journal system and also can not show that he has the control that required. Page 20 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 2 0 (34) Sahlgrenska University Hospital's process for needs and risk analysis Sahlgrenska University Hospital has within the framework of the supervisory matter referred to three different processes or documents that are said to constitute one needs and risk analysis. Regarding the process that Sahlgrenska The university hospital referred to at the time of the inspection passed this partly in an assessment of which assignments the person has and which systems the person needs to have access to, partly in an assessment at the individual level of whether the employee to be hired seemed inclined to take part in tasks in the medical record system in violation of current guidelines. The Data Inspectorate can state that Sahlgrenska University Hospital does not has carried out an analysis concerning the business, various processes and staff categories' need to process data. What is described is instead, only an assessment of what systems an employee needs to have access to. The risk analysis described by Sahlgrenska University Hospital is about one risk assessment other than that referred to in the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations. IN the needs and risk analysis, risks to the individual's integrity must be identified. As is clear from the preparatory work for the Patient Data Act, certain information may be required special risk assessment and protected personal data are given as examples which are classified, information about publicly known persons, information from certain clinics or medical specialties. So it is not the assessment of the employee referred to in this context. On the contrary have the legislator emphasizes precisely that even if health care should be able to have large trust in their employees, it is not in itself sufficient protection, The ethical principle of confidentiality in health care is deeply rooted information that emerges in the contact between healthcare professionals and patients is of course a strong counterforce to gossiping about patients or otherwise spreading information in an unacceptable way among co-workers. The same is true of the propensity to find out information about patients who are cared for in the workplace but who do not have one themselves professional relationship with. Given the scope of health care and the big picture the number of employed health and medical staff, about 300,000 people in the municipalities alone and the county council's health and medical care, however, it cannot be assumed that this is not the case at all occurs. The trend towards common widely available electronic journal systems within the large ones At the same time, the care providers' operations entail increased risks of invasion of privacy. If it increased potential availability of medical records is not handled well so that patients can feel confident that sensitive information is not read by unauthorized persons, there is a high risk of that patients choose to stay out of electronic access systems. Page 21 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 2 1 (34) A mixture of preventive and reactive measures is needed to prevent patient data shall be handled in an unacceptable manner (Bill 2007/08: 126 pp. 147-147). The process that Sahlgrenska described at the time of the inspection is thus not a needs and risk analysis according to ch. 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. The document Availability for operation of the electronic patient record Melior Sahlgrenska University Hospital has in supplementary information that received by the Swedish Data Inspectorate on 27 June 2019 stated that the document Accessibility to the operation of the electronic patient record Melior constitutes one needs and risk analysis. The document is stated to have been prepared in 2011 and to have as starting point to simplify access to patient data between the different the units within the hospital. However, it can be stated that by the document states that it aims to carry out a risk analysis regarding operation of the Melior medical record system. In the section “Risk identification and underlying causes ""the identified risks are either attributed to"" Part 1: Patient safety and operational perspective ”or“ Part 2: Technical safety with regard to availability for operation ”. Regarding the needs analysis, the document does not contain an analysis of which ones tasks employees need to be able to perform their tasks. Regarding the risk analysis, examples of risks such as identified in Part 1: Patient safety and operational perspective that “All IT related anomalies that may affect patient safety are not reported "", or ""Wrong patient is dictated on the wrong dictation"". Risks identified in Part 2: Technical safety with regard to availability for operation, is for example “unauthorized access to journal information ”, caused by“ transmission via open networks ”. There are risks from an information security perspective, however the document does not contain an analysis of the risks that may be associated with one too wide availability regarding different types of personal data. The document is thus an analysis from a business perspective and fulfills not the requirements for a needs and risk analysis from an integrity perspective according to 4 Cape. 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. The document risk and vulnerability analysis Sahlgrenska University Hospital also has due to The Data Inspectorate's inquiry as to what measures have been taken after Page 22 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 2 2 (34) the authority's decision 1607-2013, in which Sahlgrenska University Hospital was instructed to produce a documented needs and risk analysis, stated that In the spring of 2019, a needs and risk analysis was carried out. Sahlgrenska The University Hospital has submitted three different documents, a risk and vulnerability analysis, a so-called simplified needs and risk analysis with the title Needs and risk analysis when allocating individual eligibility to journal system, and a document entitled Needs and risk analysis at authorization allocation which can be said to constitute a brief account of how the other two documents are used in the business. Initially, it can It is stated that the documents were not produced until four years after the Data Inspectorate order. In addition, none of the documents submitted constitutes a need and risk analysis from an integrity perspective. Regarding the risk and vulnerability analysis, it is an analysis that must be performed according to the legislation on heightened preparedness and crisis preparedness 2 . Such a thing happens for other purposes and is not the same as a needs and risk analysis according to in ch. 4 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. It appears from the risk and vulnerability analysis that a measure to deal with one too at the level of eligibility should be to implement a simplified needs and risk analysis when allocating eligibility. The document thus states that a needs and risk analysis must be done, but does not in itself constitute one. The document does not contain an analysis of what tasks the employees have need in the journal system to be able to perform their tasks. The there are parts that concern the risk to the individual's integrity, but the so-called identified consequences do not constitute an analysis of risks in the current case the case but rather a statement of facts, such as that of a consequence that the internal area of ​​confidentiality is extensive is that “VGR has many employee which can lead to the permissions becoming too wide, which gives employees more competence than they need ”. In some parts contains the document identified risks which, however, do not aim at the protection of the integrity of the individual; for example, it is found that a consequence of that employees do not know what applies when accessing patient data is that “patients when requesting a log extract can see that an unauthorized person has looked in journal, bad will for SU ”. 2 Act (2006: 544) on municipalities 'and county councils' measures before and during extraordinary events in peacetime and heightened preparedness , ordinance (2015: 1052) on crisis preparedness and measures by the authorities responsible for surveillance in the event of heightened preparedness. Page 23 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 2 3 (34) In summary, the Data Inspectorate can state that the document does not contains analyzes of the need for access to personal data or the risks for the integrity of the individual arising from an excessively wide authorization, and thus does not meet the requirements of a needs and risk analysis from an integrity perspective according to ch. 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. The simplified needs and risk analysis Regarding the simplified needs and risk analysis that Sahlgrenska in risk and the vulnerability analysis determines to be done when authorization is granted it is initially stated that it is not compatible with in ch. § 2 HSLF- FS 2016: 40 to only perform a simplified needs and risk analysis. Further the document consists of a list of 14 questions to be answered with yes or no, such as “the employee knows that the computer must not be left unlocked, without supervision? ”. The Data Inspectorate can state that this is rather a question of a document to be used to create the conditions for a good information security at the individual level. It is an organizational measure to ensure an appropriate level of security, but it is not an analysis of the need for access to personal data or the risks to the privacy of the individual arises through an overly authoritative control. Thus does not meet nor does this document require a needs and risk analysis from one integrity perspective according to ch. 4 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. The document Needs and risk analysis when allocating eligibility Sahlgrenska University Hospital has also submitted a document in which the work with needs and risk analysis is briefly described. The document briefly describes how the risk and vulnerability analysis and the simplified one the needs and risk analysis is used in the business, and how Sahlgrenska The University Hospital prioritises accuracy and accessibility over confidentiality. The document does not contain any analyzes of the need for access to personal data or the risks to the privacy of the individual that arises through an overly allocation of competencies, and meets thus not the requirements for a needs and risk analysis according to ch. § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40. Instead, the document shows that Sahlgrenska University Hospital consciously prioritizes the requirement of confidentiality. The Swedish Data Inspectorate's summary assessment Page 24 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 2 4 (34) As stated above, in a needs and risk analysis, both the needs and the risks are assessed on the basis of the data that need to be processed in the business, what processes are involved and what are the risks for it individual integrity that exists on both organizational and individual level. It is thus a question of a strategic analysis at a strategic level, which shall provide an authorization structure that is adapted to the business. It should result in authorization assignments but it is not the instructions to the person who assigns the permissions that are the analysis. At the Data Inspectorate's review, Sahlgrenska University Hospital could not present any needs and risk analysis within the framework of internal secrecy or within the framework of the cohesive record keeping. Sahlgrenska University Hospital's document lacks it basic inventory of users' access and analysis needs of risks, nor has any balance been made between needs and those actual privacy risks that the processing of personal data gives rise to. In summary, the Data Inspectorate can state that the documents that have not been reported individually or together meet the requirements on a needs and risk analysis and that Sahlgrenska University Hospital does not have been able to show that they have carried out a needs and risk analysis in that sense referred to in ch. 4 § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40, neither within the framework of the internal confidentiality or within the framework of the unified record keeping, according to 4 respectively 6 chap. patient data law. This means that Sahlgrenska The University Hospital has not taken appropriate organizational measures in in accordance with Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 31 (1) and (2) in order to ensure and, in accordance with Article 5 (2), be able to demonstrate that the processing of personal data have a security that is appropriate in relation to the risks. Authorization of access to personal data about patients As reported above, a caregiver may have a legitimate interest in having a comprehensive processing of data on the health of individuals. Notwithstanding this shall access to personal data about patients may be limited to what is needed for the individual to be able to fulfill his or her duties. With regard to the allocation of authorization for electronic access according to ch. § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act states that in the preparatory work, Bill. 2007/08: 126 pp. 148-149, i.a. that there should be different eligibility categories in the journal system and that the permissions should be limited to what the user Page 25 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 2 5 (34) need to provide the patient with good and safe care. It also appears that “a more extensive or coarse-grained eligibility should be considered as one unjustified dissemination of medical records within a business and should as such is not accepted. "" In health care, it is the person who needs the information in their work who may be authorized to access them. This applies both within a caregivers as between caregivers. It is, as already mentioned, through the needs and risk analysis that the person responsible for personal data finds out who who need access, what information the access should include, at which times and in which contexts access is needed, and at the same time analyzes the risks to the individual's freedoms and rights the treatment can lead to. The result should then lead to the technical and organizational measures needed to ensure no allocation of eligibility provides further access opportunities than the one that needs and the risk analysis shows is justified. An important organizational measure is to provide instruction to those who have the authority to assign authorizations on how this should go to and what should be considered so that it, with the needs and risk analysis as a basis, becomes a correct authorization allocation in each individual case. As emerged in the case, about 900,000 patients are registered in Melior at Sahlgrenska University Hospital and the number of active accounts in Melior are almost 25,000, which exceeds the number of employees at Sahlgrenska The University Hospital, which at the time of the inspection was close to 18,000. Sahlgrenska University Hospital has assigned the employees who work with health care a general eligibility role - with or without emergency access - which provides access to all units' care documentation, with the exception of the clinical genetics unit which is not included in the general competences. Thus, the majority of users have actually had access to most of this information. This means that Sahlgrenska University Hospital does not sufficiently have restricted users' access to personal data about patients in the Melior medical record system. In addition, it can be stated that Sahlgrenska University Hospital has given direct access to personal data about patients at Sahlgrenska The University Hospital for employees at other administrations within Västra Götaland region. Page 26 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 2 6 (34) Access to personal data in Melior presupposes that the user is active choice. Sahlgrenska University Hospital has stated that they assess that the active selection function is sufficient to meet the requirement of confidentiality and that it is in accordance with HSLF-FS 2016: 40. The Data Inspectorate can however, note that the Patient Data Act requires both limitation of competencies and active choices. The active selection function is therefore not a measure to compensate for a lack of access restriction. That Sahlgrenska The University Hospital uses the above active choices is one privacy enhancing measure, but does not constitute such a restriction of competence referred to in ch. 4 Section 2 of the Patient Data Act. This provision requires that the authority be limited to what is needed for it individuals must be able to fulfill their duties in health care, i.e. only those who need the information should have access to them. Of the preparatory work for the Patient Data Act, Bill. 2007/08: 126, p. 149, it appears that the purpose of the provisions is to imprint the obligation on the person responsible the care provider to make active and individual eligibility allocations from outside analyzes of which details information different staff categories and different kind of activities need. Because different users have different tasks in different work areas, users need access to the data in Melior are limited to reflect this. Of the preparatory work it also appears that data should be stored in different layers so that more sensitive tasks require active choices or are otherwise not as easily accessible staff as less sensitive tasks. That the allocation of authorizations has not been preceded by a need and risk analysis means that Sahlgrenska University Hospital has not analyzed users' need for access to the data, the risks of this access can entail and thus also not identified which access is justified to users on the basis of such an analysis. Sahlgrenska The University Hospital has thus not used appropriate measures, in in accordance with Article 32, to restrict users' access to patients' data in the medical record system. Regarding the processing of personal data by Sahlgrenska The University Hospital performs within the framework of the cohesive record keeping in the NPÖ system, it can initially be stated that Page 27 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 2 7 (34) Sahlgrenska University Hospital has stated that Sahlgrenska The University Hospital is not responsible for that information shown in NPÖ. The Data Inspectorate does not share this view. According to 2 Cape. Section 6 of the Patient Data Act is in one region each authority that conducts and healthcare personal data controller for the processing of personal data carried out by the authority. According to the second paragraph of the provision covers personal data liability also such processing of personal data as the care provider, or the authority in a region or municipality that is personal data controller, performs when the care provider or authority through direct access in an individual case prepares access to personal data about a patient with another care provider or other authority in the same region or municipality. Sahlgrenska University Hospital is thus personal data controller for the processing of personal data that takes place when the employees take part in tasks in NPÖ. With regard to access to personal data within the framework of it cohesive record keeping in the NPÖ system has about 7,000 users Sahlgrenska University Hospital access. The Data Inspectorate can note that a limit has been placed on the number of users in compared to the approximately 25,000 who have eligibility in Melior, but do not any restriction has been made as to what documentation these are users can take part in the NPÖ system. This in turn has meant that there has been a risk of unauthorized access and unjustified dissemination of personal data partly within the framework of the internal secrecy, partly within the framework of the coherent record keeping. In the light of the above, the Data Inspectorate can state that Sahlgrenska University Hospital has processed personal data in violation of Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) of the Data Protection Regulation by Sahlgrenska University Hospital has not restricted users permissions for accessing the Melior journal system to what only is needed for the user to be able to fulfill his tasks within health care according to ch. 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act and 4 Cape. 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. This means that Sahlgrenska The University Hospital has not taken any measures to ensure and, in accordance with Article 5 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation, be able to demonstrate an appropriate security of personal data. Page 28 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 2 8 (34) Documentation of access (logs) The Data Inspectorate can state that the logs showing access in Melior contains information about the user's name and role, patients' identities, which part of the journal has been opened (eg journal, referrals, certificate - someone of the ""six tabs"") and the date and time the measures were taken. It is not clear at which care unit the measure was taken or which actions specifically taken by the user. Sahlgrenska has stated that information about which care unit the user is employed at can be checked through a search on where the user is employed. Sahlgrenska therefore means that by combining different logs, you can find out at which care unit as the measure has been taken. Each log entry in the logs constitutes the action “open journal"". In addition, it is not clear what actions the user has taken with information about a patient. Sahlgrenska University Hospital has in an opinion received The Data Inspectorate on 17 March 2020 stated that the measures set out in the logs are if an employee has opened the journal, about access to information occurred through active selection and if the employee from the journal has made one outlets to other care units. Sahlgrenska University Hospital states further that the documentation in the logs creates conditions for perform access controls in an appropriate manner, and that the logs meets the requirement to log which measures have been taken with information about a patient. It appears from the National Board of Health and Welfare's Handbook when applying The National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations and general guidelines (HSLF-FS 2016: 40) that “The caregiver is responsible, among other things, for the documentation of the access (logs) shows the measures that have been taken with information about a patient. An active choice to access information about a patient is an example of an action to be logged ”. The Data Inspectorate states that the purpose of the requirement that action be taken documented in the logs is not just to check if an employee prepared access to the journal, but also what measures have been taken information about a patient. The action documented in the logs “open journal ”is an example of an action that should be logged, and in addition should also other measures taken with information about a patient are documented in the logs. Other such measures may include the creation of personal data, copied, transferred, blocked, shredded or printed. the purpose with Page 29 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 2 9 (34) The security measure logs are to answer the question of who did what, it wants say who took what action, with what personal information and when. This constitutes an important part for the personal data controller to fulfill the requirement for appropriate security measures to control personal data; and how they are treated. The purpose of the access control security measure is to ensure that users do not misuse their permissions through to read, change or delete information that they should not process. To Sahlgrenska University Hospital only introduced documentation of the measure ""Open journal"", is thus not sufficient to meet the requirement in ch. § 9 (point 1) HSLF-FS 2016: 40 that the documentation of the access shall state what measures have been taken with information about a patient. Sahlgrenska University Hospital has thus treated and is treating personal data in violation of ch. 4 Section 3 of the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 § 9 (point 1) HSLF-FS 2016: 40. This means that Sahlgrenska University Hospital does not has taken appropriate technical and organizational measures in relation to the risk. Sahlgrenska University Hospital thus fulfills not the requirement to ensure adequate security for the treatment of personal data, in accordance with Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. Choice of intervention Legal regulation If there has been a violation of the Data Protection Regulation The Data Inspectorate a number of corrective powers available under the article 58.2 a – ji of the Data Protection Regulation. The supervisory authority can, among other things instruct the data controller to ensure that the processing takes place in in accordance with the Regulation and if required in a specific way and within a specific period. It follows from Article 58 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation that the Data Inspectorate in in accordance with Article 83 shall impose penalty charges in addition to or in lieu of other corrective measures referred to in Article 58 (2), the circumstances of each individual case. For the purposes of Article 83 (7) of the Data Protection Regulation, national authorities may: rules state that administrative sanctions may be imposed on authorities. According to ch. 6 Section 2 of the Data Protection Act allows for penalty fees to be decided authorities, but to a maximum of SEK 5,000,000 or SEK 10,000,000 Page 30 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 3 0 (34) depending on whether the infringement concerns articles covered by Article 83 (4) or 83.5 of the Data Protection Regulation. Article 83 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation sets out the factors to be taken into account for to decide whether to impose an administrative penalty fee, but also what is to affect the size of the penalty fee. Of central importance to the assessment of the gravity of the infringement is its nature, severity and duration. In the case of a minor infringement may the regulatory authority, in accordance with recital 148 of the Data Protection Regulation, issue a reprimand instead of imposing a penalty fee. Order As mentioned, the health service has a great need for information in its business and in recent years has a very extensive digitization occurred in healthcare. Both the data collections size and how many sharing information with each other has increased significantly. This increases the demands on the personal data controller, as the assessment of what is appropriate safety is affected by the extent of the treatment. In health care, this means that a great deal of responsibility rests on it personal data controller to protect the data from unauthorized access, among other things by having an authorization allocation that is even more comminuted. It is therefore essential that there is a real analysis of the needs based on different activities and different executives. Equally important is that there is an actual analysis of the risks from an integrity perspective may occur in the event of an override of access rights. From this analysis must then be restricted to the individual executive. This authority must then be followed up and changed or restricted accordingly hand that changes in the tasks of the individual executive provide reason for it. The Data Inspectorate's inspection has shown that Sahlgrenska University Hospital have not taken appropriate security measures to provide protection to the personal data in the record system by Sahlgrenska University hospital in its capacity as data controller did not comply with the requirements which is set in the Patient Data Act and the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations. Sahlgrenska The University Hospital has thereby failed to comply with the requirements in Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) of the Data Protection Regulation. The omission includes Page 31 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 3 1 (34) both the internal secrecy according to ch. the Patient Data Act as it coherent record keeping according to ch. 6 patient data law. The Data Inspectorate therefore submits on the basis of Article 58 (2) (d) data protection ordinance Sahlgrenska University Hospital to ensure that required needs and risk analysis is performed and documented for the medical systems Melior and National Patient Overview and that thereafter, with support of the needs and risk analysis, each user is assigned individually authorization for access to personal data limited to what only necessary for the individual to be able to fulfill his duties within health care, in accordance with Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) (i) the Data Protection Ordinance, Chapter 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act and 4 Cape. 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. Sahlgrenska University Hospital has also failed to include in the logs in Melior indicate what measures have been taken with information about a patient, a requirement which appears from ch. 4 Section 3 of the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 § 9 (item 1) HSLF-FS 2016: 40. The Data Inspectorate therefore submits Sahlgrenska University Hospital to introduce documentation in the logs in Melior where it shall state what measures have been taken with personal data about a patient according to ch. 4 Section 3 of the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 § 9 (item 1) HSLF-FS 2016: 40. Penalty fee The Data Inspectorate can state that the violations are basically related Sahlgrenska University Hospital's obligation to take appropriate security measures to provide protection of personal data according to the Data Protection Regulation. In this case, it is a matter of large data collections with sensitive personal data and extensive powers. The caregiver needs to be involved necessity to have a comprehensive processing of data on the health of individuals. However, it must not be unrestricted but should be based on what individual employees need to be able to perform their tasks. The Data Inspectorate notes that this is information that includes direct identification by the individual by name, contact information and social security number, information about health, but that it may also be about other private information about, for example, family relationships, sexual life and lifestyle. Patients is dependent on receiving care and is thus in a vulnerable situation. The data Page 32 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 3 2 (34) character, scope and patients' dependence position give caregivers a special responsibility to ensure patients' right to adequate protection for their personal data. Additional aggravating circumstances are the treatment of personal data about patients in the main medical record system belongs to the core of a the activities of caregivers, that the treatment covers many patients and that the possibility of access not only refers to a large proportion of employees but to Sahlgrenska University Hospital has also given access to a large number employees at other administrations within the Västra Götaland region. In this In this case, there are around 900,000 patients within the internal framework confidentiality, close to 18,000 employees and 25,000 active accounts. There is only one unit, the Clinical Genetics Unit, where the data is not accessible for users outside these devices because the device is excluded from the general competencies. The Data Inspectorate can also state that Sahlgrenska The University Hospital has not complied with the Data Inspectorate's decision of 27 March 2015. In the decision, Sahlgrenska University Hospital was instructed to carry out a documented needs and risk analysis according to the then requirement 2 chap. § 6 second paragraph second sentence SOSFS 2008: 14, which corresponds to the current provision in ch. 4 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. This is a aggravating circumstance, according to Article 83 (2) (e) of the Data Protection Regulation. The shortcomings that have now been established have thus been known to Sahlgrenska the university hospital for several years, which means that the action took place intentionally and thus is considered more serious. The Data Inspectorate also states that Sahlgrenska University Hospital in information received in the case has stated that the care provider accepts the risk that confidentiality is not given as high a priority as accuracy and availability. As the Data Inspectorate understands, Sahlgrenska has The university hospital has actively taken a position on giving priority to taking measures to protect the privacy of the individual, which makes the action more serious. Taken together, these factors mean that the infringements are not to be assessed as minor violations without violations that should lead to a administrative penalty fee. Page 33 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3840 3 3 (34) The Data Inspectorate considers that the violations are closely related to each other. That assessment is based on the need and risk analysis form the basis for the allocation of the authorizations. The Data Inspectorate therefore considers that these infringements are so closely linked that they constitute interconnected data processing within the meaning of Article 83 (3) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate therefore decides on a joint penalty fee for the infringements. Regarding the shortcomings in the logs, the Data Inspectorate can state that not all the information that should be included in the logs does so, but that logging essentially contains the information required by the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations. The Data Inspectorate therefore considers it sufficient that Sahlgrenska The university hospital is ordered to rectify the shortcoming and therefore does not decide any special penalty fee for this infringement. The administrative penalty fee shall be effective, proportionate and deterrent. This means that the amount must be determined so that it the administrative penalty fee leads to correction, that it provides a preventive effect and that it is also proportional in relation to both current violations as to the ability of the supervised entity to pay. The maximum amount for the penalty fee in this case is SEK 10 million according to ch. 6 Section 2 of the Act (2018: 218) with supplementary provisions to the EU data protection regulation. In view of the seriousness of the infringements and that the administrative the penalty fee must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive the Data Inspectorate determines the administrative sanction fee for Sahlgrenska University Hospital to 3,500,000 (three million five hundred thousand crowns. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This decision was made by Director General Lena Lindgren Schelin after presentation by the IT security specialist Magnus Bergström.

December 2019 established that the Health and Medical Care Board at Region Västerbotten processes personal data in breach of Article 5 (1) (f) and (2) and Article 32 (1) 1 0ch 32.2 of the Data Protection Regulation by 1. The Health and Medical Care Board has not implemented needs and risk analysis before allocation of authorizations takes place in the record system NCS Cross, in accordance with ch. § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act (2008: 355) and ch. 4 Section 2 of the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations and general advice (HSLF-FS 2016: 40) on record keeping and treatment of personal data in health care. This means that Health and the health care board has not taken appropriate organizational measures to be able to ensure and be able to show that the treatment of the personal data has a security that is appropriate in relation to the risks. 2. The Health and Medical Care Board has not restricted users permissions for accessing the NCS Cross journal system to what only needed for the user to be able to fulfill theirs tasks in health care in accordance with Chapter 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40. This means that the Health and Medical Care Board does not have taken measures to be able to ensure and be able to show a suitable security of personal data. The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of Articles 58 (2) and 83 i the Data Protection Ordinance and Chapter 6 § 2 of the law (2018: 218) with supplementary provisions to the EU Data Protection Regulation that the and the Board of Health, for the infringements of Article 5 (1) (f) and (2), and Article 32 (1) and (2) of the Data Protection Regulation, shall pay a administrative penalty fee of 2,500,000 (two million five hundred thousand) kronor. 1 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on protection for natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free flow of such information and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Regulation). Page 3 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 4 (29) The Data Inspectorate submits pursuant to Article 58 (2) (d) i the Data Protection Ordinance, the Health and Medical Care Board to implement and document the required needs and risk analysis for the NCS medical record system Cross and then, with the support of the needs and risk analysis, assign each user individual authorization for access to personal data to only what is needed for the individual to be able to fulfill his or her duties in the field of health, in accordance with Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and 32.2 of the Data Protection Ordinance, Chapter 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. Report on the supervisory matter The Data Inspectorate initiated supervision by letter dated 22 March 2019 and on the spot on 14 May 2019 and 12 December 2019 reviewed whether the Health and the Health Care Board's decision on the allocation of authorizations has been preceded of a needs and risk analysis. The review has also included how the Health and the health care board assigned authorizations for access to the main journal system NCS Cross, and what access possibilities they were allocated the authorizations provide within the framework of the internal secrecy according to ch. the Patient Data Act, as the cohesive record keeping according to ch. patient data law. In addition to this, the Data Inspectorate has also examined which one documentation of access (logs) contained in the record system. The Data Inspectorate has only examined the user's access options to the journal system, i.e. what care documentation the user can actually take part of and read. Supervision does not include the functions included in the competence, ie. what the user can actually do in the journal system (eg issuing prescriptions, writing referrals, etc.). Previous review of needs and risk analyzes The Data Inspectorate has previously carried out an inspection regarding the then The County Council Board, Västerbotten County Council had implemented one documented needs and risk analysis according to ch. § 6 second paragraph second the sentence of the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations (SOSFS 2008: 14) on information management and record keeping in health care. Of The Data Inspectorate's decision with record number 1615-2013, announced on 27 March 2015, it appears that the County Council Board did not meet the requirement that Page 4 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 5 (29) carry out a needs and risk analysis in accordance with the said regulations, and was therefore instructed to implement one for the main record system. What has emerged in the case The Health and Medical Care Board has mainly stated the following. Personal data manager On January 1, 2019, a reorganization was made which meant that Region Västerbotten was formed. There is no authority under Health and the health care board. The Health and Medical Care Board conducts health and healthcare within the region and is responsible for the processing of personal data personal data that the business performs in the main record system NCS Cross. Journal system The main journal system used is called NCS Cross and stands for Nordic Clinical Suite. It is possible to take part in care documentation in NCS Cross from 1993 when the system was introduced. At that time was the allocation of privileges was more limited and users had access to fewer data than in the current system. The so-called Employee Assignments was added in 2014–2015. Employee assignments regulate on which organizational level access can be done in NCS Cross and is required to access the system. NCS Cross is used within the framework of coherent record keeping together with seven other care providers. In connection with the Data Protection Ordinance began to apply the supplier a general review of the system and informed that no functional adjustments needed to be made. There are 101 databases in NCS Cross based on the fact that each clinic basically has one own database. Within Region Västerbotten, the number of units is 84 (active databases). Within NCS Cross, there are so-called protected units. In NCS Cross, it is possible to control the staff's access possibilities different ways in terms of authorization management, including through employee assignments and functions for blocking records. Protected information, about patients with a protected identity at the Swedish Tax Agency, is not available in NCS Cross. Page 5 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 6 (29) The number of patients and employees The number of unique registered patients in NCS Cross within the framework of the internal the confidentiality is 652,995. The number of patients registered within the framework for unified record keeping is 665,564. There are approximately 10,000 employees in the Västerbotten Region. Within the region 9,139 users have a valid employee assignment and active account in NCS Cross. The number of active user accounts in the region is 12,366. The reason to the difference in the number of users is that the businesses have not reported to the administration that the authorization is to be terminated. Access to NCS Cross stopped anyway because the users who do not have an employee assignment can not log in to the application. The process is automated so that the AD the account and thus also the employee assignment is automatically closed when the employment ends. Internal secrecy Needs and risk analysis The Data Inspectorate's decision of 27 March 2015 states that The County Council Board, Västerbotten County Council, was instructed to produce one documented needs and risk analysis for the main record system. Against this background, the Health and Medical Care Board has stated, among other things following. The Health and Medical Care Board has followed the Data Inspectorate's previous decisions and produced the documents Guideline for information security and management and operation and Template - Needs and risk analysis at authorization. The control document and the template have been prepared to provide the business managers tools in connection with the allocation of authority. Documents User profiles are examples that clarify that permissions not assigned generally but individually. The documents are also examples of performed analyzes at actual eligibility assignments within various devices. The needs and risk analysis is made from the business perspective and not from an integrity perspective. 2 The documents have been received by the Data Inspectorate. Page 6 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 7 (29) The board does not know to what extent the template Template - Needs and risk analysis when allocating privileges is used in the business, when you only see the result of the authorization order itself. The board has assumed that the business managers make a needs and risk analysis before ordering permissions. However, the committee has not seen any documented needs and risk analysis neither for the internal confidentiality nor for the cohesive record keeping. The guidelines for information security state that authorization must be granted after an analysis of what information different staff categories in different businesses need. The guidelines also state that the risk analysis must take place consideration of the risks it may entail if the staff has too little or too little much access to various patient data. Then the needs vary between different types of activities, the business manager is responsible for the needs and risk analysis is performed at unit level. According to the guidelines, the business should document the needs and risk analysis when allocating the employee assignment. The guidelines also state, among other things, that in addition to regular inspections of the users' authorization needs, the authorizations shall be reviewed accordingly organizational and system change. Authorization of access to personal data about patients The Health and Medical Care Board has mainly stated the following. In order for an executive to be able to access personal data in NCS Cross several conditions need to be met. The executive must have one active user account in the region domain (AD). This in turn presupposes that the executive is registered in the HR system. To be able to log in to domain, executives need a SITHS card with one or more valid ones certificate. To then be able to log in to NCS Cross needs the executive partly have a valid so-called employee assignment, partly become assigned a license in NCS Cross. The employee assignment regulates on which organizational level access can be done in NCS Cross. It is the heads of operations of the various units that decide on the allocation of the employee assignment to his staff at the care unit. Page 7 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 8 (29) Two-step authentication ""that you really are who you are"" and that access closes to the user when he quits are examples of actual actions such as taken to prevent unnecessary dissemination of personal data. The qualifications assigned to the staff are based on the needs analysis that is performed before the assignment, ie where and with what the employee works. For example, counselors and physiotherapists may be employed in different units, which means that they have more employee assignments and thus must be given access to more devices. The same applies to emergency physicians who also have access to more units than the own emergency database. The staff's access to databases is based on the need that exists. One employee assignments can thus mean that an employee can be authorized to multiple databases. A nurse at Neurocentrum can, for example, get one employee assignments with access to eight databases because the clinic has eight databases and the nurse's work requires access to all of them. Access opportunities (read access) to care documentation in NCS Cross Each employee has a reading authority that is adapted based on the individual's mission. If an employee is granted reading permission within the entire Region Västerbotten only applies to care documentation. Protected devices are excluded. In the NCS Cross access control system, there are two types of access Own competence, partly Service role. Own competence means that an executive is given access to them functions in the record system that are relevant to the executive tasks, such as prescribing medicines. Own authority also means that the executive is given permission to read and write to them parts of the journal system (databases) that are linked to it or they care units where the executive is active. Eligibility according to the position role means that an executive is also given read access to other databases in the journal system. The executive can then the service role is given Reading permission VLL which means access (read access) to all units' care documentation in the Region Västerbotten, except for protected units. Executives can be assigned one other reading permission than Reading permission VLL. Read access to Page 8 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 9 (29) personal data of protected entities are provided only within the framework of the allocation of Own authority. The module that handles the journal in NCS Cross is heading Care documentation. The module contains all documentation that is available the patient in accordance with ch. 4 § 1 Patient Data Act. There are others as well modules, such as Care Administration, which contain information in accordance with ch. 2 4 § 2 of the Patient Data Act. Doctors are almost always assigned a Reading Permit VLL. Regarding the nurses are often ordered to read VLL, which means that a majority of nurses are assigned this reading privilege. Have the staff assigned write permission in the system, it means that the staff also has readability in it. The number of executives who have Reading Authorization VLL in NCS Cross has a total of 7,586. Of these, 2,290 are doctors, 3,759 are nurses, 124 are assistant nurses including pediatric nurses and 956 are paramedics. The information is valid for December 2019. Restrictions on access to data in NCS Cross There are no direct obstacles to introducing restrictive features read access and thus access in NCS Cross. The system enables allocating permissions that give users different access options. It can be done on an individual level. You can also restrict access to some devices. Technically, for example, it is possible to exclude BUP from access possibilities. Operations managers can restrict access and control privileges so that the staff of a unit has access to data only about care and treatment at the relevant unit and not such information at others devices. Within NCS Cross 84 units, there are the following six protected units. 1) The device clinical genetics, 2) Unit for Child and Adolescent Habilitation 3) Section child and adolescent habilitation within the unit child and adolescent clinic Västerbotten 4) Section for orphanages, within the unit for children and youth psychiatry Västerbotten 5) Occupational health care 6) The LSS units in disability activities, visual and hearing rehabilitation and support and habilitation for adults and the section on the exercise of authority in the Support unit and habilitation for adults. Page 9 of 29Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3841 1 0 (29) An active choice for access is required by the user when the patient has blocked his care documentation. Coherent record keeping The Health and Medical Care Board has mainly stated the following. Needs and risk analysis Template Template - Needs and risk analysis when granting eligibility also applies for the unified record keeping. Needs analysis done before authorization allocation also includes analysis for access within the framework of coherent record keeping. Authorization of access to personal data about patients If an employee has been granted reading permission in the internal secrecy, it means that he has also been granted reading permission for the unified record keeping. Access opportunities (read access) to care documentation in NCS Cross The reading authority within the coherent record keeping is the same as for internal secrecy. This means that the staff can take part in everything care documentation about all patients who are in the system for it coherent record keeping. The basis for this lies employee assignment. Restrictions on access to data in NCS Cross Employees must make active choices to access information in it keep records in mind, ie answer the question of whether the patient has given their consent or state that there is an emergency to be able to take part of the data. Documentation of access (logs) The Health and Medical Care Board has stated, among other things, the following. Each time a user enters NCS Cross, the activity is logged. The search on a patient can be done on social security number or backup number. According to guidelines, the system must once a month select ten users on one unit. In such a log check, all patient records are displayed as respective users opened for login during the checked log period as well all activities done in the care portal: time, activity, social security number, Page 10 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 1 1 (29) patient, journal, information, staff, title, location, client, purpose and date. In the log extract, it is stated under the heading Client at which unit the measures have been taken, ie which care unit's employee assignment the user used at login. Under the heading Journal it is stated database from which the staff retrieved data, ie at which care unit documentation the user reads in. The database called Medicincentrum contains care documentation from two care units, partly Medicincentrum, partly Hjärtcentrum. If, for example login is done in the database Medicincentrum by a doctor who works at the unit Medicincentrum, the log extract will state Medicincentrum both under the heading Client and the heading Journal. About the doctor on the other hand, working at the Heart Center, it appears in the log extract under the heading Client to be specified Heart Center. The log entries generated refer to both the internal confidentiality and the coherent record keeping. The Health and Medical Care Board has submitted to the Swedish Data Inspectorate log extract with documentation of the accesses (logs) that were created with due to the inspection of the inspection. Grounds for the decision Applicable rules The Data Protection Regulation is the primary source of law The Data Protection Regulation, often abbreviated GDPR, was introduced on 25 May 2018 and is the primary legal regulation in the processing of personal data. This also applies to health care. The basic principles for the processing of personal data are set out in Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation. A basic principle is the requirement security pursuant to Article 5 (1) (f), which states that personal data shall be processed in a way that ensures adequate security for personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unauthorized treatment and against loss, Page 11 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 1 2 (29) destruction or damage by accident, using appropriate technical or organizational measures. Article 5 (2) states the so-called liability, ie. that it personal data controllers must be responsible for and be able to show that the basic the principles set out in paragraph 1 are complied with. Article 24 deals with the responsibility of the controller. Of Article 24 (1) it appears that the person responsible for personal data is responsible for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate that the processing is performed in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. The measures shall carried out taking into account the nature, scope, context of the treatment and purposes and the risks, of varying degrees of probability and severity, for freedoms and rights of natural persons. The measures must be reviewed and updated if necessary. Article 32 regulates the security associated with the processing. According to paragraph 1 the personal data controller and the personal data assistant shall take into account of the latest developments, implementation costs and treatment nature, scope, context and purpose as well as the risks, of varying probability and seriousness, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of safety appropriate to the risk (…). According to paragraph 2, when assessing the appropriate level of safety, special consideration is given to the risks which the treatment entails, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or to unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data transferred, stored or otherwise processed. Recital 75 states that in assessing the risk to natural persons rights and freedoms, various factors must be taken into account. Among other things mentioned personal data covered by professional secrecy, health data or sexual life, if the processing of personal data concerning vulnerable physical persons takes place persons, especially children, or if the treatment involves a large number personal data and applies to a large number of registered persons. Furthermore, it follows from recital 76 that the probable and serious risk of it data subjects' rights and freedoms should be determined on the basis of processing nature, scope, context and purpose. The risk should be evaluated on Page 12 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 1 3 (29) on the basis of an objective assessment, which determines whether the data processing involves a risk or a high risk. Recitals 39 and 83 also contain writings that provide guidance on it the meaning of the data protection regulation's requirements for security in Processing of personal data. The Data Protection Regulation and the relationship with complementary national provisions According to Article 5 (1). a in the Data Protection Regulation, the personal data shall treated in a lawful manner. In order for the treatment to be considered legal, it is required legal basis by fulfilling at least one of the conditions of Article 6 (1). The provision of health care is one such task of general interest referred to in Article 6 (1). e. In health care, the legal bases can also be legal obligation under Article 6 (1). c and the exercise of authority under Article 6 (1) (e) updated. When it comes to the legal bases legal obligation, in general interest or exercise of authority by the Member States, in accordance with Article 6.2, maintain or introduce more specific provisions for adaptation the application of the provisions of the Regulation to national circumstances. National law may specify specific requirements for the processing of data and other measures to ensure legal and equitable treatment. But there is not only one possibility to introduce national rules but also one duty; Article 6 (3) states that the basis for the treatment referred to in paragraph 1 (c) and (e) shall be determined in accordance with Union law or national law of the Member States. The legal basis may also include specific provisions to adapt the application of the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation. Union law or the national law of the Member States law must fulfill an objective of general interest and be proportionate to it legitimate goals pursued. Article 9 states that the treatment of specific categories of personal data (so-called sensitive personal data) is prohibited. Sensitive personal data includes data on health. Article 9 (2) states except when sensitive personal data may still be processed. Page 13 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 1 4 (29) Article 9 (2) (h) states that the processing of sensitive personal data may be repeated the treatment is necessary for reasons related to, among other things the provision of health care on the basis of Union law or national law of the Member States or in accordance with agreements with professionals in the field of health and provided that the conditions and protective measures provided for in referred to in paragraph 3 are met. Article 9 (3) imposes a regulated duty of confidentiality. This means that both the legal bases of general interest, exercise of authority and legal obligation in the treatment of the vulnerable personal data under the exemption in Article 9 (2). h need supplementary rules. Supplementary national regulations In the case of Sweden, both the basis for the treatment and those special conditions for the processing of personal data in the field of health and healthcare regulated in the Patient Data Act (2008: 355), and the Patient Data Ordinance (2008: 360). I 1 kap. Section 4 of the Patient Data Act states that the law complements the data protection regulation. The purpose of the Patient Data Act is to provide information in health and healthcare must be organized so as to meet patient safety and good quality and promotes cost efficiency. Its purpose is also to personal data shall be designed and otherwise processed so that patients and the privacy of other data subjects is respected. In addition, must be documented personal data is handled and stored so that unauthorized persons do not have access to it them (Chapter 1, Section 2 of the Patient Data Act). The supplementary provisions in the Patient Data Act aim to: take care of both privacy protection and patient safety. The legislator has thus through the regulation made a balance as to how the information must be processed to meet both the requirements for patient safety as the right to privacy in the processing of personal data. The National Board of Health and Welfare has, with the support of the Patient Data Ordinance, issued regulations and general advice on record keeping and processing of personal data in health care (HSLF-FS 2016: 40). The regulations constitute such supplementary rules, which shall be applied in the care provider's treatment of personal data in health care. Page 14 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 1 5 (29) National provisions supplementing the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation safety can be found in Chapters 4 and 6. the Patient Data Act and Chapters 3 and 4 HSLF-FS 2016: 40. Requirement to do needs and risk analysis The care provider must, according to ch. § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40 make a needs and risk analysis, before the allocation of authorizations in the system takes place. That the analysis requires both the needs and the risks is clear from the preparatory work to the Patient Data Act, prop. 2007/08: 126 pp. 148-149, as follows. Authorization for staff's electronic access to patient information shall limited to what the executive needs to be able to perform his tasks in health care. This includes that permissions should followed up and changed or reduced over time as changes in the individual the executive's duties give rise to it. The provision corresponds in principle to section 8 of the Health Care Register Act. The purpose of the provision is to imprint the obligation of the responsible caregiver to make active and individual eligibility assignments based on analyzes of which details information different staff categories and different types of activities need. But not only needs analyzes are needed. Risk analyzes must also be done where you take them taking into account various types of risks that may be associated with an excessively wide availability of certain types of data. Protected personal data that is classified, information on public figures, information from certain receptions or medical specialties are examples of categories that can require special risk assessments. In general, it can be said that the more comprehensive an information system is, the more there must be a greater variety of eligibility levels. Decisive for decision on eligibility for e.g. different categories of health care professionals to electronic access to information in patient records should be that the authorization should limited to what the executive needs for the purpose a good and safe patient care. A more extensive or coarse-grained allocation of competences should - even if it would have points from an efficiency point of view - considered as one unjustified dissemination of journal information within a business and should as such not accepted. Furthermore, data should be stored in different layers so that sensitive information is required to be active choices or otherwise are not as easily accessible to staff as less sensitive tasks. In the case of staff working with business follow-up, statistical production, central financial administration and similar activities which is not individual-oriented, this should be sufficient for most executives access to data that can only be indirectly derived from individual patients. Electronic access to code keys, social security numbers and other information such as Page 15 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 1 6 (29) directly pointing out individual patients should be able to be strong in this area limited to individuals. Internal secrecy The provisions in ch. 4 The Patient Data Act concerns internal confidentiality, ie. regulates how privacy protection is to be handled within a care provider's business and especially employees' opportunities to prepare for personal data that is electronically available in a healthcare provider organisation. It appears from ch. Section 2 of the Patient Data Act, that the care provider shall decide conditions for granting access to such data patients who are fully or partially automated. Such authorization shall limited to what is needed for the individual to be able to fulfill theirs tasks in health care. According to ch. 4 § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40, the care provider shall be responsible for each users are assigned an individual privilege to access personal data. The caregiver's decision on the allocation of eligibility shall preceded by a needs and risk analysis. Coherent record keeping The provisions in ch. 6 the Patient Data Act concerns cohesive record keeping, which means that a care provider - under the conditions specified in § 2 the same chapter - may have direct access to personal data processed by others caregivers for purposes related to care documentation. The access to information is provided by a healthcare provider making the information about a patient which the care provider registers if the patient is available to other care providers who participate in the coherent record keeping (see Bill 2007/08: 126 p. 247). Of ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act follows that the provisions in Chapter 4 § 2 also applies to authorization allocation for coherent record keeping. The requirement of that the care provider must perform a needs and risk analysis before allocating permissions in the system take place, thus also applies in systems for cohesion record keeping. Page 16 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 1 7 (29) Documentation of access (logs) Of ch. 4 Section 3 of the Patient Data Act states that a care provider must ensure that access to such data on patients who are kept in whole or in part automatically documented and systematically checked. According to ch. 4 Section 9 HSLF-FS 2016: 40, the care provider shall be responsible for that 1. it appears from the documentation of the access (logs) which measures taken with information on a patient, 2. it appears from the logs at which care unit or care process measures have been taken, 3. the logs indicate the time at which the measures were taken; 4. the identity of the user and the patient is stated in the logs. The Data Inspectorate's assessment Personal data controller's responsibility for security As previously described, Article 24 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation provides a general requirement for the personal data controller to take appropriate technical and organizational measures. The requirement is partly to ensure that the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with the Data Protection Ordinance, and that the data controller must be able to demonstrate that the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. The safety associated with the treatment is regulated more specifically in the articles 5.1 (f) and Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. Article 32 (1) states that the appropriate measures shall be both technical and organizational and that they must ensure an appropriate level of security in in relation to the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons which the treatment entails. It is therefore necessary to identify the possible ones the risks to the data subjects' rights and freedoms and assess the probability of the risks occurring and the severity if they occur. What is appropriate varies not only in relation to the risks but also based on the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment. It has thus the significance of what personal data is processed, how many data, it is a question of how many people process the data, etc. Page 17 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 1 8 (29) The health service has a great need for information in its operations. The It is therefore natural that the possibilities of digitalisation are utilized as much as possible in healthcare. Since the Patient Data Act was introduced, a lot extensive digitization has taken place in healthcare. Both the data collections size as the number of people sharing information with each other has increased substantially. At the same time, this increase means that the demands on it increase personal data controller, as the assessment of what is an appropriate safety is affected by the extent of the treatment. It is also a question of sensitive personal data. The information concerns people who are in a situation of dependence when they are in need of care. It is also often a question of a lot of personal information about each of these people and the data may over time may be processed by very many people in healthcare. All in all, this places great demands on it personal data controllers. The data processed must be protected from outside actors as well the business as against unauthorized access from within the business. It appears of Article 32 (2) that the data controller, in assessing the appropriate level of safety, in particular shall take into account the risks of unintentional or illegal destruction, loss or unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access. In order to be able to know what is an unauthorized access it must personal data controllers must be clear about what is an authorized access. Needs and risk analysis I 4 kap. Section 2 of the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations (HSLF-FS 2016: 40), which supplement In the Patient Data Act, it is stated that the care provider must make a needs and risk analysis before the allocation of authorizations in the system takes place. This means that national law prescribes requirements for an appropriate organizational measure that shall: taken before the allocation of authorizations to journal systems takes place. A needs and risk analysis must include an analysis of the needs and a analysis of the risks from an integrity perspective that may be associated with an overly allotment of access to personal data about patients. Both the needs and the risks must be assessed on the basis of them tasks that need to be processed in the business, what processes it is the question of whether and what risks to the privacy of the individual exist. Page 18 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 1 9 (29) The assessments of the risks need to be made on the basis of organizational level, there for example, a certain business part or task may be more privacy sensitive than another, but also based on the individual level, if it is the issue of special circumstances that need to be taken into account, such as that it is a question of protected personal data or data of general famous people. The size of the system also affects the risk assessment. Of The preparatory work for the Patient Data Act states that the more comprehensive one information system is, the greater the variety of authorization levels required there is. (Prop. 2007/08: 126 p. 149). It is thus a question of a strategic analysis at a strategic level, which should give one authorization structure that is adapted to the business and this must be maintained updated. In summary, the regulation requires that the risk analysis identifies  different categories of data (eg data on health), Categories of data subjects (eg vulnerable natural persons and children), or  the scope (eg number of personal data and registered)  negative consequences for data subjects (eg injuries, significant social or economic disadvantage, deprivation of rights and freedoms), and how they affect the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons Processing of personal data. This applies both within internal secrecy as in coherent record keeping. The risk analysis must also include special risk assessments, for example based on whether there is protected personal data that is classified, information on public figures, information from certain clinics or medical specialties (Bill 2007/08: 126 p. 148- 149). The risk analysis must also include an assessment of how probable and serious the risk to the data subjects' rights and freedoms is and in any case determined whether it is a risk or a high risk (recital 76). It is thus through the needs and risk analysis that it personal data controller finds out who needs access, which Page 19 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 2 0 (29) information the accessibility shall include, at what times and at what context access is needed, while analyzing the risks to it the freedoms and rights of the individual that the treatment may lead to. The result should then lead to the technical and organizational measures needed to ensure that no one other than the one who needs and the risk analysis shows that it should be justified. When a needs and risk analysis is missing prior to the allocation of qualifications in system, lacks the basis for the personal data controller on a legal be able to assign their users a correct authorization. The the data controller is responsible for, and shall have control over, the personal data processing that takes place within the framework of the business. To assign users a when accessing journal system, without this being founded on a performed needs and risk analysis, means that the person responsible for personal data does not have sufficient control over the personal data processing that takes place in the journal system and also can not show that he has the control that required. The Health and Medical Care Board's work with needs and risk analysis When the Data Inspectorate has requested a documented needs and risk analysis, the Health and Medical Care Board has stated that the board has done a needs and risk analysis, but only from the business perspective, not from the integrity perspective. The Data Inspectorate therefore wants to emphasize that is not enough to do a needs analysis. As previously described, appears from Article 32 of the Data Protection Ordinance and the National Board of Health and Welfare regulations, it is required that the Health and Medical Care Board must also make one risk analysis where the board considers various risks that may be associated with one too in the availability of different types of personal data about patients for to then weigh the needs of the business against the risks for the individual integrity. In addition, the personal data controller, according to i the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation under Article 5, be able to show that, among other things, appropriate organizational measures have been taken. The Health and Medical Care Board has referred to the heads of operations is responsible for a needs and risk analysis. The Data Inspectorate therefore wants also emphasize that the board as the person responsible for personal data can not waive take responsibility for the analysis and, on the basis of it, take appropriate technical and organizational measures. This means that the board should have ensured Page 20 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 2 1 (29) the implementation of a needs and risk analysis according to ch. § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40 and documented it. A needs and risk analysis must be performed at a strategic level The Health and Medical Care Board has stated that the board after The Data Inspectorate's previous injunction produced documents to provide business managers tools for assigning permissions. The committee has referred to the documents Guideline for information security - management and operation and the template Template- Needs and risk analysis when allocating authorization The Data Inspectorate states that the guidelines and the template are about allocation of authorizations and that the documents are based on a need and risk analysis must be done in connection with the actual allocation. (In the guidelines states, for example, that a risk analysis must be performed to shed light on different types of risks associated with too extensive availability and that documentation of completed needs and risk analysis must be archived at the unit. In the template referred to the Patient Data Act and that a decision on allocation must be preceded by a needs and risk analysis). The Data Inspectorate therefore wants to emphasize that a needs and risk analysis shall establish an overall competence structure which in turn should form the basis for the allocation of qualifications to be made for each individual executive. The strategic analysis to be taken is thus further than the analysis made at the actual allocation of the powers. A properly conducted needs and risk analysis is one prerequisite for a correct allocation of authorizations. The Health and Medical Care Board has also referred to the documents User profiles as examples of analyzes performed at actual authorization assignments. The Data Inspectorate also finds in this case that it is not a question of any needs and risk analysis. The Swedish Data Inspectorate's summary assessment As stated above, in a needs and risk analysis, both the needs and the risks are assessed on the basis of the data that need to be processed in the business, what processes are involved and what are the risks for it individual integrity that exists on both organizational and individual level. It is thus a question of a strategic analysis at a strategic level, which should provide a basis for an authorization structure that is adapted to the activities. It should result in authorization assignments but it is not the instructions to the person who assigns the permissions that are the analysis. Page 21 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 2 2 (29) In summary, the Data Inspectorate states that the Health and the health care board has not submitted any documented needs and risk analysis. The committee has also stated that it has not seen anyone documented such. The Health and Medical Care Board has thus not been able to show that the board has carried out a needs and risk analysis in the sense that referred to in ch. 4 § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40, neither within the framework of the internal confidentiality or within the framework of coherent record keeping. This means that the Health and Medical Care Board has not taken appropriate organizational measures in accordance with Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 31 (1) and (2) for be able to ensure and, in accordance with Article 5 (2), be able to demonstrate that: the processing of personal data has a security that is appropriate in in relation to the risks. Authorization of access to personal data about patients As reported above, a caregiver may have a legitimate interest in having a comprehensive processing of data on the health of individuals. Notwithstanding this shall access to personal data about patients may be limited to what is needed for the individual to be able to fulfill his or her duties. With regard to the allocation of authorization for electronic access according to ch. § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act states that in the preparatory work, Bill. 2007/08: 126 pp. 148-149, i.a. that there should be different eligibility categories in the journal system and that the permissions should be limited to what the user need to provide the patient with good and safe care. It also appears that “a more extensive or coarse-grained eligibility should be considered as one unauthorized dissemination of journal information within a business and should as such is not accepted ”. In health care, it is the person who needs the information in their work who may be authorized to access them. This applies both within a caregivers as between caregivers. It is, as already mentioned, through the needs and risk analysis that the person responsible for personal data finds out who who need access, what information the access should include, at which times and in which contexts access is needed, and at the same time analyzes the risks to the individual's freedoms and rights the treatment can lead to. The result should then lead to the technical and organizational measures needed to ensure no allocation of eligibility provides further access opportunities than the one that needs and Page 22 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 2 3 (29) the risk analysis shows is justified. An important organizational measure is to provide instruction to those who have the authority to assign authorizations on how this should go to and what should be considered so that it, with the needs and risk analysis as a basis, becomes a correct authorization allocation in each individual case. That the Health and Medical Care Board's allocation of qualifications does not have preceded by a needs and risk analysis means that the board has not analyzed users' need for access to the data, the risks that this access may entail and thus also not identified which access that is justified to users based on such an analysis. The committee has therefore not taken appropriate action in accordance with Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation, to restrict users' access to patients' personal data in the medical record system. This in turn has meant that there has been a risk of unauthorized access and unjustified dissemination of personal data partly within the framework of the internal secrecy, partly within the framework of the coherent record keeping. In the case, it has emerged that the number of registered patients in NCS Cross within the internal secrecy is just over 650,000 and within the framework of cohesive record keeping just over 665,000. The case has also emerged that there are about 10,000 employees in the region and that just over 7,500 executives have been awarded Reading VLL in NCS Cross. This authorization gives access (read access) to all devices care documentation in the Västerbotten Region, except the one prepared on protected devices. Of a total of 84 units, six are protected devices. In summary, the Data Inspectorate states that this means that the majority of the employees have had actual access to the care documentation of the majority of patients in NCS Cross. Care documentation means that it is a question of health information, so-called sensitive personal data within the meaning of Article 9 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. By that the personal data controller only restricted access to permissions in NCS Cross to data available on protected devices thus has there has been a risk of unauthorized access and unauthorized distribution of personal data partly within the framework of internal secrecy, partly within the framework for the unified record keeping. Page 23 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 2 4 (29) The Health and Medical Care Board has stated that an active choice for access is required by the user when the patient has blocked their care documentation. The Data Inspectorate wants to emphasize that an active choice is an enhancement of integrity measure but does not constitute such an access restriction as referred to in ch. § 2 patient data law. This provision requires that the jurisdiction be restricted to what is needed for the individual to be able to fulfill his tasks in health care, ie. only those in need the data must have access to them. Of the preparatory work for Patient Data Act, prop. 2007/08: 126, p. 149, it appears that information in addition need to be stored in different layers so that more sensitive data require active choices or otherwise are not as easily accessible to staff as less sensitive tasks. Against this background, the Data Inspectorate can state that the Health and the Health Care Board has processed personal data in violation of Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) of the Data Protection Regulation by the Board not has restricted users' permissions to access the journal system NCS Cross to what is only needed for the user to be able to fulfill their duties in health and medical care according to ch. § 2 and ch. 6 7 § the Patient Data Act and ch. 4 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. This means that the Health and the health care board has not taken measures to be able to ensure and, in accordance with Article 5 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation, be able to display a appropriate security for personal data. Documentation of access (logs) Based on the logs created as a result of the inspection reviews together with the information provided by the board the heading in the log extracts, the Data Inspectorate states that of the log extracts show the following:  under the heading Activity, what measures have been taken information about a patient, for example to ""read"".  under the headings Journal at which care unit or care process measures have been taken  under the heading Time at which time the measures were taken  under the headings Patient and Personal of the user and the patient identity. The Data Inspectorate finds that the documentation of the access (the logs) in NCS Cross is in accordance with the requirements set out in ch. § 9 HSLF- Page 24 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 2 5 (29) FS 2016: 40 and that the Health and Medical Care Board thus in this part has have taken appropriate technical measures in accordance with Article 32 i the Data Protection Regulation. Choice of intervention Legal regulation If there has been a violation of the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation the Data Inspectorate has a number of corrective powers available according to Article 58 (2) (a) to (j) of the Data Protection Regulation. The supervisory authority may include otherwise instruct the person responsible for personal data to ensure that the processing takes place in accordance with the Regulation and if required in a specific way and within a specific period. It follows from Article 58 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation that the Data Inspectorate in in accordance with Article 83 shall impose penalty charges in addition to or in lieu of other corrective measures referred to in Article 58 (2), the circumstances of each individual case. For the purposes of Article 83 (7) of the Data Protection Regulation, national authorities may: rules state that administrative sanctions may be imposed on authorities. According to ch. 6 Section 2 of the Data Protection Act allows for penalty fees to be decided authorities, but to a maximum of SEK 5,000,000 or SEK 10,000,000 depending on whether the infringement concerns articles covered by Article 83 (4) or 83.5 of the Data Protection Regulation. Article 83 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation sets out the factors to be taken into account for to decide whether to impose an administrative penalty fee, but also what is to affect the size of the penalty fee. Of central importance to the assessment of the gravity of the infringement is its nature, severity and duration. In the case of a minor infringement may the regulatory authority, in accordance with recital 148 of the Data Protection Regulation, issue a reprimand instead of imposing a penalty fee. Order The health service has a great need for information in its operations. The It is therefore natural that the possibilities of digitalisation are utilized as much as Page 25 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 2 6 (29) possible in healthcare. Since the Patient Data Act was written, one has a lot extensive digitization has taken place in healthcare. Both the data collections size as the number of people sharing information with each other has increased substantially. At the same time, this increase means that the demands on it increase personal data controller, as the assessment of what is an appropriate safety is affected by the extent of the treatment. In health care, this means a great responsibility for it personal data controller to protect the data from unauthorized access, among other things by having an authorization allocation that is even more comminuted. It is therefore essential that there is a real analysis of the needs based on different activities and different executives. Equally important is that there is an actual analysis of the risks from an integrity perspective may occur in the event of an override of access rights. From this analysis must then be restricted to the individual executive. This authority must then be followed up and changed or restricted accordingly hand that changes in the tasks of the individual executive provide reason for it. The Data Inspectorate's inspection has shown that the Health and Medical Care Board has failed to take appropriate security measures to provide protection to the personal data in the journal system NCS Cross by not complying with the requirements which is set in the Patient Data Act and the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations and thereby does not meet the requirements of Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. Failure includes both the interior the secrecy according to ch. 4 the Patient Data Act as the cohesive one record keeping according to ch. 6 patient data law. The Data Inspectorate therefore submits, with the support of 58.2 d i the Data Protection Ordinance, the Health and Medical Care Board to implement and document the required needs and risk analysis for the NCS medical record system Cross within the framework of both internal secrecy and within the framework of it coherent record keeping. The Health and Medical Care Board shall further, with the support of the needs and risk analysis, assign each user individually authorization for access to personal data limited to what only necessary for the individual to be able to fulfill his duties within Healthcare. Page 26 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 2 7 (29) Penalty fee The Data Inspectorate can state that the violations basically concern the Health and the healthcare board's obligation to take appropriate safety measures for to provide protection for personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. In this case, it is a matter of large collections of data with sensitive personal data and extensive powers. The caregiver needs to be involved necessity to have a comprehensive processing of data on the health of individuals. However, it must not be unrestricted but should be based on what individual employees need to be able to perform their tasks. The Data Inspectorate notes that this is information that includes direct identification of the individual through name, contact information and social security number, health information, but it may also be other private information about for example, family relationships, sexual life and lifestyle. The patient is addicted of receiving care and is thus in a vulnerable situation. The nature of the data, scope and the patients' position of dependence give caregivers a special responsibility to ensure patients' right to adequate protection for their personal data. Additional aggravating circumstances are the treatment of personal data about patients in the main medical record system belongs to the core of a the activities of caregivers, that the treatment covers many patients and the possibility of access refers to a large proportion of the employees. In this case, stir it is about 650,000 number of patients within the framework of the internal confidentiality and about 665,000 patients under it coherent record keeping. Of a total of 84 care units are available restrictions on access to only six units, the so-called protected devices. The Data Inspectorate can also state that the Health and The Health Care Board did not follow the Data Inspectorate's decision of 27 March 2015. The decision was presented to the then County Council Board in Västerbotten County county council to carry out a documented needs and risk analysis accordingly then requirement in ch. 2 Section 6, second paragraph, second sentence SOSFS 2008: 14, which corresponds to the current provision in Chapter 4. 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. This is an aggravating circumstance, in accordance with Article 83 (2) (e) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. Page 27 of 29Datainspektionen DI-2019-3841 2 8 (29) The shortcomings that have now been established have thus been known to Hälso- och the health care board for several years, which means that the action took place intentionally and thus is considered more serious. The Data Inspectorate also notes that the Health and Medical Care Board's information that they analyzes that have subsequently been made are solely based on the business perspective, which is particularly serious. In determining the seriousness of the infringements, it can also be stated that the infringements also cover the basic principles set out in Article 5 (i) the Data Protection Regulation, which is one of the more serious infringements that can provide a higher penalty fee under Article 83 (5) of the Data Protection Regulation. Taken together, these factors mean that they are not to be judged as minor infringements without infringements that should lead to an administrative penalty fee. The Data Inspectorate considers that these violations are closely related to each other. That assessment is based on the need and risk analysis form the basis for the allocation of the authorizations. The Data Inspectorate therefore considers that these infringements are so closely linked that they constitute interconnected data processing within the meaning of Article 83 (3) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate therefore decides on a joint penalty fee for these infringements. The administrative penalty fee shall be effective, proportionate and deterrent. This means that the amount must be determined so that it the administrative penalty fee leads to correction, that it provides a preventive effect and that it is also proportional in relation to both current violations as to the ability of the supervised entity to pay. The maximum amount for the penalty fee in this case is SEK 10 million according to ch. 6 Section 2 of the Act (2018: 218) with supplementary provisions to the EU data protection regulation. Given the seriousness of the infringements and that the administrative the penalty fee must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive the Data Inspectorate determines the administrative sanction fee for Health and Medical Care Board to 2,500,000 (two million five hundred thousand) kronor.

Aleris Sjukvård AB has not carried out a needs and risk analysis before the allocation of permissions takes place in the journal system TakeCare, i in accordance with ch. 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act (2008: 355) and ch. 4 Section 2 The National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations and general advice on record keeping and processing of personal data in health and healthcare (HSLF-FS 2016: 40). This means that Aleris Sjukvård AB have not taken appropriate organizational measures to be able to ensure and be able to show that the processing of personal data has a security that is appropriate in relation to the risks. 2. Aleris Sjukvård AB does not limit users' permissions for access to the TakeCare journal system for what is only needed for that the user should be able to fulfill his tasks in the health and healthcare according to ch. 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act and 4 Cape. 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. This means that Aleris Sjukvård AB does not have taken measures to be able to ensure and be able to show a suitable security of personal data. The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of Articles 58 (2) and 83 i the Data Protection Ordinance to Aleris Sjukvård AB, for violation of Article 5 (1) (f) and (2) and Article 32 (1) and (2) of the Data Protection Regulation; shall pay an administrative penalty fee of 15,000,000 (fifteen million). The Data Inspectorate submits pursuant to Article 58 (2) (d) i data protection ordinance Aleris Sjukvård AB to implement and document required needs and risk analysis for the TakeCare medical record system and that then, based on the needs and risk analysis, assign each user 1 REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on that free flow of such data and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Regulation). Page 2 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 3 (30) individual access to personal data restricted to only what is needed for the individual to be able to fulfill his duties in health care, in accordance with Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) of the Data Protection Ordinance, Chapter 4 § 2 and ch. 6 § 7 the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. Report on the supervisory matter The Data Inspectorate's inspection began with an inspection letter on 22 March 2019 and has taken place both in writing and through on-site inspection on April 8 2019. The audit has been intended to control whether Aleris Sjukvård AB's (hereinafter referred to as Aleris) decision on the allocation of authorizations has been preceded by a need and risk analysis. The supervision has also included how Aleris has granted authorizations for access to the TakeCare master journal system, and which access opportunities the granted privileges provide within both the framework of the internal secrecy according to ch. the Patient Data Act, as the cohesive one record keeping according to ch. 6 patient data law. In addition to this has The Data Inspectorate examined which documentation of access (logs) as is in the journal system. The Data Inspectorate has only examined the user's access to the journal system, i.e. what care documentation the user can actually take part of and read. The supervision has not included which functions were included in the competence, ie. what the user can actually do in the journal system (eg issuing prescriptions, writing referrals, etc.). The inspection is one of several inspections within the framework of a self-initiated supervisory project at the Swedish Data Inspectorate, where i.a. Karolinska The university hospital has been included. Due to what has emerged about Aleri's view on the technical possibilities to limit readability for its users in TakeCare, Aleris was asked in particular comment on an opinion from Karolinska University Hospital, which also uses TakeCare, where the technical possibilities regarding TakeCare was described. What has emerged in the case Aleris has essentially stated the following. Page 3 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 4 (30) Personal data responsibility Aleris is the care provider and personal data manager. The business Aleri's ownership structure has changed after the Data Inspectorate's review initiated. Aleris 'new ownership structure is shown in Aleris' supplement from 16 November 2020. The supplement states, among other things, the following. Aleris has been part of the newly formed Group Parent Company since October 1, 2019, Aleris Group AB (corporate identity number 559210-7550), and is a subsidiary of Aleris Healthcare AB (org.nr. 556598–6782). Aleris Group AB is owned by Triton. Group sales for Aleris Group AB amounted to SEK 1,215,385,000 between October 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019. Since Aleris Group AB was formed in connection with the change of ownership when Aleris Healthcare AB joined subsidiaries were acquired, only turnover figures are available for this period. The annual turnover for Aleris Healthcare AB amounted to SEK 30,223,866 during 2019. Journal system Aleris has been using TakeCare as its main record system since 28 May 2012 for internal secrecy and within the framework of the cohesive record keeping. Federation Collaboration TakeCare (FSTC) is the customer of the medical record system TakeCare and CompuGroup Medical (CGM) are suppliers of the medical record system and is responsible for the functions that the system has to control permissions. All functions in the journal system are created by CGM, but it is Aleris who chooses which functions a certain staff category should have access to among the functions that are entered. Aleris has no technical possibilities to do changes in TakeCare because Aleris has no control over the journal system. Aleris is only a user of the system. Aleris has not been able to make any demands on CGM in the procurement of the journal system. The company has, for example, pointed out that there have been problems with the record system consisting of, as far as the allocation of competences is concerned, that Page 4 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 5 (30) the system cannot separate read and print permissions for a read function. CGM has not been interested in changing this despite comments from Aleris. It is FSTC that can order changes to the functions and that is then up to CGM if they want to make the changes or not. Aleris has one representative in FSTC who can express Aleri's wishes. However, Aleris has not received some hearing for the company's views. Number of patients and employees Aleris had 796,350 unique patients in TakeCare as of May 20, 2019. How however, many of those who died could not be retrieved. In May 2019, there were 1,058 active users, 807 active accounts and 63 units in the journal system TakeCare. The number of active users (ie employees and consultants who may have access to TakeCare) have been calculated by calculate the number of active AD accounts at relevant cost centers. Internal secrecy Aleris has essentially stated the following. Needs and risk analysis Aleris has stated that needs and risk analyzes aimed at TakeCare are performed by a designated risk analysis team for the purpose of reviewing the applicable authorization allocation and possibly determine new conditions for granting eligibility. Permissions is always limited to what is needed for the employee to be able to perform their work and contribute to safe care. The need versus the risk of improperness access is always weighed against each other before permissions are granted. General authorization profiles are available, specific authorizations are assigned if necessary. The later examined in particular in the subsequent analysis of the designated risk analysis team. What What is especially considered are the risks that can arise if an employee has too broad eligibility versus too low eligibility and thus not access to relevant patient information. The result from the needs and risk analysis is then the basis for selecting the authorization profile used in the assignment of competencies within Aleris. Eligibility for TakeCare is ordered by the responsible manager, as stated in the document, “TakeCare Authorization Management”. The document also states that the competence is personal and that its scope is based on Page 5 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 6 (30) the user's professional role and organizational domicile. Furthermore, it appears that the care provider must ensure that the authority for access to patient data limited to what a user needs to be able to perform their tasks in health care. Aleris has a document called ""Needs and Risk Analysis-TakeCare"". The document has looked like it does today since May 28, 2012 when TakeCare was introduced and applies both to internal secrecy and within its framework coherent record keeping. The document shows the different profiles, so-called authority groups. The document shows, among other things the reading rights and the writing rights for each authority group. All profiles except technicians have been granted read access to the data in TakeCare. The eligibility for each group has been justified. The doctors are going to examples be able to perform their duties and are responsible for patient information, while the system administrator must be able to troubleshoot, manage and set up users, systems and local administrators. Under the heading ""Risk of restricted access"" it is stated that the user ""cannot perform their duties in full ”. This justification is stated for all profiles (except for the local administrators where the motivation is “Can not manage permissions and implement corrective actions ”). During The heading “Risk of extensive access” states, among other things, that “There is one risk of disclosure of patient information '. Similar justification is given for everyone profiles. Authorization of access to personal data about patients Aleris has stated that it is the system administrator who has the highest the level of competence, ie full authorization, in TakeCare. The local the administrator has access to his own device and is the one who assigns permissions within the device. What privileges an administrator imposes a user depends on the business to which the user belongs and on the user's tasks. All users get the “minimum they should have to cope ”in terms of accessibility. Access can, however expanded if necessary. There are basic profiles for, for example, assistant nurses, who are given the qualifications needed to carry out their duties tasks. If the manager considers that the assistant nurses need one extended privileges, local administrators ensure that privileges ""Hangs up"" the basic profile. If the extended authorization is not needed, it can be taken away from the basic profile. Page 6 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 7 (30) Aleris has stated that all accounts within Aleris are individual and that authorizations are granted on the basis of the document, ‘Needs and risk analysis TakeCare ”. As previously mentioned, it appears from the document that everyone professional profiles in addition to technicians have been granted reading access to the data in TakeCare. However, Aleris has stated that all users have different read permissions in the journal system based on which system functions they have access to Aleris. According to Aleris, it is possible to steer away access opportunities to TakeCare by giving different staff access to different functions. Each staff category only gets access to the functions they need for to be able to perform their work. Technicians, for example, have limited qualifications depending on what they are going to do in the system. They only get reading permission if they need it in their work. Another example concerns users who only will be at the checkout and thus do not need a reading license. There is no staff that only has the task of managing the cash register the current situation. By choosing different functions for different users, a difference is made in what different users can do in the system, e.g. as regards verify, sign, etc. In total, there are 640 different system functions that you can choose to provide authority to. Among these features, Aleris has selected the features that different staff categories need to have access to in order to operate safely patient work. The document ""Profiles and permissions"" shows the different ones permissions that each category of staff has been assigned in TakeCare, e.g. dictate audio files, read activities, sign, read emergency information, read journal text, vidimering, read referral, administer drug prescription, read scanned documents and approve care sessions. The document states, among other things that all profiles ie. doctors, nurses, assistant nurses, paramedics, secretaries, ""administrative"", students and ""Receptionist Rehab ""has the authority to"" read journal text ""and that everyone except ""Receptionist Rehab"" is authorized to ""read scanned documents"" in TakeCare. It also appears that only doctors are authorized to “read emergency tasks ”and that all profiles except assistant nurse and ""Administrative"" can ""read diagnoses"" in TakeCare. Aleris has stated that the starting point is that one user on one device only has read access to the patient records available on the device. One users who need to read journal entries from another device must Page 7 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 8 (30) make an active choice in the system. By active choices is meant that the user is allowed to do a number of ""clicks"" and select the current device (this function is called journal filter). Authorization to be able to use the journal filter is given to them users who need this to be able to perform their work. The user can never accidentally read one patient record from another unit. Aleris has stated that there are features in TakeCare to a caregiver should be able to ""isolate"" one care unit and thereby ""shut out"" others caregivers 'and care units' access possibilities to the unit's care documentation, so-called protected units. However, Aleris does not operate any activity that requires protected devices and has therefore not used of this function. Coherent record keeping Aleris has essentially stated the following. Needs and risk analysis The document “Needs and risk analysis - TakeCare” also applies to the system for coherent record keeping. Authorization of access to personal data about patients The allocation of authority takes place in the same way as within the framework of the internal secrecy. Within the framework of coherent record keeping in TakeCare, users can take part of all care documentation with other care providers included in the system. The user can initially see if a patient is current with other care providers, but not which. To be able to see who these caregivers are, the user must click on in the system, ie. make active choices. The user must then click in the box ""consent"" or ""emergency access"" to access it specific caregiver records. Aleris has stated the following due to Karolinska The University Hospital in a statement has stated that there are opportunities to restrict access in TakeCare. There is a function to ""isolate"" a care unit and thereby close access to other care providers and care units (so-called Page 8 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 9 (30) protected devices). A care provider can thus from a technical perspective restrict other care providers' access to their own care documentation. However, Aleris has assessed that the company does not conduct any business as need to be blocked and that it is more patient safe to let the patient information at Aleri's units be available to other care providers. According to Aleris, it is moreover, not allowed to implement such restrictions if one caregivers use the TakeCare medical record system and at the same time are part of coherent record keeping. This following a decision from the Stockholm Region. The means that all users of Aleris have access to all patient data at the other care providers in TakeCare, except when patients have requested to get their information blocked (a so-called caregiver block). According to Aleris, from a patient safety perspective, this is not practically possible to opt out of individual care providers' access to their own care documentation in TakeCare (except for protected devices). Either is the caregiver included in the system for coherent record keeping or not. It is not possible to restrict access for competent persons to the information of other care providers and at the same time in a meaningful way participate in coherent record keeping. According to Aleris, it is not possible to determine in advance which data are in one certain cases may be important for patient-safe care. Aleris has therefore decided not to actively block other caregivers' records. However, such as mentioned, a caregiver himself blocks other caregivers' access to TakeCare there these have made the assessment that their patients' medical records should not be available to other caregivers. These devices are marked in TakeCare with an asterisk. In this way, a selection of care units has already been made Aleri's staff do not have access to. Documentation of access (logs) Aleri's log documentation states, among other things: the user's and patient's identity, care unit, date, time, information to the user has documented in the journal during the last 18 months as well as information that the patient has had contact with the care unit during the last 18 months. Aleris has the ability to perform targeted log checks. That means Aleris can see exactly what a user has done in the system. About the patient or Aleris suspects data breaches, Aleris can also perform an in-depth log check. Page 9 of 30Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3844 1 0 (30) Also all activities that take place within the framework of coherent record keeping logged in the system. It also means that all active selections are logged in the system. If the user, for example, has selected ""consent"" or ""emergency access"" to be able to take part of a patient's information to another care provider, this will be appear from the log documentation. Aleri's opinion on the Data Inspectorate's letter Aleris has in comments on the letter Final communication before decision as received by the Swedish Data Inspectorate on 20 March 2020 stated the following, among other things. The Data Inspectorate should take into account the figures for the economic unit where they The alleged shortcomings have taken place, ie Aleris Sjukvård AB. Aleris has actively worked to continuously strengthen the interior and exterior confidentiality, including the functionality of TakeCare. When Aleris took over adequate measures to strengthen, through FSTC, the integrity of TakeCare actual deficiencies in TakeCare should not be considered to be Aleris' fault. Justification of decision Applicable rules The Data Protection Regulation is the primary source of law The Data Protection Regulation, often abbreviated GDPR, was introduced on 25 May 2018 and is the primary legal regulation in the processing of personal data. This also applies to health care. The basic principles for the processing of personal data are set out in Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation. A basic principle is the requirement security pursuant to Article 5 (1) (f), which states that personal data shall be processed in a way that ensures adequate security for personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unauthorized treatment and against loss, destruction or damage by accident, using appropriate technical or organizational measures. Article 5 (2) states the so-called liability, ie. that it “Personal data controllers must be responsible for and be able to show that they the basic principles of paragraph 1 are complied with "". Page 10 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 1 1 (30) Article 24 deals with the responsibility of the controller. Of Article 24 (1) it appears that the person responsible for personal data is responsible for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate that the processing is performed in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. The measures shall carried out taking into account the nature, scope, context of the treatment and purposes and the risks, of varying degrees of probability and severity, for freedoms and rights of natural persons. The measures must be reviewed and updated if necessary. Article 32 regulates the security associated with the processing. According to paragraph 1 the personal data controller and the personal data assistant shall take into account of the latest developments, implementation costs and treatment nature, scope, context and purpose as well as the risks, of varying probability and seriousness, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons shall the personal data controller and the personal data assistant take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security which is appropriate in relation to the risk (…). According to paragraph 2, at the assessment of the appropriate level of safety, special consideration shall be given to the risks involved the treatment entails, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or to unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data transferred, stored or otherwise processed. Recital 75 states that in assessing the risk to natural persons rights and freedoms, various factors must be taken into account. Among other things mentioned personal data covered by professional secrecy, health data or sexual life, if the processing of personal data concerning vulnerable physical persons takes place persons, especially children, or if the treatment involves a large number personal data and applies to a large number of registered persons. Furthermore, it follows from recital 76 that the probable and serious risk of it data subjects' rights and freedoms should be determined on the basis of processing nature, scope, context and purpose. The risk should be evaluated on on the basis of an objective assessment, which determines whether the data processing involves a risk or a high risk. Recitals 39 and 83 also contain writings that provide guidance on it the meaning of the data protection regulation's requirements for security in Processing of personal data. Page 11 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 1 2 (30) The Data Protection Regulation and the relationship with complementary national provisions According to Article 5 (1). a in the Data Protection Regulation, the personal data shall treated in a lawful manner. In order for the treatment to be considered legal, it is required legal basis by fulfilling at least one of the conditions of Article 6 (1). The provision of health care is one such task of general interest referred to in Article 6 (1) (e). In health care, the legal bases can also be legal obligation pursuant to Article 6 (1) (c) and exercise of authority under Article 6 (1) (e) updated. When it comes to the legal bases legal obligation, in general interest or exercise of authority by the Member States, in accordance with Article 6.2, maintain or introduce more specific provisions for adaptation the application of the provisions of the Regulation to national circumstances. National law may specify specific requirements for the processing of data and other measures to ensure legal and equitable treatment. But there is not only one possibility to introduce national rules but also one duty; Article 6 (3) states that the basis for the treatment referred to in paragraph 1 (c) and (e) shall be determined in accordance with Union law or national law of the Member States. The legal basis may also include specific provisions to adapt the application of the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation. Union law or the national law of the Member States law must fulfill an objective of general interest and be proportionate to it legitimate goals pursued. Article 9 states that the treatment of specific categories of personal data (so-called sensitive personal data) is prohibited. Sensitive personal data includes data on health. Article 9 (2) states except when sensitive personal data may still be processed. Article 9 (2) (h) states that the processing of sensitive personal data may be repeated the treatment is necessary for reasons related to, among other things the provision of health care on the basis of Union law or national law of the Member States or in accordance with agreements with professionals in the field of health and provided that the conditions and protective measures provided for in referred to in paragraph 3 are met. Article 9 (3) imposes a regulated duty of confidentiality. Page 12 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 1 3 (30) This means that both the legal bases of general interest, exercise of authority and legal obligation in the treatment of the vulnerable personal data under the exemption in Article 9 (2) (h) supplementary rules. Supplementary national regulations In the case of Sweden, both the basis for the treatment and those special conditions for the processing of personal data in the field of health and healthcare regulated in the Patient Data Act (2008: 355) and the Patient Data Ordinance (2008: 360). I 1 kap. Section 4 of the Patient Data Act states that the law complements the data protection regulation. The purpose of the Patient Data Act is to provide information in health and healthcare must be organized so as to meet patient safety and good quality and promotes cost efficiency. Its purpose is also to personal data shall be designed and otherwise processed so that patients and the privacy of other data subjects is respected. In addition, must be documented personal data is handled and stored so that unauthorized persons do not have access to it them (Chapter 1, Section 2 of the Patient Data Act). The supplementary provisions in the Patient Data Act aim to: take care of both privacy protection and patient safety. The legislator has thus through the regulation made a balance as to how the information must be processed to meet both the requirements for patient safety as the right to privacy in the processing of personal data. The National Board of Health and Welfare has, with the support of the Patient Data Ordinance, issued regulations and general advice on record keeping and processing of personal data in health care (HSLF-FS 2016: 40). The regulations constitute such supplementary rules, which shall be applied in the care provider's treatment of personal data in health care, see chap. Section 1 of the Patient Data Act. National provisions supplementing the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation safety can be found in Chapters 4 and 6. the Patient Data Act and Chapters 3 and 4 HSLF-FS 2016: 40. Requirement to make a needs and risk analysis Page 13 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 1 4 (30) According to ch. 4, the care provider must § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40 make a needs and risk analysis, before the allocation of authorizations in the system takes place. That the analysis requires both the needs and the risks is clear from the preparatory work to the Patient Data Act, prop. 2007/08: 126 pp. 148-149, as follows. Authorization for staff's electronic access to patient information shall be restricted to what the executive needs to be able to perform his duties in health and healthcare. This includes that authorizations must be followed up and changed or restricted accordingly hand as changes in the tasks of the individual executive give rise to it. The provision corresponds in principle to section 8 of the Health Care Register Act. The purpose of the provision is to imprint the obligation of the responsible caregiver to make active and individual eligibility assignments based on analyzes of which details are different staff categories and different types of activities need. But it's not just needed needs analyzes. Risk analyzes must also be done where different types of risks are taken into account, such as may be associated with an overly availability of certain types of information. Protected personal data that is classified, information about publicly known persons, data from certain clinics or medical specialties are examples of categories such as may require special risk assessments. In general, it can be said that the more comprehensive an information system is, the greater the amount there must be different levels of authorization. Decisive for decisions on eligibility for e.g. various categories of healthcare professionals for electronic access to data in patient records should be that the authority should be limited to what the executive needs for the purpose a good and safe patient care. A more extensive or coarse-meshed competence allocation should - even if it has points from the point of view of efficiency - is considered an unjustified dissemination of journal information within a business and should as such not accepted. Furthermore, data should be stored in different layers so that more sensitive data require active choices or otherwise not as easily accessible to staff as less sensitive tasks. When it applies to personnel who work with business follow-up, statistics production, central financial administration and similar activities that are not individual-oriented, it should be most executives have enough access to information that can only be indirectly derived to individual patients. Electronic access to code keys, social security numbers and others data that directly point out individual patients should be able to be strong in this area limited to individuals. Internal secrecy The provisions in ch. 4 The Patient Data Act concerns internal confidentiality, ie. regulates how privacy protection is to be handled within a care provider's business and in particular employees' opportunities to prepare for access to personal data that is electronically available in a healthcare provider organisation. Page 14 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 1 5 (30) It appears from ch. Section 2 of the Patient Data Act, that the care provider shall decide conditions for granting access to such data patients who are fully or partially automated. Such authorization shall limited to what is needed for the individual to be able to fulfill theirs tasks in health care. Of ch. 4 § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40 follows that the care provider shall be responsible for each users are assigned an individual privilege to access personal data. The caregiver's decision on the allocation of eligibility shall preceded by a needs and risk analysis. Coherent record keeping The provisions in ch. 6 the Patient Data Act concerns cohesive record keeping, which means that a care provider - under the conditions specified in § 2 the same chapter of that law - may have direct access to personal data that is processed by other care providers for purposes related to care documentation. The access to information is provided by a healthcare provider making the information about a patient which the care provider registers if the patient is available to other care providers which participates in the cohesive record keeping system (see Bill 2007/08: 126 p. 247). Of ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act follows that the provisions in Chapter 4 §§ 2 and 3 - also applies to authorization allocation and access control at cohesion record keeping. The requirement that the care provider must perform a needs and risk analysis before the allocation of permissions in the system takes place, thus also applies in systems for coherent record keeping. Documentation of access (logs) Of ch. 4 Section 3 of the Patient Data Act states that a care provider must ensure that access to such data on patients who are kept in whole or in part automatically documented and systematically checked. According to ch. 4 Section 9 HSLF-FS 2016: 40, the care provider shall be responsible for that 1. it appears from the documentation of the access (logs) which measures taken with information on a patient, 2. it appears from the logs at which care unit or care process measures have been taken, 3. the logs indicate the time at which the measures were taken; 4. the identity of the user and the patient is stated in the logs. Page 15 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 1 6 (30) The Data Inspectorate's assessment Personal data controller's responsibility for security As previously described, Article 24 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation provides a general requirement for the personal data controller to take appropriate technical and organizational measures. The requirement is partly to ensure that the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with the Data Protection Ordinance, and that the data controller must be able to demonstrate that the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. The safety associated with the treatment is regulated more specifically in the articles 5.1 f and 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. Article 32 (1) states that the appropriate measures shall be both technical and organizational and they must ensure a level of security that is appropriate in in relation to the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons which the treatment entails. It is therefore necessary to identify the possible ones the risks to the data subjects' rights and freedoms and assess the probability of the risks occurring and the severity if they occur. What is appropriate varies not only in relation to the risks but also based on the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment. It has thus the significance of what personal data is processed, how many data, it is a question of how many people process the data, etc. The health service has a great need for information in its operations. It is therefore natural that the possibilities of digitalisation are utilized so much as possible in healthcare. Since the Patient Data Act was written, one has a lot extensive digitization has taken place in healthcare. Both the data collections size as the number of people sharing information with each other has increased substantially. At the same time, this increase means that the demands on it increase personal data controller, as the assessment of what is an appropriate safety is affected by the extent of the treatment. It is also a question of sensitive personal data and the data concerns people who are in a situation of dependence when they are in need of care. It is also often a question of a lot of personal information about each of these people and that the data over time may be processed by very Page 16 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 1 7 (30) many people in healthcare. All in all, this places great demands on it personal data controllers. The data processed must be protected from outside actors as well the business as against unauthorized access from within the business. It can It should be noted that Article 32 (2) states that the controller, at assessment of the appropriate level of safety, in particular taking into account the risks of unintentional or unlawful destruction, loss or unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access. To be able to know what is an unauthorized access must the data controller must be clear about what an authorized access is. Needs and risk analysis I 4 kap. Section 2 of the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations (HSLF-FS 2016: 40), which supplement the Patient Data Act, it is stated that the care provider must make a needs and risk analysis before the allocation of authorizations in the system takes place. This means that national law prescribes requirements for an appropriate organizational measure that shall: taken before the allocation of authorizations to journal systems takes place. A needs and risk analysis must include an analysis of the needs and a analysis of the risks from an integrity perspective that may be associated with an overly allotment of access to personal data about patients. Both the needs and the risks must be assessed on the basis of them tasks that need to be processed in the business, what processes it is the question of whether and what risks to the privacy of the individual exist. The assessments of the risks need to be made on the basis of organizational level, there for example, a certain business part or task may be more privacy sensitive than another, but also based on the individual level, if it is the issue of special circumstances that need to be taken into account, such as that it is a question of protected personal data, publicly known persons or otherwise particularly vulnerable persons. The size of the system also affects the risk assessment. The preparatory work for the Patient Data Act shows that the more comprehensive an information system is, the greater the variety eligibility levels must exist (Bill 2007/08: 126 p. 149). It is thus the question of a strategic analysis at the strategic level, which should provide one authorization structure that is adapted to the business and this must be maintained updated. In summary, the regulation requires that the risk analysis identifies  different categories of tasks, Page 17 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 1 8 (30) Categories of data subjects (eg vulnerable natural persons and children), or  the scope (eg number of personal data and registered)  negative consequences for data subjects (eg injuries, significant social or economic disadvantage, deprivation of rights and freedoms), and how they affect the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons Processing of personal data. This applies both within internal secrecy as in coherent record keeping. The risk analysis must also include special risk assessments, for example based on whether there is protected personal data that is classified, information on public figures, information from certain clinics or medical specialties (Bill 2007/08: 126 p. 148- 149). The risk analysis must also include an assessment of how probable and serious the risk to the data subjects' rights and freedoms is based on the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment (recital 76). It is thus through the needs and risk analysis that it personal data controller finds out who needs access, which information the accessibility shall include, at what times and at what context access is needed, while analyzing the risks to it the freedoms and rights of the individual that the treatment may lead to. The result should then lead to the technical and organizational measures needed to ensure that no one other than the one who needs and the risk analysis shows that it should be justified. When a needs and risk analysis is missing prior to the allocation of qualifications in system, lacks the basis for the personal data controller on a legal be able to assign their users a correct authorization. The the data controller is responsible for, and shall have control over, the personal data processing that takes place within the framework of the business. To assign users a when accessing journal system, without this being founded on a performed needs and risk analysis, means that the person responsible for personal data does not have sufficient control over the personal data processing that takes place in Page 18 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 1 9 (30) the journal system and also can not show that he has the control that required. Aleris has stated that the authorizations are granted on the basis of the document, “ and risk analysis-TakeCare ”. The document states that all authorization profiles in addition to technicians have been assigned permission to read in the system, and that the risk with restricted access is that the user cannot perform his tasks in full. This justification is stated for all users. It is further stated that the only risk in the event of extensive access is to the user sees information that he / she does not have the right to see which may involve disclosure of patient information. Similar justification is given for all profiles. The means that Aleris makes the same assessment for all profiles regardless the user's task and needs. The Data Inspectorate can state that the document, “Needs and risk analysis TakeCare ”does not contain any analysis of the different profiles' needs access to patients' data. Aleris has only stated what respectively profile ""must be able to perform"" in the journal system and thus not analyzed which information as it is a question of or what the needs look like in the various the business components and for different professional roles. The document also lacks one analysis of the risks to the individual's freedoms and rights as an excessive eligibility may entail. The needs and risk analysis must be done in a strategic manner level that should provide an authorization structure that is adapted to the business. The information in the document ""Needs and risk analysis - TakeCare"" is too deficient in relation to the information required for a correct needs and risk analysis must be able to be performed. As stated above, in a needs and risk analysis both the needs and the risks are assessed on the basis of them tasks that need to be processed in the business, what processes it is the question of whether and what risks to the individual's integrity exist as well organizational as well as individual level. In its analysis, Aleris has not taken into account the negative consequences for registered, different categories of data, categories of registered or the extent of the number of personal data and registered affects the risk of the rights and freedoms of natural persons in the treatment of Aleris by personal information in TakeCare. There are also no special risk assessments based on whether there is, for example, protected personal data that is classified, information on public figures, information from Page 19 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 2 0 (30) certain clinics or medical specialties or other factors such as requires special protective measures. There is also no assessment of how probable and serious risk to the data subjects' rights and freedoms is considered to be. In the light of the above, the Data Inspectorate can state that the document “Needs and risk analysis- TakeCare” does not meet the requirements put on a needs and risk analysis and that Aleris has not been able to show that the company has carried out a needs and risk analysis within the meaning of 4 Cape. § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40, neither within the framework of internal secrecy according to ch. 4 the Patient Data Act or within the framework of the cohesive record keeping according to ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act. That means Aleris does not have taken appropriate organizational measures in accordance with Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) in order to ensure and, in accordance with Article 5 (2), be able to show that the processing of personal data has a security that is appropriate in relation to the risks. Authorization of access to personal data about patients As reported above, a caregiver may have a legitimate interest in having a comprehensive processing of data on the health of individuals. Notwithstanding this shall access to personal data about patients may be limited to what is needed for the individual to be able to fulfill his or her duties. With regard to the allocation of authorization for electronic access according to ch. § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act states that in the preparatory work, Bill. 2007/08: 126 pp. 148-149, i.a. that there should be different eligibility categories in the journal system and that the permissions should be limited to what the user need to provide the patient with good and safe care. It also appears that “a more extensive or coarse-grained eligibility should be considered as one unauthorized dissemination of journal information within a business and should as such is not accepted. "" In health care, it is the person who needs the information in their work who may be authorized to access them. This applies both within a caregivers as between caregivers. It is, as already mentioned, through the needs and risk analysis that the person responsible for personal data finds out who who need access, what information the access should include, at which times and in which contexts access is needed, and at the same time analyzes the risks to the individual's freedoms and rights Page 20 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 2 1 (30) the treatment can lead to. The result should then lead to the technical and organizational measures needed to ensure no allocation of eligibility provides further access opportunities than the one that needs and the risk analysis shows is justified. An important organizational measure is to provide instruction to those who have the authority to assign authorizations on how this should go to and what should be considered so that it, with the needs and risk analysis as a basis, becomes a correct authorization allocation in each individual case. Aleris has stated that there are restrictions regarding users access options in TakeCare then the company by choosing different functions for different users can steer away users' access capabilities in the journal system. According to Aleris, all users have different read permissions in the journal system depending on the system features they have access to. Of the document However, “Needs and risk analysis - TakeCare” states that all professional profiles in addition to technicians, read access has been assigned to the tasks in TakeCare. Furthermore, the document ""Profiles and Permissions"" states that all occupational profiles, ie. doctors, nurses, assistant nurses, paramedics, secretary, administrative, student and receptionist Rehab has authority to ""read journal text"". This means that virtually all professional profiles has access to Aleri's personal data about patients in TakeCare. The limitation that has been introduced is that different professional profiles have different reading privileges, for example, doctors, nurses, paramedics can read diagnoses ”or“ read prescriptions ”while other professional profiles, for example ""Administratively"" do not have those powers. It also appears that doctors are the only ones who have the authority to ""read emergency information"". The Data Inspectorate considers it positive that Aleris has allocated different read permissions in the system, but that it is not enough because all professional profiles still have access to the journal texts in TakeCare. In addition, the division is rough as it is only a division from the outside occupational categories and not based on, for example, which organizational affiliation, which tasks the user has or which patients personal data that the user needs to access at different times to. Because different users have different tasks within different work areas, users need access to personal data about patients in TakeCare are limited to reflect this. Page 21 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 2 2 (30) Against this background, the Data Inspectorate can state that Aleris does not have restricted users 'permissions to access patients' personal data in the journal system TakeCare. This in turn means that one majority of the users have had actual access to the care documentation about a large number of patients in TakeCare. The review also shows that Aleris uses so-called active choices for access to personal data about patients and the record filter function. The fact that Aleris uses active choices does not mean that the access option to personal data in the system has been restricted to the user, without the data are still electronically accessible. This means that the active choices are not such an access restriction as referred to in ch. 4 Section 2 of the Patient Data Act, as this provision requires that jurisdiction be limited to what necessary for the individual to be able to fulfill his duties within health care and that only those who need the information should have access. The Data Inspectorate thus considers that Aleri's use of active choices is an integrity enhancing measure but that it does not affect the actual access possibilities. Aleris has further stated that there are features in TakeCare for that one care providers must be able to ""isolate"" a care unit and thereby ""shut out"" other care providers 'and care units' access to the unit care documentation, so-called protected units. However, Aleris believes that the company does not conduct any business that requires protected entities and have therefore not used this function. As for the unified record keeping, all users at Aleris have access to all personal data about patients at the other care providers in TakeCare, except when patients have requested that their data be blocked. It appears from the review that the care provider has an opportunity to actively block the records of other caregivers, but that Aleris has chosen not to do so because the company does not conduct any business that needs to be blocked. Aleris considers it safer to leave the data at Aleri's units available to other caregivers. That the allocation of authorizations has not been preceded by a need and risk analysis means that Aleris has not analyzed users' needs for access to the data, the risks that such access may entail and Page 22 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 2 3 (30) thus also not identifying which access is justified for the users based on such an analysis. Aleris has thus not used suitable measures, in accordance with Article 32, to restrict users' access to patients' data in the medical record system. This in turn has meant that there has been a risk of unauthorized access and unauthorized distribution of personal data partly within the framework of internal secrecy, partly within the framework for the unified record keeping. Aleris has further stated that the company has no technical possibilities to make changes to TakeCare because Aleris has no control over it the journal system. It also appears that Aleris, within the framework of it coherent record keeping, may not implement certain restrictions with reference to a decision from the Stockholm Region. The basis of the Data Protection Ordinance is that the person responsible for personal data has a responsibility to comply with the obligations set out in the Regulation in order to: be allowed to process personal data in their activities at all. To take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an appropriate security is such an obligation (see Articles 5, 24 and 32 of the Data Protection Regulation). The Data Inspectorate thus considers that Aleris in capacity as personal data controller can not waive the responsibility to take the technical and organizational measures required by the above articles. In light of the above, the Swedish Data Inspectorate can state that Aleris has processed personal data in breach of Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and 32.2 of the Data Protection Regulation in that Aleris has not restricted users' permissions for accessing the TakeCare journal system to what which is only needed for the user to be able to fulfill his tasks in health care according to ch. 4 § 2 and ch. 6 § 7 the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. That means Aleris does not have taken steps to ensure and, in accordance with Article 5 (2) (i) the Data Protection Regulation, be able to demonstrate appropriate security for personal data. Documentation of access (logs) Of the documentation of access (logs) that arose due to The Data Inspectorate's inspection is as follows: date, time, the identity of the user and the patient, the measures taken and Page 23 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 2 4 (30) care unit. The same documentation appears when the user takes part tasks within the framework of coherent record keeping. The Data Inspectorate has nothing to recall in this part, because the documentation of the access (logs) in TakeCare is in accordance with the requirements set out in Chapter 4. 9 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. Aleris has thus have taken appropriate technical measures in accordance with Article 32 i the Data Protection Regulation. Choice of intervention Legal regulation If there has been a violation of the Data Protection Regulation The Data Inspectorate a number of corrective powers available under the article 58.2 a-j of the Data Protection Regulation. The supervisory authority can, among other things instruct the data controller to ensure that the processing takes place in in accordance with the Regulation and if required in a specific way and within a specific period. It follows from Article 58 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation that the Data Inspectorate in in accordance with Article 83 shall impose penalty charges in addition to or in lieu of other corrective measures referred to in Article 58 (2), the circumstances of each individual case. Article 83 (2) sets out the factors to be taken into account in determining whether a administrative penalty fee shall be imposed, but also what shall affect the size of the penalty fee. Of central importance for the assessment of the seriousness of the infringement is its nature, severity and duration. If in the case of a minor infringement, the supervisory authority may, according to recitals 148 of the Data Protection Regulation, issue a reprimand instead of imposing one penalty fee. Order The health service has a great need for information in its operations. The It is therefore natural that the possibilities of digitalisation are utilized as much as possible in healthcare. Since the Patient Data Act was written, one has a lot extensive digitization has taken place in healthcare. Both the data collections size as the number of people sharing information with each other has increased substantially. At the same time, this increase means that the demands on it increase Page 24 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 2 5 (30) personal data controller, as the assessment of what is an appropriate safety is affected by the extent of the treatment. In this context, it means that a great deal of responsibility rests on it personal data controller to protect the data from unauthorized access, among other things by having an authorization allocation that is even more comminuted. It is therefore essential that there is a real analysis of the needs based on different activities and different executives. Equally important is that there is an actual analysis of the risks from an integrity perspective may occur in the event of an override of access rights. From this analysis must then restrict the access of the individual executive. This authority must then be followed up and changed or restricted accordingly hand that changes in the tasks of the individual executive provide reason for it. The Data Inspectorate's inspection has shown that Aleris has failed to take appropriate action security measures to provide protection for the personal data in the record system TakeCare by not complying with the requirements set out in the Patient Data Act and The National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations regarding the implementation of needs and risk analysis, before the allocation of authorizations in the system takes place and that not restrict the right of access to what is needed to the individual must be able to fulfill their duties in health care. The means that Aleris has also failed to comply with the requirements of Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32.1 and 32.2 of the Data Protection Regulation. Failure includes it as well internal secrecy according to ch. 4 the Patient Data Act as the cohesive one record keeping according to ch. 6 patient data law. The Data Inspectorate therefore submits pursuant to Article 58 (2) (d) i data protection ordinance Aleris Sjukvård AB to implement and document required needs and risk analysis for the TakeCare medical record system and that then, based on the needs and risk analysis, assign each user individual access to personal data restricted to only what is needed for the individual to be able to fulfill his duties in health care, in accordance with Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) of the Data Protection Ordinance, Chapter 4 § 2 and ch. 6 § 7 the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. Penalty fee Page 25 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 2 6 (30) The Data Inspectorate can state that the infringements basically concern Aleris obligation to take appropriate security measures to provide protection to personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. In this case, it is a matter of large data collections with sensitive personal data and extensive powers. The caregiver needs to be involved necessity to have a comprehensive processing of data on the health of individuals. However, it must not be unrestricted but should be based on what individual employees need to be able to perform their tasks. The Data Inspectorate notes that this is information that includes direct identification by the individual through both name, contact information and social security number, health information, but it may also be other private information about for example, family relationships, sexual life and lifestyle. The patient is addicted of receiving care and is thus in a vulnerable situation. The nature of the data, scope and the patients' position of dependence give caregivers a special responsibility to ensure patients' right to adequate protection for their personal data. Additional aggravating circumstances are the treatment of personal data about patients in the main medical record system belongs to the core of a the activities of caregivers, that the treatment covers many patients and the possibility of access refers to a large proportion of the employees. In this case, stir there are almost 800,000 patients and just over 1,000 active users in the journal system. It is a central task for the person responsible for personal data to take measures to ensure an appropriate level of safety in relation to the risk. At the assessment of the appropriate level of safety, special consideration shall be given to those risks which the treatment entails, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or to unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data transferred, stored or otherwise processed, pursuant to Article 32 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation. The requirements for health and the healthcare area, regarding current security measures, has been specified in the Patient Data Act and in the National Board of Health and Welfare regulations. Of the preparatory work for The Patient Data Act clearly states that requirements are placed on both strategic analysis and that eligibility is assigned individually and adapted to the current one the situation. That large amounts of sensitive personal data are processed without basic regulations in the field are followed means that the procedure is assessed as more serious. Page 26 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 2 7 (30) The Data Inspectorate also takes into account that Aleris has not chosen to restrict access in the context of coherent record keeping. According to Aleris is it more patient safe to leave the data at Aleri's units available to other caregivers. This means that Aleris has given priority away the protection of privacy within the coherent record keeping in favor of patient safety, which is particularly serious. The Data Inspectorate has also taken into account that Aleris has used some integrity enhancement measures, performed certain restrictions regarding occupational categories' reading qualifications and documented access to one correct way. In determining the seriousness of the infringements, it can also be stated that the infringements also cover the basic principles set out in Article 5 (i) the Data Protection Regulation, which belongs to the categories of more serious infringements which may give rise to a higher penalty under Article 83 (5) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. Taken together, these factors mean that the infringements, not to implement a needs and risk analysis and not to limit users' permissions to only what is needed for the user to be able to fulfill theirs tasks in health care, is not to be judged as minor infringements without infringements that should lead to an administrative penalty fee. The Data Inspectorate considers that these violations are closely related to each other. That assessment is based on the need and risk analysis form the basis for the allocation of the authorizations. The Data Inspectorate therefore considers that these infringements are so closely linked that they constitute interconnected data processing within the meaning of Article 83 (3) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate therefore decides on a joint penalty fee for these infringements. According to Article 83 (3), the administrative penalty fee may not exceed the amount of the most serious infringement in the case of one or the same data processing or interconnected data processing. The administrative penalty fee shall be effective, proportionate and deterrent. This means that the amount must be determined so that it Page 27 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 2 8 (30) the administrative penalty fee leads to correction, that it provides a preventive effect and that it is also proportional in relation to both current violations as to the ability of the supervised entity to pay. As regards the calculation of the amount, Article 83 (5) (i) the Data Protection Regulation that companies that commit infringements are the ones in question may be subject to penalty fees of up to EUR 20 million or four percent of total global annual sales in the previous financial year, depending on which value is highest. The term company includes all companies that conduct a financial activity, regardless of the legal status of the entity or the manner in which it operates financed. A company can therefore consist of an individual company in the sentence one legal person, but also by several natural persons or companies. Thus there are situations where an entire group is treated as a company and its total annual turnover shall be used to calculate the amount of a infringement of the Data Protection Regulation by one of its companies. Recital 150 in the Data Protection Ordinance states, among other things following. \[…\] If the administrative penalty fees are imposed on a company, a company for that purpose should be considered a company within the meaning of Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU \[…\]. This means that the assessment of what constitutes a company must be based on the definitions of competition law. The rules for group liability in EU competition law revolve around the concept of economic unit. A parent company and a subsidiary are considered as part of the same economic entity when the parent company exercises one decisive influence over the subsidiary. The Data Inspectorate therefore adds as a starting point, the turnover for Aleris Group AB as a basis for the calculation of the size of the penalty fee. Aleris Group AB was formed at the end of 2019. Some turnover figures for the whole 2019 is thus not available. There is therefore no information on the annual turnover for determining the amount of the penalty fee. Aleris has stated that the group turnover for Aleris Group AB amounted to just over 1.2 billion between 1 October 2019 and 31 December 2019. Recalculated for an entire year, this would correspond to a turnover of approximately 4.9 billion. Page 28 of 30Datainspektionen DI-2019-3844 2 9 (30) The Data Inspectorate states that the actual annual sales for Aleris Group AB this year will be significantly higher. In the current case, the Data Inspectorate applies a precautionary principle and therefore appreciates that the company's annual turnover at least corresponds to that of the period October - December 2019 recalculated for full year, ie approximately 4.9 billion. The maximum sanction amount that can be determined in the current case is EUR 20,000,000, which is just over four percent of the company's estimated revenue. Given the seriousness of the infringements and that the administrative the penalty fee must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive the Data Inspectorate determines the administrative sanction fee for Aleris Sjukvård AB to SEK 15,000,000 (fifteen million). This decision was made by Director General Lena Lindgren Schelin after presentation by the IT security specialist Magnus Bergström. At the final The case is also handled by the General Counsel Hans-Olof Lindblom, the unit managers Katarina Tullstedt and Malin Blixt and the lawyer Linda Hamidi participated.

KRY has not carried out needs and risk analyzes that meet the requirements according to the provisions in ch. 4 § 2 and ch. 6 § 7 the Patient Data Act (2008: 355) and ch. 4 Section 2 of the National Board of Health and Welfare regulations and general advice on record keeping and processing of personal data in health care (HSLF-FS 2016: 40) before allocation of permissions takes place in the journal system ProReNata and National patient overview. This means that KRY is not in sufficient to the extent that it has taken appropriate organizational measures to: be able to ensure and be able to show that the treatment of the personal data has a security that is appropriate in relation to the risks. 2. KRY has not shown that KRY has restricted users' permissions for access to the ProReNata medical record system and the National Patient Overview limited to what is only needed for the user to be able to perform their duties in health care accordingly 1 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on protection for natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free flow of such information and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Ordinance) .Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 4 (31) with ch. 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 § 2 HSLF- FS 2016: 40. This means that KRY has not taken sufficient measures to ensure and demonstrate appropriate security for personal data. The Data Inspectorate states that KRY since the inspection on April 4, 2019 has improved its needs and risk analyzes but that the analyzes are not in all parts meet the requirements that apply according to ch. § 2 and ch. 6 § 7 the Patient Data Act (2008: 355) and ch. 4 Section 2 of the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations and general advice on record keeping and processing of personal data in health and healthcare (HSLF-FS 2016: 40). The Data Inspectorate submits pursuant to Article 58 (2) (d) i the data protection ordinance KRY to supplement by the last February 2021 the needs and risk analyzes for the journal systems ProReNata and National patient overview by developing the analysis of the risks for those registered rights and freedoms and that thereafter, with the support of needs and the risk analyzes, make a reassessment regarding the allocation of permissions so that each user has access to only those personal data needed for the user to be able to fulfill his health care tasks, in accordance with Article 32 (1) and 32.2 of the Data Protection Ordinance, Chapter 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. Report on the supervisory matter The Data Inspectorate initiated supervision by letter dated 22 March 2019 and has on site on April 4, 2019 reviewed KRY's decision to award authorizations have been preceded by a needs and risk analysis. Supervision has also included how KRY assigned permissions for access to the main medical record system ProReNata and the National Patient Overview and which access opportunities the granted privileges provide within both the framework of the internal secrecy according to ch. the Patient Data Act, as the cohesive one record keeping according to ch. 6 patient data law. In addition to this has The Data Inspectorate also examined the documentation of access (logs) contained in the journal system. The Data Inspectorate has only examined users' access to journal systems, i.e. what care documentation can the user actually takeData Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 5 (31) part of and read. Supervision does not include the functions included in the competence, ie. what the user can actually do in the journal system (eg issuing prescriptions, writing referrals, etc.). What has emerged in the case KRY has mainly stated the following. Personal data manager KRY is the care provider and personal data manager. Operation KRY conducts care via video meetings, so-called video care, which is done by the patient downloads the app KRY. KRY is the technical platform and also the brand that KRY uses externally towards patients. The app is available for mobile devices with the operating systems iOS or Android. It is KRY's parent company Webbhälsa AB (hereinafter Webbhälsa) that has developed the app and which handles the operation of the technical platform. Webbhälsa owns the brand KRY, develops the technology and services the care provider KRY with licenses. There are two separate legal units but the staff is sitting together in the same office. There are historical reasons behind the fact that there are two companies but one Operation. When KRY was created, Web Health turned to regions and county council to offer the service, but it took a long time to get caregivers to start using the service. That is why Webbhälsa started the company KRY as one own care provider that conducts care via the app KRY. Journal system KRY has stated that the record system used by KRY is called ProReNata and has been used since the business started in March 2016. For cohesive record keeping, the National Patient Overview (NPÖ) system is used. Users and patients At the time of the inspection, there were 490 people with access to ProReNata. On April 8, 2019, the total number of patients was registered in ProReNata 450 331.Datainspektionen DI-2019-3845 6 (31) Internal secrecy Needs and risk analysis During the inspection and subsequent inspection have essentially the following arrived. During the inspection on April 4, 2019, the Data Inspectorate took in a needs and risk analysis dated 11 March 2019. On 10 May 2019, KRY submitted a revised needs and risk analysis dated 2 May 2019 where also cohesive record keeping is included but which otherwise essentially contains the same and risk analysis as the document dated March 11, 2019. March 20, 2020 KRY came in with a new revised version dated March 1, 2020 that contains a largely revised analysis. The needs and risk analysis dated 11 March 2019 includes one description of needs in the business, risks and risk management. The document states, among other things, the following regarding needs in the business for healthcare professionals: Due to the business' medical focus, digital nature and absence of physical presence in different geographical areas, health and medical staff at KRY are organized in a single staff pool scheduled by administrative staff for meetings with all types of patients. Healthcare professionals are thus not organized solely based on necessary competence in the individual case (eg general practitioner, nurse or psychologist), scheduling and availability. Although some type of treatment, e.g. treatment of children under 6 months of age or treatment of certain symptoms typical of e.g. women, should be cared for by certain specialized personnel, the work of this personnel is not limited to these symptoms then they also meet other types of patients. In the event that KRY care operations change over time, by e.g. a larger number of available staff, several different categories of healthcare staff or care processes (such as specialist care), an updated needs and risk analysis will carried out to ensure patient safety but also to ensure respect for the patient integrity is constantly observed. To ensure good quality, availability and cost efficiency, it is of utmost importance that staff who participate in the actual care within the framework of KRY outpatient care and in a patient relationship, has a good and sufficient knowledge of the patient's medical history. All clinics and relevant administrative staff (such as medical secretaries who have relevant training for their assignment) hired by KRY may meet all patients who apply care via KRY and may then participate in the care of these and thus need access to the patient's medical record in order to be able to fulfill their duties. Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 7 (31) In summary, it is KRY's assessment that it is both business-like and unique distinctiveness there is a great need not to limit eligibility for medical and relevant administrative staff to certain geographically or demographically delimited patient groups in the current situation. For other types of authorizations, there is a more limited need in accordance with what as stated above. Under the heading ""risks"" it is stated that KRY sees a number of risks with a broad authorization and states that the risks in KRY's view are primarily:  Unauthorized access for healthcare professionals or relevant administrative staff due to ignorance of rules and procedures on confidentiality and patient safety;  Unauthorized access for healthcare professionals or relevant administrative staff as a result of mistakes or otherwise due to human factor;  Unauthorized access for healthcare professionals or relevant administrative staff as a result of deliberate abuse;  Unauthorized access by third parties due to health and healthcare professionals or relevant administrative staff lose equipment or, knowingly or unknowingly, sharing login information to systems; and  Unauthorized access by third parties due to data breaches. Under the heading ""risk management"" it is stated that KRY's assessment is that they risks arising from a broad allocation of privileges can be significantly limited and to an acceptable level through the organizational and technical safety measures taken by KRY, which mainly include:  Recruitment routines, including background checks, to minimize the risk of inappropriate individuals being given access to personal data about patients;  Routines for onboarding, which i.a. includes guidance and training on the use of systems, equipment, relevant statutes and routines regarding confidentiality and patient safety to raise awareness of obligations, rights and responsibilities;  Signing of a reminder of confidentiality and / or confidentiality commitments for to preventively reduce the risk of unauthorized access and to increase knowledge of confidentiality and patient safety;  Use of equipment provided and controlled by KRY; Datainspektionen DI-2019-3845 8 (31)  Routines for allocating, changing and removing permissions for to preventively minimize the risk that authorizations are not adequate over time;  Technical tools to preventively minimize the need for beatings in the record system and thus the risk of illegal access, e.g. like one results of mistakes or insufficient knowledge. In health and healthcare professionals' work for digital care, will only be relevant patient be available. In this system, no patient other than it can which the meeting concerns to be opened. To be able to search for other patients current personnel must actively make an unauthorized strike;  Obtaining patient approval before medical secretaries make beatings in patient records; and  Clear information to relevant personnel and routine for logging and control in order to prevent employees from refraining from doing so access and to reactively detect and follow up around such access. All journal openings that are not connected to one active care relationship / performed patient meeting is logged and reviewed manually. Under the heading ""conclusions"" it is stated, among other things: A broad competence for medical and administrative staff for patients journals are therefore justified under current conditions in KRY to be able to provide patient-safe care, provided that KRY operates one continued effective security work to identify, evaluate and manage risks in their business. However, this conclusion needs to be reconsidered regularly and may come to changes as KRY grows, changes medical orientation, develops their business concept and in other similar circumstances. One condition for being able to limit eligibility for different clinics, is that we despite this can ensure accessibility for patients. A division between clinics for which group of patients one has, presupposes a significant greater staff than the one currently available for KRY, but is one desirable goal to aim for in the long run. In the second revision dated March 1, 2020, KRY has largely reworked analysis and identified risks based on certain types of data and patient groups in the form of information on persons with a protected identity, Datainspektionen DI-2019-3845 9 (31) public figures, employees and staff's own tasks. Furthermore, KRY in the revised analysis also assessed probability and consequence for the identified risks. The analysis also contains more detailed information review of access needs for the various staff categories. To Unlike the previous versions of the analysis, KRY has come to the conclusion that a narrow qualification is sufficient for doctors, nurses and psychologists, except so-called plus doctors, plus psychologists and doctors on call. The tight the authorization is stated to mean that users can only access information about patients (both internal medical records and NPÖ) at patient meetings. Further stated that access is granted in connection with the staff is scheduled with patient and is automatically withdrawn 4 months after access was granted and that before meeting with patient has taken place can not beat on such patient happen. Authorization for access to personal data During the inspection, the following mainly emerged. Clinical staff, at the time of inspection, doctors, nurses and psychologists and administrative staff in the form of medical secretaries, have actual access to all data in all patient records in ProReNata. The there are limitations in the form of organizational and technical controls, which according to KRY has been an important part of the assessment of authorization management there KRY thought about what other security can be offered. KRY systematically reviews all journal accesses. All access is reviewed and matched against whether clinics had a meeting with the patient that day. In another In this case, access is flagged and reviewed to see if there is another reasonable one explanation of access. There is a check every four weeks for active accounts (by reviewing the personnel schedule). If, for example, one doctor does not have a passport booked for the next four weeks so is disabled doctor's account. If a doctor with an inactive account has a passport they have entered the account is activated for the next four weeks. The design of the permissions is based on the digital nature of the service that KRY offers, that care has a general focus and is not specialized, that patients are spread across the country, that the queue time for the patient should be as short as possible and that the staff is organized in one only staff pool. A patient who calls in gets help from a doctor one day and a completely different doctor the next day, and the doctors can sit in completely different places in the Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 1 0 (31) Sweden. According to KRY, this requires that doctors must be able to see each other journal information to be able to provide good care. KRY has made the assessment that all information available about the patients is relevant to healthcare professionals, but KRY is aware that this may come to change as the organization grows. In the needs and risk analysis dated 1 March 2020, KRY has done one more detailed analysis of the need for access to data in ProReNata based on those tasks of different categories of staff and concluded that a narrow eligibility is sufficient for doctors, nurses and psychologists in that way as described in the section above in the account of the revised needs and the risk analysis. Coherent record keeping During the inspection and subsequent inspection have essentially the following arrived. Needs and risk analysis During the inspection, there was no special needs and risk analysis for access to NPÖ. KRY has submitted two revised needs and risk analyzes dated 2 May 2019 and 1 March 2020 covering the use of national patient overview (NPÖ) in the operation. The needs and risk analysis dated 2 May 2019 otherwise contains essentially the same needs and risk analysis as the document dated March 11, 2019. In the needs and risk analysis dated 1 March 2020, KRY has done one more detailed analysis of the need for access to data in NPÖ based on the various the tasks of the staff categories. Authorization of access to personal data about patients KRY has stated that the care provider is part of a system for cohesion record keeping through NPÖ as a “consumer”. This means that the staff at KRY can take part in the information in NPÖ, but KRY ""produces"" (makes available) no own information in NPÖ. At the time of the inspection, it emerged that all staff had access to ProReNata also had access to NPÖ.Datainspektionen DI-2019-3845 1 1 (31) The revised needs and risk analysis dated 1 March 2020 shows that all personnel who have access to ProReNata as a starting point do not have one need for access to data in NPÖ. Nurses and care administrators are stated as a starting point to have a need for access to ProReNata but not to NPÖ. Documentation of access (logs) KRY has stated the following. For each strike in ProReNata, a log message is created with information about which staff at a given time made a strike. Time refers to both date and time. It is clear which patient it is, the identity of the user, what action the user has taken, for example signing, taking notes and reading. Because KRY is not organized in several different care units appear only one unit that is the same for all staff. There are three different types of logs in ProReNata; visitor logs, server logs and event logs. Visitor log shows when a user visited a journal and when it left the journal. Server log shows when the system registered one server calls to a journal and can mean that users have read but also other reasons. Event log shows logged system events that affect one user or patient, for example read, written or signed. Access to NPÖ is logged by Inera and is available to administrators at KRY. After the inspection, KRY has noted that the specific measure note cancellation (not signed) is not logged separately in ProReNata. KRY has raised this with ProReNata AB, which at KRY's request has developed such logging. Shreds of notes will also come therefore to be logged from 16 May 2019 in order to give KRY even better opportunities to follow up and ensure good and safe care.Datainspektionen DI-2019-3845 1 2 (31) Grounds for the decision Applicable rules The Data Protection Regulation is the primary source of law The Data Protection Regulation, often abbreviated GDPR, was introduced on 25 May 2018 and is the primary legal regulation in the processing of personal data. This also applies to health care. The basic principles for the processing of personal data are set out in Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation. A basic principle is the requirement security pursuant to Article 5 (1) (f), which states that personal data shall be processed in a way that ensures adequate security for personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unauthorized treatment and against loss, destruction or damage by accident, using appropriate technical or organizational measures. Article 5 (2) states the so-called liability, ie. that it personal data controllers must be responsible for and be able to show that the basic the principles set out in paragraph 1 are complied with. Article 24 deals with the responsibility of the controller. Of Article 24 (1) it appears that the person responsible for personal data is responsible for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate that the processing is performed in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. The measures shall carried out taking into account the nature, scope, context of the treatment and purposes and the risks, of varying degrees of probability and severity, for freedoms and rights of natural persons. The measures must be reviewed and updated if necessary. Article 32 regulates the security associated with the processing. According to paragraph 1 the personal data controller and the personal data assistant shall take into account of the latest developments, implementation costs and treatment nature, scope, context and purpose as well as the risks, of varying probability and seriousness, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of safety appropriate to the risk (…). According to paragraph 2, when assessing the appropriate level of safety, special consideration is given to the risks which the processing entails, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, Datainspektionen DI-2019-3845 1 3 (31) loss or alteration or to unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data transferred, stored or otherwise processed. Recital 75 states that in assessing the risk to natural persons rights and freedoms, various factors must be taken into account. Among other things mentioned personal data covered by professional secrecy, health data or sexual life, if the processing of personal data concerning vulnerable physical persons takes place persons, especially children, or if the treatment involves a large number personal data and applies to a large number of registered persons. Furthermore, it follows from recital 76 that the probable and serious risk of it data subjects' rights and freedoms should be determined on the basis of processing nature, scope, context and purpose. The risk should be evaluated on on the basis of an objective assessment, which determines whether the data processing involves a risk or a high risk. Recitals 39 and 83 also contain writings that provide guidance on it the meaning of the data protection regulation's requirements for security in Processing of personal data. The Data Protection Regulation and the relationship with complementary national provisions According to Article 5 (1) (a) of the Data Protection Regulation, personal data must: treated in a lawful manner. In order for the treatment to be considered legal, it is required legal basis by fulfilling at least one of the conditions of Article 6 (1). The provision of health care is one such task of general interest referred to in Article 6 (1) (e). In health care, the legal bases can also be legal obligation in Article 6 (1) (c) and the exercise of authority under Article 6 (1) (e) updated. When it comes to the legal bases legal obligation, in general interest or exercise of authority by the Member States, in accordance with Article 6.2, maintain or introduce more specific provisions for adaptation the application of the provisions of the Regulation to national circumstances. National law may specify specific requirements for the processing of data and other measures to ensure legal and equitable treatment. But there is not only an opportunity to introduce national rules but also a Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 1 4 (31) duty; Article 6 (3) states that the basis for the treatment referred to in paragraph 1 (c) and (e) shall be determined in accordance with Union law or national law of the Member States. The legal basis may also include specific provisions to adapt the application of the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation. Union law or the national law of the Member States law must fulfill an objective of general interest and be proportionate to it legitimate goals pursued. Article 9 states that the treatment of specific categories of personal data (so-called sensitive personal data) is prohibited. Sensitive personal data includes data on health. Article 9 (2) states except when sensitive personal data may still be processed. Article 9 (2) (h) states that the processing of sensitive personal data may be repeated the treatment is necessary for reasons related to, among other things the provision of health care on the basis of Union law or national law of the Member States or in accordance with agreements with professionals in the field of health and provided that the conditions and protective measures provided for in referred to in paragraph 3 are met. Article 9 (3) imposes a regulated duty of confidentiality. This means that both the legal bases of general interest, exercise of authority and legal obligation in the treatment of the vulnerable personal data under the exemption in Article 9 (2) (h) supplementary rules. Supplementary national regulations In the case of Sweden, both the basis for the treatment and those special conditions for the processing of personal data in the field of health and healthcare regulated in the Patient Data Act (2008: 355), and the Patient Data Ordinance (2008: 360). I 1 kap. Section 4 of the Patient Data Act states that the law complements the data protection regulation. The purpose of the Patient Data Act is to provide information in health and healthcare must be organized so as to meet patient safety and good quality and promotes cost efficiency. Its purpose is also to personal data shall be designed and otherwise processed so that patients and the privacy of other data subjects is respected. In addition, must be documented personal data is handled and stored so that unauthorized persons do not have access to it them (Chapter 1, Section 2 of the Patient Data Act). The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 1 5 (31) The supplementary provisions in the Patient Data Act aim to: take care of both privacy protection and patient safety. The legislator has thus through the regulation made a balance as to how the information must be processed to meet both the requirements for patient safety as the right to privacy in the processing of personal data. The National Board of Health and Welfare has, with the support of the Patient Data Ordinance, issued regulations and general advice on record keeping and processing of personal data in health care (HSLF-FS 2016: 40). The regulations constitute such supplementary rules, which shall be applied in the care provider's treatment of personal data in health care. National provisions supplementing the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation safety can be found in Chapters 4 and 6. the Patient Data Act and Chapters 3 and 4 HSLF-FS 2016: 40. Requirement to do needs and risk analysis According to ch. 4, the care provider must § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40 make a needs and risk analysis, before the allocation of authorizations in the system takes place. That the analysis requires both the needs and the risks is clear from the preparatory work to the Patient Data Act, prop. 2007/08: 126 pp. 148-149, as follows. Authorization for staff's electronic access to patient information shall be restricted to what the executive needs to be able to perform his duties in health and healthcare. This includes that authorizations must be followed up and changed or restricted accordingly hand as changes in the tasks of the individual executive give rise to it. The provision corresponds in principle to section 8 of the Health Care Register Act. The purpose of the provision is to imprint the obligation of the responsible caregiver to make active and individual eligibility assignments based on analyzes of which details are different staff categories and different types of activities need. But it's not just needed needs analyzes. Risk analyzes must also be done where different types of risks are taken into account, such as may be associated with an overly availability of certain types of information. Protected personal data that is classified, information about publicly known persons, data from certain clinics or medical specialties are examples of categories such as may require special risk assessments. In general, it can be said that the more comprehensive an information system is, the greater the amount there must be different levels of authorization. Decisive for decisions on eligibility for e.g. various categories of healthcare professionals for electronic access to data in patient records should be that the authorization should be limited to what the executive needsData Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 1 6 (31) for the purpose a good and safe patient care. A more extensive or coarse-meshed competence allocation should - even if it has points from the point of view of efficiency - is considered an unjustified dissemination of journal information within a business and should as such not accepted. Furthermore, data should be stored in different layers so that more sensitive data require active choices or otherwise not as easily accessible to staff as less sensitive tasks. When it applies to personnel who work with business follow-up, statistics production, central financial administration and similar activities that are not individual-oriented, it should be most executives have enough access to information that can only be indirectly derived to individual patients. Electronic access to code keys, social security numbers and others data that directly point out individual patients should be able to be strong in this area limited to individuals. Internal secrecy The provisions in ch. 4 The Patient Data Act concerns internal confidentiality, ie. regulates how privacy protection is to be handled within a care provider's business and especially employees' opportunities to prepare for personal data that is electronically available in a healthcare provider organisation. It appears from ch. Section 2 of the Patient Data Act stipulates that the care provider must decide conditions for granting access to such data patients who are fully or partially automated. Such authorization shall limited to what is needed for the individual to be able to fulfill theirs tasks in health care. According to ch. 4 § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40, the care provider shall be responsible for each users are assigned an individual privilege to access personal data. The caregiver's decision on the allocation of eligibility shall preceded by a needs and risk analysis. Coherent record keeping The provisions in ch. 6 the Patient Data Act concerns cohesive record keeping, which means that a care provider - under the conditions specified in § 2 of the same chapter - may have direct access to personal data processed by others caregivers for purposes related to care documentation. The access to information is provided by a healthcare provider making the information about a patient which the care provider registers if the patient is available to other care providers who participate in the coherent record keeping (see Bill 2007/08: 126 p. 247). The Swedish Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 1 7 (31) Of ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act follows that the provisions in Chapter 4 § 2 also applies to authorization allocation for coherent record keeping. The requirement of that the care provider must perform a needs and risk analysis before allocating permissions in the system take place, also applies in systems for cohesion record keeping. Documentation of access (logs) Of ch. 4 Section 3 of the Patient Data Act states that a care provider must ensure that access to such data on patients who are kept in whole or in part automatically documented and systematically checked. According to ch. 4 Section 9 HSLF-FS 2016: 40, the care provider shall be responsible for that 1. it appears from the documentation of the access (logs) which measures taken with information on a patient, 2. it appears from the logs at which care unit or care process measures have been taken, 3. the logs indicate the time at which the measures were taken; 4. the identity of the user and the patient is stated in the logs. The Data Inspectorate's assessment Personal data controller's responsibility for security As previously described, Article 24 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation provides a general requirement for the personal data controller to take appropriate technical and organizational measures. The requirement is partly to ensure that the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with the Data Protection Ordinance, and that the data controller must be able to demonstrate that the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. The safety associated with the treatment is regulated more specifically in the articles 5.1 f and 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. Article 32 (1) states that the appropriate measures shall be both technical and organizational and they must ensure a level of security that is appropriate in in relation to the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons which the treatment entails. It is therefore necessary to identify the possible ones the risks to the data subjects' rights and freedoms and assess the probability that the risks will occur and the severity if they do occur.Datainspektionen DI-2019-3845 1 8 (31) What is appropriate varies not only in relation to the risks but also based on the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment. It has thus the significance of what personal data is processed, how many data, it is a question of how many people process the data, etc. The health service has a great need for information in its operations. The It is therefore natural that the possibilities of digitalisation are utilized as much as possible in healthcare. Since the Patient Data Act was written, one has a lot extensive digitization has taken place in healthcare. Both the data collections size as the number of people sharing information with each other has increased substantially. At the same time, this increase means that the demands on it increase personal data controller, as the assessment of what is an appropriate safety is affected by the extent of the treatment. It is also a question of sensitive personal data and the data concerns people who are in a situation of dependence when they are in need of care. It is also often a question of a lot of personal information about each and every one the data may over time be processed by very many people. All in all, this places great demands on the person responsible for personal data. The data processed must be protected from outside actors as well the business as against unauthorized access from within the business. It can It should be noted that Article 32 (2) states that the controller, at assessment of the appropriate level of safety, in particular taking into account the risks of unintentional or unlawful destruction, loss or unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access. To be able to know what is an unauthorized access must the data controller must be clear about what an authorized access is. Needs and risk analysis The National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations that supplement the Patient Data Act contain it stated in ch. 4 § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40, that the care provider shall make a needs and risk analysis before the allocation of authorizations in the system takes place. This means that national law prescribes requirements for an appropriate organizational measure that shall: taken before the allocation of authorizations to journal systems takes place. A needs and risk analysis must include an analysis of the needs and a analysis of the risks from an integrity perspective that may be associated with an excessive allocation of access to personal data about patients. Both the needs and the risks must be assessed on the basis of the Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 1 9 (31) tasks that need to be processed in the business, what processes it is the question of whether and what risks to the privacy of the individual exist. The assessments of the risks need to be made on the basis of organizational level, there for example, a certain business part or task may be more privacy sensitive than another, but also based on the individual level, if it is the issue of, for example, protected personal data, generally known persons or otherwise particularly vulnerable persons. Also the size of the system affects the risk assessment. The preparatory work for the Patient Data Act states that the more comprehensive an information system is, the greater the variety eligibility levels must exist (Bill 2007/08: 126 p. 149). It is thus a question of a strategic analysis at a strategic level, which should yield an authorization structure that is adapted to the business and this should kept up to date. In summary, the regulation requires that the risk analysis identifies  different categories of tasks, Categories of data subjects (eg vulnerable natural persons and children), or  the scope (eg number of personal data and registered)  negative consequences for data subjects (eg injuries, significant social or economic disadvantage, deprivation of rights and freedoms), and how they affect the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons Processing of personal data. This applies both within internal secrecy as in coherent record keeping. The risk analysis must also include special risk assessments, for example based on whether there is protected personal data that is classified, information on public figures, information from certain clinics or medical specialties (Bill 2007/08: 126 p. 148- 149). The risk analysis must also include an assessment of how probable and serious the risk to the data subjects' rights and freedoms is based on the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment (recital 76). Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 2 0 (31) It is thus through the needs and risk analysis that it personal data controller finds out who needs access, which data access shall include, at what times and at what context access is needed, while analyzing the risks to it the freedoms and rights of the individual that the treatment may lead to. The result should then lead to the technical and organizational measures needed to ensure that there is no access other than that which is needed and the risk analysis shows that it should be justified. When a needs and risk analysis is missing prior to the allocation of qualifications in system, lacks the basis for the personal data controller on a legal be able to assign their users a correct authorization. The the data controller is responsible for, and shall have control over, the personal data processing that takes place within the framework of the business. To assign users a when accessing journal system, without this being founded on a performed needs and risk analysis, means that the person responsible for personal data does not have sufficient control over the personal data processing that takes place in the journal system and also can not show that he has the control that required. When the Data Inspectorate during the inspection requested a documented needs and risk analysis, KRY submitted a document dated 11 March 2019 with the heading ""Authorization allocation Needs and risk analysis"". KRY has thereafter, on 10 May 2019, KRY submitted a revised needs and risk analysis dated 2 May 2019, which also includes coherent record keeping but which otherwise essentially contain the same needs and risk analysis as the document dated 11 March 2019. On 20 March 2020, KRY submitted a new one revised version dated March 1, 2020 which contains a largely revised analysis. In the needs and risk analysis from 11 March 2019, KRY has carried out an analysis regarding internal confidentiality where the need for access to personal data in the journal system has been weighed against risks that KRY considers to follow access rights. It appears that the purpose is to land based on the analysis in a model for authorization allocation in the business. In the analysis, KRY identified and described the need for access based on how KRY conducts its Operation. Furthermore, KRY has identified and described needs based on different duties of staff categories. KRY has come to a conclusion after the Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 2 1 (31) have weighed the need against the risks identified by KRY and the measures taken to reduce the risks. The Data Inspectorate can state that KRY has carried out a needs and risk analysis that identifies and analyzes needs and risks. The analysis is implemented at strategic level and shall form a basis for the business authorization. The needs and partly also the risks are analyzed based on the actual conditions in the business. KRY has based on it analysis that has been carried out identified technical and organizational measures to reduce the risk of unauthorized access. In its initial analysis, however, KRY has not taken into account how negative consequences for data subjects, different categories of data, categories of registered, or the extent of the number of personal data and registered, affects the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons at KRY processing of personal data in ProReNata and National Patient Overview. There are also no special risk assessments based on whether there are e.g. protected personal data that are classified, general information celebrities, information from certain clinics or medical specialties or other factors that require special protection measures. The there is also no assessment of how likely and serious the risk is for them data subjects' rights and freedoms are deemed to be. KRY has thus taken measures that are likely to reduce the risk of physical rights and freedoms of persons. However, the needs are too general analyzed and the risks to the data subjects' rights and freedoms are not in adequately identified and assessed. Among other things, a deeper one is missing analysis of the risks to the individual's integrity based on both different categories of data as different categories of data subjects. In summary, the Data Inspectorate states that KRY at carried out a needs and risk analysis at strategic level, but that it does not meet the requirements of the data protection regulations such analysis because KRY has not considered the risks, of varying probability and seriousness, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons and not taken into account the different types of risks to the privacy of the individual that may be associated with an overly accessible availability regarding certain types of data. The Data Inspectorate states that KRY thereby at the time of the inspection has not carried out a needs and risk analysis that meets the requirements that the Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 2 2 (31) set in Chapter 4 § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40, neither within the framework of internal secrecy or within the framework of the unified record keeping, according to 4 respectively Chapter 6 patient data law. This means that KRY has not taken appropriate organizational measures in accordance with Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 31 (1) and (2) for be able to ensure and, in accordance with Article 5 (2), be able to demonstrate that: the processing of personal data has a security that is appropriate in in relation to the risks. KRY has supplemented with a needs and risk analysis dated 1 March 2020. In the new needs and risk analysis, KRY has largely reworked analysis and identified risks based on certain types of data and patient groups in the form of information on persons with a protected identity, public figures, employees and staff's own tasks. Furthermore, KRY in the revised analysis also assessed probability and consequence for the identified risks. The analysis also contains more detailed information review of access needs for the various staff categories. Unlike the previous versions of the analysis, KRY has emerged that a narrow qualification is sufficient for doctors, nurses and psychologists, except so-called plus doctors, plus psychologists and doctors on call. The tight the authorization is stated to mean that users can only access information about patients (both internal medical records and NPÖ) at patient meetings. Further stated that access is granted in connection with the staff is scheduled with patient and is automatically withdrawn 4 months after access was granted and that before meeting with patient has taken place can not beat on such patient happen. The Data Inspectorate can state that the new needs and risk analysis contains an in-depth needs analysis where both organization, different occupational categories and different tasks have been taken into account. Concerning the risk assessment, it is also in-depth and at least takes into account different categories of registered. It also includes an assessment of how likely or the serious risk to the data subjects' rights and freedoms is. KRY has based on the new roles created more limited access opportunities. Based on its special activities, KRY does not have such a complex organization that further needs assessments are required. As for the risks so they are still not analyzed on the basis of categories of data. TasksData Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 2 3 (31) which can be perceived as more privacy-sensitive are, for example, information such as concerns sexual life, substance abuse, mental illness or threats or violence especially if it is in close relations. Even the analysis based on categories of registered can deepened by the categories that are actually dealt with in the business undergone. The fact that the business has a homogeneous structure means that it will be even more important to analyze these risks and assess if and how they can be remedied because such a large proportion of staff need to be assigned the same type of access. Authorization for access to personal data about patients As reported above, a caregiver may have a legitimate interest in having a comprehensive processing of data on the health of individuals. Notwithstanding this shall access to personal data about patients may be limited to what is needed for the individual to be able to fulfill his or her duties. With regard to the allocation of authorization for electronic access according to ch. § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act states that in the preparatory work, Bill. 2007/08: 126 pp. 148-149, i.a. that there should be different eligibility categories in the journal system and that the permissions should be limited to what the user need to provide the patient with good and safe care. It also appears that “a more extensive or coarse-grained eligibility should be considered as one unauthorized dissemination of journal information within a business and should as such is not accepted. "" In health care, it is the person who needs the information in their work who may be authorized to access them. This applies both within a caregivers as between caregivers. It is, as already mentioned, through the needs and risk analysis that the person responsible for personal data finds out who who need access, what information the access should include, at which times and in which contexts access is needed, and at the same time analyzes the risks to the individual's freedoms and rights the treatment can lead to. The result should then lead to the technical and organizational measures needed to ensure no allocation of eligibility provides further access opportunities than the one that needs and the risk analysis shows is justified. An important organizational measure is to provide instruction to those who have the authority to assign authorizations on how this should go to and what should be considered so that it, with the needs and risk analysis as a basis, becomes a correct authorization allocation in each individual case.Datainspektionen DI-2019-3845 2 4 (31) It appears that KRY at the time of the inspection had not limited health care professionals and medical secretaries access to data on patients either within its framework internal confidentiality of the ProReNata medical record system, or within the framework of coherent record keeping in the journal system NPÖ. KRY, on the other hand, had introduced measures to avoid unauthorized access, including in the form of logging and manual review of all journal openings that were not linked to an active care relationship or performed patient meeting and deactivation of accounts every four weeks for doctors without passports booked the next four the weeks. Because the needs and risk analysis that KRY had carried out the time of the inspection did not take sufficient account of the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons or the different types risks that may be associated with an overly accessible regarding certain types of information, KRY has not shown that the reading permissions have been restricted in the manner required by the Data Protection Ordinance and the Patient Data Act. This in turn has meant that there has been a risk of unauthorized access and unjustified dissemination of personal data partly within the framework of the internal secrecy, partly within the framework of the coherent record keeping. KRY has, through subsequent measures taken, reduced that risk by improving analyzes and subsequent measures taken. In the light of the above, the Data Inspectorate can state that KRY at the time of the inspection has processed personal data in violation of Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) of the Data Protection Regulation by KRY, in accordance with with Article 5 (2) and (1), has not been able to show that KRY has restricted users' permissions for access to the journal system ProReNata and National patient overview to what is only needed for the user to be able to fulfill their duties in health care according to ch. § 2 and Chapter 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. The needs and risk analysis dated 1 March 2020 shows that KRY has introduced restrictions on access to personal data about patients. Unlike the previous versions of the analysis, KRY has come to the conclusion that a narrow eligibility is sufficient for doctors, nurses and psychologists, except so-called plus doctors, plus psychologists and doctors on call. The narrow authority is stated to mean that users can only access information about patientsData Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 2 5 (31) (both internal medical records and NPÖ) at patient meetings. It is further stated that access assigned in connection with the staff is scheduled with the patient and drawn automatically returned 4 months after access was granted and that before meeting with patient has taken place, beating on such patient can not take place. KRY has thus improved the restriction of access since the inspection. As stated in the section above regarding the new needs and However, the risk analysis still requires some additions to the analysis must be comprehensive and be able to show that access has been restricted accordingly with the requirements of the Data Protection Ordinance and the Patient Data Act. From the result of these additions must then KRY assess its model for authorization. Documentation of access (logs) The Data Inspectorate can state that from the logs in ProReNata and NPÖ information on which staff made one at a given time beating. Time refers to both date and time. It is clear which patient it concerns, the user's identity, what the user has taken for action, such as signing, taking notes, and reading. Because KRY is not organized in several different care units, only one unit appears that is the same for all staff. After the inspection, KRY has noted that the specific measure note cancellation (not signed) is not logged separately in ProReNata but that KRY has stated that such logging has been introduced as of the 16th May 2019. The Data Inspectorate notes that the documentation of the access (the logs) in ProReNata and NPÖ are now in accordance with the requirements which appears from ch. 4 9 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. Choice of intervention Legal regulation If there has been a violation of the Data Protection Regulation The Data Inspectorate a number of corrective powers available under the article 58.2 a-j of the Data Protection Regulation. The supervisory authority can, among other things instruct the data controller to ensure that the processing takes place in in accordance with the Regulation and if required in a specific way and within a specific period.Datainspektionen DI-2019-3845 2 6 (31) It follows from Article 58 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation that the Data Inspectorate in in accordance with Article 83 shall impose penalty charges in addition to or in lieu of other corrective measures referred to in Article 58 (2), the circumstances of each individual case. The overall starting point for imposition of a penalty fee is that in the individual case it is judged to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive (cf. Article 83 (1)). Article 83 (2) sets out the factors to be taken into account in determining whether a administrative penalty fee shall be imposed, but also what shall affect the size of the penalty fee. Of central importance for the assessment of the seriousness of the infringement is its nature, severity and duration. If in the case of a minor infringement, the supervisory authority may, according to reasons 148 of the Data Protection Regulation, issue a reprimand instead of imposing one penalty fee. Assessment of whether a penalty fee should be imposed The health service has a great need for information in its operations. The It is therefore natural that the possibilities of digitalisation are utilized as much as possible in healthcare. Since the Patient Data Act was written, one has a lot extensive digitization has taken place in healthcare. Both the data collections size as the number of people sharing information with each other has increased substantially. At the same time, this increase means that the demands on it increase personal data controller, as the assessment of what is an appropriate safety is affected by the extent of the treatment. In this context, it means an even greater responsibility for it personal data controller to protect the data from unauthorized access, among other things by having an authorization allocation that is even more comminuted. It is therefore essential that there is a real analysis of the needs based on different activities and different executives. Equally important is that there is an actual analysis of the risks from an integrity perspective may occur in the event of an override of access rights. From this analysis must then restrict the access of the individual executive. This authority must then be followed up and changed or restricted accordingly hand that changes in the tasks of the individual executive provide reason for it. The Data Inspectorate has found that KRY at the Data Inspectorate's inspection conducted a needs and risk analysis at a strategic level, but that the analysisData Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 2 7 (31) not fully taken into account the risks, of varying degrees of probability and severity, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons and that KRY has not taken different considerations into account kind of risks to the privacy of the individual that may be associated with one too in the case of availability regarding certain types of data. KRY then has in March 2020 performed a new needs and risk analysis. The new needs and the risk analysis goes deeper than the previous one and takes into account both organization and different occupational categories and tasks. The risk assessment is also that in-depth and now also includes an assessment of probability and seriousness of risks to data subjects' fundamental freedoms and rights. Although the needs analysis can now be considered acceptable, it is missing still parts relating to the risk assessment. What needs closer remedied, the Data Inspectorate describes below under the heading injunction. The Data Inspectorate's inspection has thus shown that KRY has not met the requirement to take appropriate security measures to protect the personal data in the journal systems by not having fully complied with the requirements that follow the Patient Data Act and the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations on implementing and risk analysis, before the allocation of authorizations in the system takes place. Thereby KRY has also not been able to show that KRY has limited the authorization for access to only what is needed for the individual to be able to fulfill their duties in health care. This means that KRY does not has also complied with the requirements of Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. The lack of compliance includes both the internal secrecy according to ch. the Patient Data Act as the cohesive one record keeping according to ch. 6 patient data law. The Data Inspectorate can state that the violations are the starting point serious in terms of provisions that are fundamental to ensuring that the processing of personal data is subject to adequate security measures to protect the data subjects' fundamental freedoms and rights. Also the nature of the data, the number of data subjects concerned, which in this case amounts to about 450,000 patients, as the number of employees and the availability of a large proportion of them employees to these patients' tasks speak in an aggravating direction. In determining the seriousness of the infringements, it can also be stated that the infringements also cover the basic principles set out in Article 5 (i) the Data Protection Ordinance, which belongs to the categories of more serious Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 2 8 (31) infringements which may give rise to a higher penalty under Article 83 (5) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. It is thus typically not a question of minor infringements but infringements which should normally lead to an administrative penalty charge. When assessing whether a penalty fee should be imposed, it must be considered at the same time if required, taking into account that it is a matter of a measure as in it individual case is effective, proportionate and dissuasive. As has been seen, at the time of the inspection, KRY had made a and risk analysis at strategic level and taken measures as likely reduces the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. KRY has thus tried to comply with the requirements for the processing of personal data and has to a not insignificant extent taken measures in order to comply with the requirements and reduce the risks. The Data Inspectorate assesses that KRY's lack of compliance has not meant that the data subjects have been deprived of protection of their rights and freedoms to the same extent as if none or only deficient measures had been taken. KRY has also taken steps to try to come to terms with it shortcomings in the needs and risk analysis after the Data Inspectorate's inspection by to establish and submit to the Data Inspectorate two revised needs and risk analyzes. It should also be taken into account that KRY itself has drawn attention lack of logging and taken measures to remedy that shortcoming. In a weighted assessment, the Data Inspectorate finds that they are relevant the infringements are admittedly typically of such a nature that a administrative penalty fee should normally be imposed but that in the case the case is not proportionate to such an intervention by The Data Inspectorate. KRY should instead be ordered to take measures to ensure that the processing takes place in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. Order When deciding on an injunction, the Data Inspectorate considers the revisions of the needs and risk analysis that KRY has done after the inspection. During the supervision case, KRY has revised its needs and risk analysis on two occasions. The first revision was made on 2 May 2019 and the Swedish Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 29 (31) the second revision was made on March 1, 2020. Through the first revision KRY adjusted the analysis to also include coherent record keeping in NPÖ. In the second revision, KRY has largely reworked the analysis and identified risks based on certain types of data and patient groups in form of data on persons with a protected identity, public figures, employees and the staff's own tasks. Furthermore, in the revised analysis, KRY has also assessed probability and impact on the identified risks. The analysis also contains more detailed review of access needs for the various staff categories. Unlike previous versions of the analysis KRY has come to the conclusion that a narrow qualification is sufficient for doctors, nurses and psychologists, except for so-called plus doctors and emergency services. The tight privileges are said to mean that users can only take part information about patients (both internal medical records and NPÖ) at patient meetings. It is further stated that access is granted in connection with the staff scheduled with patient and automatically withdrawn 4 months after access granted and that before meeting with patient has taken place can not beating on such patient happen. The Data Inspectorate states that KRY since the inspection on April 4, 2019 has improved its needs and risk analysis so that it increasingly meets the requirements for a needs and risk analysis. The Data Inspectorate notes, however, that the analysis does not describe the risks for those registered on other than that it is stated that there is a risk of disclosure of confidentiality and privacy damage or privacy threat. The analysis lacks a more detailed description of what such injury or threat consists of and the extent of the treatment affects the risk. The Data Inspectorate therefore submits KRY, pursuant to Article 58 (2) (d) i the Data Protection Regulation, to be completed by the last February 2021 at the latest the needs and risk analyzes for the journal systems ProReNata and National patient overview by developing the analysis of the risks for those registered rights and freedoms and that thereafter, with the support of needs and the risk analyzes, make a reassessment regarding the allocation of permissions so that each user has access to only those personal data needed for the user to be able to fulfill his tasks in health care, in accordance with Article 32 (1) and the Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 3 0 (31) 32.2 of the Data Protection Ordinance, Chapter 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Data Inspectorate DI-2019-3845 3 1 (31) This decision was made by Director General Lena Lindgren Schelin after presentation by the IT security specialist Magnus Bergström.

Administrative penalty fee The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of Articles 58 (2) and 83 the Data Protection Ordinance and Chapter 6 Section 2 of the Data Protection Act 2 att The Board of Education in the City of Stockholm for the violations of Article 5 (1) and Article 32 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation shall pay an administrative fee penalty fee of SEK 4,000,000 (four million). Injunctions The Data Inspectorate submits pursuant to Article 58 (2) (d) data protection ordinance education board to implement one as soon as possible impact assessment in accordance with Article 35 of the Data Protection Regulation regarding the subsystems Compulsory school surveillance, Student documentation and Home page for guardians. The Data Inspectorate submits pursuant to Article 58 (2) (d) data protection ordinance The Board of Education in the City of Stockholm to limit eligibility assignments in the module Compulsory schooling for only those persons who have a need to process personal data in order to perform their tasks. 2 The Act (2018: 218) with supplementary provisions to the EU Data Protection Regulation Page 4 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 4 (31) 1. Report on the supervisory matter The Data Inspectorate has through reports of personal data incidents from The Board of Education in the city of Stockholm has drawn attention to unauthorized persons access to student information in the School Platform. From the reports received, it has emerged that the digital platform used in the city of Stockholm, Skolplattformen, is a city-wide project and the platform consists of six subsystems. It has also emerged that The Board of Education in the City of Stockholm is responsible for personal data for them personal data processing in the School Platform to which the incidents relate. In the light of these reports, the Data Inspectorate has initiated the relevant case supervision on 24 June 2019 (dnr 2019-7024) by the Board of Education processing of personal data, for the purpose of reviewing the security measures for access to personal data within the framework of two modules of the subsystem Child and student register: • Compulsory school monitoring • Inter-municipal agreements After the supervision began, the education committee came in with more reports of personal data incidents. In the light of the information provided by appeared in these notifications, the Data Inspectorate decided on 18 June 2020 to extend supervision to include a review of security measures for access to personal data under the subsystems: • Student documentation • Home page for guardians (Home page) • The administration interface “Contact information teacher ”(Administration interface) With regard to Intermunicipal agreements, it has emerged that it constitutes a module in The children and student register. This module has not been fully implemented and used by a limited number of users. In the module Intermunicipal agreements there have been nine students. The incident in the module did not include children protected identity as stated in the notification of the personal data incident. Against this background, the Data Inspectorate has not examined the module in more detail Inter-municipal agreements. Page 5 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 5 (31) When it comes to compulsory schooling, it is a module 3 in Children and the student register, which constitutes administrative system support for the Board of Education must be able to fulfill its obligations under the Education Act (2010: 800). Of the received reports of the personal data incident, it has it has emerged that unauthorized personnel have had the opportunity to see information about classified persons. Against this background, the Data Inspectorate has reviewed the technical measures that the board has taken to ensure one appropriate security level in the module. The inspectorate has also examined organizational measures in the form of authorization allocation in the current module. The incoming personal data incidents regarding the subsystems Student documentation, the Home page and the Administration interface have touched technical deficiencies. The Data Inspectorate has therefore only examined the technical ones measures that have been taken to ensure an appropriate level of safety in these three subsystems. The Data Inspectorate's review also refers to the obligation to perform one impact assessment in accordance with Article 35 of the Data Protection Regulation concerning the current subsystems. The Board of Education is responsible for 139 compulsory schools, 32 compulsory special schools, 28 upper secondary schools and six upper secondary special schools. The Data Inspectorate's current review does not refer to adult education or preschool activities. 2. Justification of decision 2.1 Applicable provisions The data controller is as defined in Article 4 of the the Data Protection Regulation a natural or legal person, public authority, institution or other body alone or together with others determines the purposes and means of processing personal data; if the purposes and means of processing are determined by Union law or national law of the Member States, the controller or 3 The Board of Education has stated that compulsory schooling is both a module and its own process area. Page 6 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 6 (31) the specific criteria for appointing him are laid down in Union law or in national law of the Member States. According to Article 5 (1) (f) of the Data Protection Regulation, personal data shall be processed on a way of ensuring adequate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unauthorized treatment and against loss, destruction or damage by accident, using appropriate technical or organizational measures (integrity and confidentiality). Article 32 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation provides that the person responsible for personal data shall - taking into account the latest developments, implementation costs and the nature, scope, context of the treatment and purposes and the risks, of varying degrees of probability and severity, for rights and freedoms of natural persons - take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security in relation to the risk. This includes, in accordance with Article 32 (1), points (b) and (d) the Data Protection Regulation, where appropriate, - the ability to continuously ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of treatment systems and services, and a procedure for regularly testing, examining and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures to be ensured the safety of treatment. Recital 74 of the Data Protection Regulation states: Personal data controllers should be held responsible for all processing of personal data which they perform or which is performed on their behalf. Personal data controllers should in particular be required to take appropriate and effective measures and be able to show that the treatment is compatible with it Regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. One should within these measures take into account the nature, extent, context and purposes and the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. According to Article 35, a data controller shall make an assessment of a planned processing implications for the protection of personal data, in particular whether a treatment is to be carried out with new technology and taking into account its nature, scope, context and purpose are likely to lead to a high risk of Page 7 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 7 (31) rights and freedoms of natural persons. This includes in accordance with Article 35 (3) b that an impact assessment pursuant to Article 35 (1) shall be required in particular in cases processing takes place on a large scale of specific categories of data such as referred to in Article 9 (1) or of personal data relating to convictions in criminal cases and infringements referred to in Article 10. 2.2 The responsibility for personal data What the Education Board in the city of Stockholm stated during the proceedings The Board of Education in the City of Stockholm is responsible for personal data for them personal data processing that has taken place in the subsystems Children and student register (module) Compulsory school monitoring, Student documentation, Start page and the Administration Interface. However, the Board of Education is not personal data controller for the personal data processing that has taken place in the latter subsystem within the framework of preschool activities and adult education. The Board of Education currently uses a number of systems and e-services as part of its educational and administrative activities. The committee is responsible for operation and development of municipal activities in preschool, primary school, special primary school, after-school center, upper secondary school and upper secondary special school. The Board of Education is ultimately responsible for how its own operations handles the information. Furthermore, the board is responsible for the information protected in accordance with the city's guidelines for information security and data protection legislation, such as the Data Protection Regulation. The Municipal Board is responsible for the system meeting the requirements for security and is the system owner. Following a decision by the council, the entire responsibility for the School Platform was transferred to the Board of Education from 1 January 2020. This means that The Board of Education is both a system owner and an information owner. The Data Inspectorate's assessment Nothing in the case contradicts the Board of Education's finding that they are relevant processing of personal data covered by this supervision has taken place the purpose of the Board of Education's to conduct municipal school activities. The same also applies to the Board of Education's view that it is The Board of Education in the city of Stockholm, which is responsible for personal data for them personal data processing that has taken place in the subsystems Children and student register (module) Compulsory school monitoring, Student documentation, Start page and the Administration Interface. The current supervision does not cover Page 8 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 8 (31) personal data processing that has taken place within the framework of preschool activities and adult education, therefore the question falls on personal data responsibility for the latter processing outside the current one supervision. 2.3 Compulsory school monitoring What the Education Board in the city of Stockholm stated during the proceedings General information about compulsory schooling The school platform consists of six subsystems and the Children and Pupils' Register constitutes one of these subsystems. There are 101 modules in the Children and Pupil Register that are divided into eight process areas. Compulsory schooling is one of the eight the process areas in the Children and Pupil Register. The process area Compulsory schooling supports the work with compulsory schooling within municipal primary schools and regarding pupils in independent schools there The City of Stockholm is a home municipality. The function also includes the processes around the municipal activity responsibility. The administrative system support is used to fulfill the Board of Education's obligations regarding compulsory schooling according to the Education Act (2010: 800) as well as handling and decisions in matters linked to this (mainly according to Chapter 7 of the Education Act but also Chapter 24, Section 23). The Administrative responsibility involves ensuring that students within a certain geographical area will be located at a school near the home. The module Compulsory school monitoring processes data on 1,322 active people compulsory schooling (number of registered) of which 83 students are under seven years. Of These 1,322 active compulsory school guards have 60 students protected personal data. The personal data that is processed in the current module are, among other things. a. name, address, mother tongue, school placement, guardians and contact information for these (telephone number and e-mail address) as well as history of school placement and contacts. Decisions containing personal data are also processed regarding a specific pupil where compulsory schooling has ceased, continued supervision (eg imposition of a fine or case with the Swedish Tax Agency), consent to fulfill compulsory schooling in another way and deferred compulsory schooling (special reasons). The module contains information that a student goes to a resource school or special primary school. Page 9 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 9 (31) Technical deficiencies On October 5, 2018, it was discovered that all users who had authorization to the module Compulsory schooling had the opportunity to see all classified 4 students without school placement. This deficiency is said to be due to the system lacked logic to in the functionality of compulsory school monitoring restrict the access of classified persons. The reason for that is unknown. When the module was implemented in July 2017, the Board of Education had no knowledge of any deficiencies. Compulsory school surveillance in the city municipal primary and lower secondary schools are based on residential areas. Privacy marked people who are unplaced do not have a living area in the system. The routine is that employees at the schools should not be able to see these students then this processing only happens centrally. Number of users who could potentially have been mistaken classified persons are 1,302. The Board is only aware that a school administrator incorrectly viewed the information about students marked with privacy. He must have found three students marked with secrecy in the search results. The there were a total of 60 students with confidentiality marking in compulsory schooling. It has It has not been possible to obtain the exact number of users with log history who had unauthorized access in practice because there are no specific logs for the module Compulsory school monitoring. When the defect was discovered on October 5, 2018, it was not verified by users saw more information than they were authorized to see. On 5 November 2018, ie. one month after discovery, the board was able to verify that users saw more information than they were authorized to see. The supplier worked out a correction which went into production on November 9, 2018. Organizational shortcomings Regarding the allocation of qualifications in the Compulsory School Surveillance, the board has stated that there are eight role holders with different qualifications; - Gr system manager Sthlm, - Gr Administrator Remuneration Sthlm, - Gr Titta Sthlm, - Gr Administrator Language Center Sthlm, - Gr PMO-responsible Sthlm, 4 Confidential persons refer to students with protected personal data. Page 10 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 1 0 (31) - Gr Administrator School Sthlm, - Gr compulsory schooling Central Admin Sthlm - Gr Look Economy Sthlm. The Board stated that four 5 of the eight aforementioned role holders are not need to have the access to compulsory schooling that they have. This is because that the education administration cannot see that these role holders need to have access to compulsory schooling or that it is not guaranteed that the role only has access to the tasks required to perform the tasks. The administration has therefore requested that this be adjusted. The Data Inspectorate's assessment The nature of the personal data and requirements for security The Data Inspectorate initially states that in the module Compulsory school monitoring processes information about students, such as name, address, social security numbers, guardians and contact information for these (telephone number and e-mail address), mother tongue, municipality, school location (school and grade), history of school placement and contact persons (name, address, social security number, telephone number and e-mail). It is also treated information about students who have a protected identity. Furthermore, personal data in some decisions are treated in the module as continued monitoring of a specific student relating to the imposition of a fine or investigation or matter with the Swedish Tax Agency, consent to fulfill compulsory schooling in another way (filming, Nordic schooling or travel abroad) and deferred compulsory schooling (special reasons). The Data Inspectorate considers that information on protected identity is extensive worthy of protection / privacy as the risks to the data subjects' freedoms and rights are great when processing this personal data. Information that a student attends resource school or special primary school which is also treated in Compulsory school surveillance is a sensitive personal task 6 as it reveals information about health. In view of the nature and nature of the personal data processing which has taken place in the Compulsory School Surveillance and the risks to the data subjects' freedoms 5 Gr Administrator Remuneration Sthlm, Gr Administrator Language Center Sthlm, Gr PMO- responsible Sthlm and Gr Look Economy Sthlm. 6, Article 9 of the data protection regulation. Page 11 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 1 1 (31) and rights, the Data Inspectorate considers that high demands are placed on the technical ones and organizational measures that the Board of Education had to take to ensure an appropriate level of safety in accordance with Article 32 i the Data Protection Regulation. Technical deficiencies The investigation in the case shows that unauthorized persons have been able to come to privacy-sensitive personal data concerning students with protected identities. Because there is no log follow-up in the module Compulsory schooling is not possible to state the exact number afterwards users who have had unauthorized access to this information. The The technical shortage in compulsory schooling that has now been examined has meant that Potentially 1,302 users have been able to access personal data without authorization regarding 60 students with a protected identity. The reason for this depends on the committee on weaknesses in the system that made restriction of eligibility impossible to information about students with protected identities. There is no information on when the shortage occurred but the module was implemented in July 2017 and the shortage was discovered on October 5, 2018. Organizational shortcomings The Data Inspectorate's inspection of the subsystem in question concerns both the requirements on technical measures and organizational measures in accordance with Article 32. Av The investigation in the case also shows that the allocation of competence in Compulsory school monitoring is more extensive than is necessary in in relation to what each role holder needs to perform theirs tasks. The Board of Education has stated that a review of the eight the eligibility roles will be initiated shortly. Overall assessment Both the fact that unauthorized persons had access to / have been able to access privacy-sensitive personal data concerning students with protected identity and that there is a more extensive access to data in Compulsory schooling than necessary is contrary to Article 32 (1) the Data Protection Regulation. According to Article 32 (1), the Board of Education shall include taking into account recent developments, implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment and the risks of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security in in relation to the risk. Page 12 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 1 2 (31) The Data Inspectorate assesses that an appropriate security in this case includes one ability to continuously ensure the confidentiality of treatment systems and services. Because the board has allocated more extensively authorizations and that unauthorized persons have gained access to personal data about students with a protected identity, it is the Data Inspectorate's assessment that the Board of Education has failed in its ability to continuously ensure confidentiality of the data processed in the processing systems and - services as required by Article 32 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. The requirement of adequate security also includes having a procedure for regularly test, examine and evaluate the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures taken to ensure the safety of treatment which has not been the case here either. The Data Inspectorate finds that if the Board of Education had had such a procedure to regularly test, examine and evaluate the effectiveness of the measures taken the board has been able to ensure / discover whether the technical measures are correct in accordance with the organizational measures taken. As for it the lack of organization (the extensive competence) is also according to The Data Inspectorate's assessment is such a shortcoming in the authorization restriction which should have been discovered if the Board of Education had regularly checked the authorization. This too is a shortcoming in the requirements for appropriate security pursuant to Article 32 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. The Board of Education in the City of Stockholm has summarized personal data in the module Compulsory school monitoring in the School Platform in violation of Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate also assesses that the Board of Education has considered personal data in breach of Article 5 (1) (f) of the Data Protection Regulation thereof current subsystem. This is because the board has not ensured a suitable one security of personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unauthorized use treatment through the use of appropriate technical measures. Page 13 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 1 3 (31) 2.4 The student documentation What the Education Board in the city of Stockholm stated during the proceedings General information about the Student Documentation The student documentation is one of six subsystems that the School Platform consists of. In the subsystem Student Documentation there are a total of 464,611 registered, of which 122,699 are students in municipal primary and secondary school. Of these students has 787 protected personal data. There are 233,066 in this subsystem registered guardians and 34,756 employees (some of these employees works in childcare and adult education not covered by supervision). The personal data that is processed in the current subsystem are, among other things. a. rating, result on national tests, reporting of results to Statistics Sweden, Statistics Sweden, assessment support that involves documentation of the student's level of knowledge, information that some students need extra adaptations, documentation around investigations and action programs, personal data for the work with development talks and written assessments. Technical deficiencies On August 21, 2019, a guardian was discovered via a thread on Twitter had discovered a data leak in the Student Documentation. The person behind The Twitter account has analyzed with its own access and login via Bank ID the traffic and calls between the front-end and back-end systems. 7 The person has then took out parts of these calls and manipulated them in order to do so get over other people's information. 7 The terms are used by the Board of Education in the city of Stockholm and their function can generally described as follows. The separation of front end and back end system simplifies the data process when it comes to multilayer development and maintenance of computer systems. One Front-end systems are mainly used to send questions and requests and receive data from the backend system. It allows users to interact and use one information system. Usually, front-end systems have very limited computational or business logic processing functions and relies on data and functions from the backend system. A front-end system can include or consist of a text or graphic user interface (GUI) and / or a front-end client application connected to the backend system. The backend system manages databases and data processing components and ensures that the responses to the front - end system's requests are retrieved from databases and data processing components. Page 14 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 1 4 (31) The board has stated that when logging in takes place in the Student Documentation in The school platform is exposed to personal data through an API 8 . Due to a technical lack of API could people, with some knowledge of network systems and programming, monitor calls made from a logged in client mode, copy and modify them. In this way, new calls and personal data could be made which would not be available to the person became available. This means that personal data was available depending on what requests an individual made did, regardless of eligibility. This in turn gave access to personal data without correct authorization. This shortcoming has meant that unauthorized persons have been able to access it the following information about other students: first name, last name, social security number, school type (eg special primary school), year, school ID, class, student's assessment from module development calls, whether it is an integrated user or not as well migrated IUP 9 documents from the School Web. All registered guardians in the School Platform have because of it current shortage had the opportunity to unauthorized access to information. According to the Board of Education, a person has taken advantage of this opportunity and done paging of 101 unique people. The shortcoming has existed since the subsystem was launched. The module where the shortage existed has been in operation since 26 October 2018 . This deficiency had not been detected in previous function and safety tests before the function was put into production. The deficiency in the subsystem was remedied by code changes that were completed during November 2019 . The student documentation was closed after the shortage was discovered until all detected deficiencies were rectified. 8 , an application programming interface (API) is a set of protocols, procedures, functions and / or commands that programmers use to develop software or facilitate interaction between different systems. APIs are usually useful for programming GUI components (graphical user interface), as well as for a program to request and provide services from another program. 9 Individual development plan. Page 15 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 1 5 (31) The Data Inspectorate's assessment Security requirements The Data Inspectorate initially states that in the subsystem Student documentation in the School Platform is extensive personal data processing involving thousands of students, guardians and teacher. According to Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation, health information is so-called sensitive personal data according to the Data Protection Regulation. In preparatory work, Processing of personal data in the field of education (Bill 2017/18: 218 p.57) states the following: As mentioned above, sensitive personal data is further processed health when examining admission to the special primary school, special school, upper secondary special school, and special education for adults according to 7, 18 and 21 Cape. the Education Act. Even an indication that a student goes to such a school is one sensitive task. The Data Inspectorate further states that in the subsystem Student documentation data relating to students' health are treated as data contained in various inquiries about students, special adaptations, etc. Also information about that some students go to a special school involves the treatment of sensitive personal data . In addition, extensive personal data processing is added in The student documentation that does not constitute sensitive personal data according to the Data Protection Regulation but is to be regarded as extra privacy sensitive such as information relating to assessments and data from development interviews. In view of the scope of the personal data processing that takes place in the Student Documentation subsystem, the nature and nature of the treatments and the risks to the data subjects' freedoms and rights, the Data Inspectorate considers that very high demands should be placed on the technical measures to be taken to ensure an appropriate level of safety in accordance with Article 32 i the Data Protection Regulation. Page 16 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 1 6 (31) Assessment of technical measures The technical shortcoming in the Student Documentation that is now being examined has meant that unauthorized persons have been able to access other people's personal data through to monitor calls made from a logged in client mode, copy and modify them. In this way, new calls could be made and personal data not would be available became available. According to the Board of Education information could be accessed by unauthorized persons, e.g. a. other people's first names, surname, social security number, type of school (eg special primary school), year, school ID, class and students' assessments from the module development conversations. This technical shortage has meant that all registered guardians in the School Platform has had the opportunity to unauthorized access to information about all registered students, including sensitive and privacy-sensitive information concerning students. The Data Inspectorate notes that the technical security measures that have taken in the subsystem The student documentation in the School Platform has been deficient as unauthorized persons have been able to easily access comprehensive sensitive and privacy-sensitive personal data concerning thousands of students. The Board of Education has thus breached its obligation pursuant to Article 32 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, taking into account the latest development, implementation costs and the nature, scope of treatment, context and purpose and the risks to the rights of natural persons and freedoms, take appropriate technical measures to ensure a level of security which is appropriate in relation to the risk. The current technical deficiency which is now being examined in the subsystem According to the Swedish Data Inspectorate's assessment, the student documentation should have detected at an early stage, before the processing of personal data was started. The Data Inspectorate considers that an appropriate security in this case includes an ability to continuously ensure the confidentiality of treatment systems and services. The requirement of adequate security also includes having a procedure for regularly test, examine and evaluate the effectiveness of the technical the measures taken to ensure the safety of the treatment. That it current technical deficiency was discovered by a guardian long after subsystem The student documentation was launched, shows that the Board of Education neither has ensured to continuously ensure confidentiality in this subsystem or had a procedure to regularly test, examine and Page 17 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 1 7 (31) evaluate the effectiveness of the technical measures taken in a way that: meets the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate finds that this too is a shortcoming in the requirements for appropriate security under Article 32 (1) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. In summary, the Board of Education in the city of Stockholm has dealt with this personal information in the Student Documentation which is part of the School Platform in in breach of Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate also assesses that the Board of Education has considered personal data in the subsystem in question in breach of Article 5 (1) (fi) the Data Protection Regulation. This is because the board has not secured one appropriate security for personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unauthorized treatment using appropriate technical measures. 2.5 Home page What the Education Board in the city of Stockholm has stated during the proceedings General about the Home page The start page is one of the six subsystems that the School Platform consists of. A module in the subsystem The start page is called ""contacts"" where personal information from School Data Sync Database (SDS DB) is processed, which in turn retrieves information from the child and student register subsystem. Personal data is processed to ensure guardians' access to information about the right school and class based on the connection between guardians and children / pupils and children / pupils connection to classes / groups. This is controlled based on information in Children and student register. Among the personal data processed in the Home Page are students and teachers name, e-mail address, school connection, connection to groups, connection to departments, mentor groups and courses. Data on is also processed guardian's name, social security number, address, e-mail address, telephone number and connection to children. In the subsystem Start page, there are a total of 440,695 registered, of which 31,847 are employees, 233,062 guardians and 122,699 students in municipal primary and lower secondary school and high school. Page 18 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 1 8 (31) Technical shortage On June 27, 2019, a new functionality was introduced on the Home page there guardians could apply for other guardians with children in the same class provided that the guardians have consented to it. August 24th In 2019, it was discovered that the technical measures had failed then one guardians by changing calls in the developer tool in their browser with the help of social security numbers could search for other guardians who were registered on the Home Page. The shortage has meant that everyone registered guardians in the School Platform have had the opportunity to take part in unauthorized access information. This shortcoming has existed since the new functionality was introduced in June 2019. The Board of Education has identified a guardian who has access unauthorized information about seven unique people. None of those affected had a protected identity. The technical deficiency was remedied on the day it was discovered, on 24 August 2019, through a code change that was produced. The Data Inspectorate's assessment Security requirements The Data Inspectorate initially states that in the subsystem Start page in The school platform carries out extensive personal data processing that concerns thousands of students, guardians and teachers. It is treated differently information such as guardian's social security number, address, e-mail address, telephone number and connection to children. In view of the scope of the personal data processing that takes place in the home system subsystem, the nature and nature of the treatments and the risks to them The data inspectorate's freedoms and rights, the Data Inspectorate considers that high demands should technical measures to be taken to ensure an appropriate security level in accordance with Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. The assessment of technical measures The technical shortcoming in Startsidan, which is now being examined, has meant that guardians by changing calls in the developer tool in their browser with the help of social security numbers could search for other guardians who are registered on the Home page. This means that guardians have on one easily accessed unauthorized by other guardians personal data. The Board of Education has thus breached its obligation Page 19 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 1 9 (31) pursuant to Article 32 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, taking into account the latest development, implementation costs and the nature, scope of treatment, context and purpose and the risks to the rights of natural persons and freedoms, take appropriate technical measures to ensure a level of security which is appropriate in relation to the risk in the subsystem in question. The Data Inspectorate assesses that an appropriate security in this case includes one ability to continuously ensure the confidentiality of treatment systems and services. The current technical shortage should according to The Data Inspectorate's assessment has been discovered at an early stage before the processing of personal data began. That the current shortage was discovered by a guardian after the launch of the Startup subsystem, shows that the Board of Education also did not have a procedure that fulfills the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation to regularly test, examine and evaluate the effectiveness of the technical measures taken. This too is lack of appropriate security requirements under Article 32 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. The Board of Education in the city of Stockholm has thus dealt with personal data in the subsystem in question in breach of Article 32 i the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate further assesses that the Board of Education in the city of Stockholm has processed the personal data in the current subsystem in violation of the article 5.1 in the Data Protection Ordinance because the board has not ensured one appropriate security for personal data, including protection against unauthorized or illicit treatment. 2.6 The administration interface What the Education Board in the city of Stockholm has stated during the proceedings General information about the Administration Interface The administration interface was common to the two subsystems Absence / Attendance and Schedule in the School Platform, where settings for these subsystems are executed. The system read data from the Children and Pupil Register which is the source system for basic data in the current subsystem. The data were administered in this interface and was then shown to users in various interfaces based on the role of the system and depending on the settings made. The administration interface was not intended for guardians. People with Page 20 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 2 0 (31) a combination of roles such as teacher or chancellor who is also guardians had no access to the information linked to the role guardian when logging in to this interface. People who only had however, the role of guardian was given when logging in to the Administration Interface access to data linked to own children. Among the personal data handled are name, social security number, e-mail, telephone number, department or group / class affiliation, teacher connection to group / class / department, lesson information (group / class / subject / course, room and time), absence data (presence / absence, reason for absence, valid / invalid) and the application for leave. Technical deficiencies On August 26, 2019, it was discovered that guardians through a search on Google found links to login to the Administration Interface there guardians should not be able to log in. The current shortage has meant that guardians have been able to produce reports for ""Contact information teachers"" where name, e-mail address and work telephone number are displayed. Furthermore, the interface has not been shown to be adapted for handling classified information tasks. Individuals with protected identities have not had a marking as reveals this. This means that people with protected identities can have covered by the current deficiency, but that these can not be distinguished from the others registered. The shortcoming has existed since the function was launched, probably since August 2017 . It was discovered internally on 19 November 2018 and was then assessed by the Board of Education be trivial because the inquiry then claimed that no data that the guardian could not see in another interface was shown. The differences that existed e.g. access to ""Contact Information-Teacher"", was then said to only show the student's current teacher and what subjects they have with them eleven. It was also said that no contact details were shown. The shortage would be solved with a code merger which was then planned in 2019. The release as the correction would be covered by early 2019, however, is postponed to the future. The personal data that was displayed as a result of the current deficiency is contact information for teachers, such as name, class, school, subject / course, e- postal address (both work and private address) and telephone number (both work and private number). Page 21 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 2 1 (31) It is not possible to determine how many guardians have logged in to this interface and incorrectly accessed data. It is also not possible to get it how many of the teachers covered by the reports also had their private e- postal address entered in the Children and Pupil Register and which could thus be displayed for unauthorized. The Board of Education cannot state the number of registered as was affected by this technical deficiency. At present, there are between 50 and 60 teachers which have a protected identity in this subsystem. The Board of Education can not nor appreciate what the current shortage has meant for the data subjects as the board has not received any indications of consequences. After the vulnerability was discovered and could be confirmed, Stockholm requested city ​​on 26 August 2019 that the supplier would close the access for caregiver. The subsystem was shut down and is no longer in operation. The Data Inspectorate's assessment Security requirements The Data Inspectorate initially states that in the Administration Interface data concerning teachers were processed, such as e-mail address (both work and private address) and telephone number (both work and private numbers). The data on teachers with protected identities were also processed. As previously mentioned, the Data Inspectorate considers that information concerning persons with protected identities are very worthy of protection / privacy sensitive then the risks for the data subjects' freedoms and rights are great in processing them personal data. Given the nature and nature of the personal data processing that has taken place in the Administration Interface and the risks to the data subjects' freedoms and rights, the Data Inspectorate considers that high demands be placed on the technical measures to be taken to ensure an appropriate level of safety in accordance with Article 32 i the Data Protection Regulation. The assessment of technical measures In the Administration Interface, guardians have via Google search been able to find links for logging in to the Administration interface there guardians should not be able to log in. In this interface have guardians been able to produce information on e.g. a. teachers' private contact details such as email address and private phone numbers. This interface has also been proven not be adapted for handling data on individuals with protected Page 22 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 2 2 (31) identity. This means that unauthorized persons have been able to access information on persons with a protected identity. Because the current shortage has meant that unauthorized persons have had possibility to access information about persons with a protected identity the Board of Education has breached its obligation under Article 32 (1) (i) the Data Protection Regulation that, taking into account recent developments, implementation costs and the nature, scope, context of the treatment and purposes and the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons appropriate technical measures to ensure an appropriate level of safety in relation to the risk. The Data Inspectorate assesses that an appropriate security in this case includes one ability to continuously ensure the confidentiality of treatment systems and services. The current technical shortage should according to The Data Inspectorate's assessment has been discovered at an early stage before the processing of personal data began. The mentioned shortcoming has has been around for a long time since the system was launched. The Board of Education was made aware of the shortcoming in November 2018, but chose not to remedy it until the deficiency was rediscovered in August 2019. The Board of Education has thus breached the necessity of continuously ensure confidentiality in the current interface. The requirement of Appropriate security also includes having a procedure to regularly test, investigate and evaluate the effectiveness of the technical measures taken measures to ensure the safety of treatment, which neither has in this case in the light of the foregoing. The Board of Education in the city of Stockholm has thus dealt with personal data in the subsystem in question in breach of Article 32 i the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate also assesses in this part that the Board of Education has processed personal data in the current interface in violation of Article 5 (1) (fi) the Data Protection Ordinance because the board has not ensured an appropriate security of personal data. Page 23 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 2 3 (31) 2.7 Impact assessment What the Education Board in the city of Stockholm stated during the proceedings The Board of Education states that since the Children and Pupil Register production was launched before 25 May 2018 has no comprehensive impact assessment under Article 35 of the Data Protection Regulation yet implemented. On the other hand, impact assessments have been carried out continuously as new functionalities have been added. The committee believes that an impact assessment needs to be made and work on this is ongoing and will be completed in December 2020. The vulnerabilities that have detected during penetration tests has been promptly remedied. The Board of Education has further stated that it is working with one risk management plan, where what is discovered in risk and impact assessments systematically addressed in accordance with the city's risk matrix and that objective is that there will soon be active risk management for the whole The school platform. The Board of Education has a developed process for that ensure adequate information security that involves risk and impact assessments shall be carried out Regarding the Administration Interface, there will be no impact assessment to be done for this part because the interface has been discontinued and is no longer in use. The Data Inspectorate's assessment In the subsystems and modules that have been the subject of the Data Inspectorate review treats students, school staff and guardians personal data of varying degrees of sensitivity. The current subsystems covered of the supervision in question involves the treatment of a large number personal data of a large number of data subjects, who are largely children, who in the Data Protection Regulation is highlighted as vulnerable natural persons 10 . The Data Inspectorate states that in the relevant subsystems there is extensive personal data processing with different types of personal data such as grades, inquiries about students, development talks, special adaptations, children and adults with a protected identity. Furthermore, sensitive people are also treated personal data to a certain extent, ie. specific categories of data such as referred to in Article 9 (1) as health information. It is thus a question of one 10 See recital 75 of the Data Protection Regulation. Page 24 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 2 4 (31) comprehensive personal data processing if a large number of registered in the system. The Data Inspectorate states that it is a question of a treatment as with consideration of its nature, scope, context and purpose is likely to lead to a high risk to natural persons rights and freedoms in such a way which requires that the Board of Education should have implemented one impact assessment in accordance with Article 35 of the Data Protection Regulation. By article 35.3 (b) further states that an impact assessment under paragraph 1 in particular shall be required in the case of large-scale treatment of special categories of data referred to in Article 9 (1). The Data Inspectorate states that the processing of personal data in the relevant subsystems is of it the nature set out in Article 35 (3) (b) of the Data Protection Regulation, which is a circumstance which in particular requires an impact assessment. The Data Inspectorate has, on the basis of guidelines from Article 29- working group and the criteria developed by the group 11 , adopted one list of when an impact assessment is to be made. 12 In addition to the situations referred to in Article 35 (3) of the Data Protection Regulation, and taking into account the derogation in Article 35 (10), an impact assessment shall regarding data protection is made if the planned processing meets at least two of the nine criteria mentioned in the list. In this case, sensitive data or data is processed by a lot personal nature, large-scale information and vulnerable information registered which are three of nine criteria that according to the list suggest that an impact assessment shall be carried out. Furthermore, the list indicates when an impact assessment is not required. The no impact assessment is required for treatments that have checked by a regulatory authority or a data protection officer in accordance 11 Guidelines on impact assessment regarding data protection and determining whether the treatment ""is likely to lead to a high risk"" within the meaning of the Regulation 2016/679, last revised and adopted on 4 October 2017, WP 248 rev. 01. 2 (6) http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item\_id=611236 . The The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has approved the guidelines on 25 May 2018 https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/files/news/endorsement\_of\_wp29\_documents.pdf. 12 List according to Article 35 (4) of the Data Protection Ordinance, no. DI-2018-13200 Page 25 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 2 5 (31) with Article 20 of Directive 95/46 / EC and the implementation of which has not changed since previous control. As a good practice, however, one should impact assessment is reviewed continuously and evaluated regularly. The Data Inspectorate finds that there is no circumstance that suggests that an impact assessment is not required. In the 29-group guidelines specify that even if an impact assessment is not required on 25 May In 2018, it is necessary for the person responsible for personal data to perform one impact assessment, at an appropriate time and as part of its general liability. 13 The Data Inspectorate states that the processing of personal data takes place in the current subsystems in the School Platform is likely to lead to a high risk of the rights and freedoms of natural persons in such a way that a impact assessment under Article 35 of the Data Protection Regulation implemented in the respective subsystems covered by this supervision, in order to: assess the consequences of the planned treatment for the protection of personal data in accordance with Article 35. The fact that the system was launched before 25 May 2018 does not affect the assessment of the inspectorate. The Board of Education states that the reason for that the current deficiencies that caused the incidents that occurred in the respective subsystem not discovered before is that no comprehensive impact assessment has been performed. In the current review, the Data Inspectorate has assessed that it has existed technical deficiencies in several subsystems covered by the supervision. The inspection has also assessed that the eligibility allocations have been more extensive in it the module where the issue has been examined (Compulsory school monitoring). Against the background of the Board of Education's own information that has emerged in the case regarding impact assessment, the Data Inspectorate considers that the Board of Education, during the period 25 May 2018 until 27 August 2020, has not implemented one impact assessment covering the compulsory schooling subsystems, Student Documentation, Home Page and Administration Interface in its whole. If the board had made a complete impact assessment, so the deficiencies found could probably have been avoided. The Board of Education has thus not carried out an impact assessment that meets the requirements of 13 Guidelines on impact assessment regarding data protection and determining whether the treatment ""is likely to lead to a high risk"" within the meaning of the Regulation 2016/679, last revised and adopted on 4 October 2017, WP 248 rev. 01. 2 (6) pp. 15- 16 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item\_id=611236 Page 26 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 2 6 (31) Article 35 of the subsystems concerned and has thus dealt with personal data in violation of the current provision. 3. Choice of intervention 3.1 Possible intervention measures The Data Inspectorate has a number of corrective powers available according to Article 58 (2) (a) to (j) of the Data Protection Regulation, inter alia to impose it personal data controllers to ensure that the processing takes place in accordance with Regulation and, if necessary, in a specific way and within a specific period. Of point (i) of Article 58 (2) and Article 83 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation it appears that the Data Inspectorate has the authority to impose administrative penalty fees in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the circumstances of in the individual case, administrative penalty fees shall be imposed in addition to or in instead of the other measures referred to in Article 58 (2). Furthermore, Article 83 (2) sets out the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether: administrative penalty fees shall be imposed and in determining the size of the fee. If it is a question of a minor violation, the Data Inspectorate receives according to what set out in recital 148 of the Data Protection Regulation instead of imposing a issue a reprimand in accordance with Article 58 (2) (b) the Data Protection Regulation. Account must be taken of aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, such as the nature of the infringement, the severity and duration and previous breaches of relevance. For authorities, according to Article 83 (7), national supplementary provisions are introduced regarding administrative sanction fees. Of ch. 6 § 2 The Data Protection Act states that the supervisory authority may charge a penalty fee by an authority in the event of infringements referred to in Article 83 (4), (5) and (6) the Data Protection Regulation. In that case, Article 83 (1), (2) and (3) of the Regulation shall apply apply. Page 27 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 2 7 (31) 3.2 Order The Data Inspectorate has found that the Board of Education in the city of Stockholm, by having a more extensive allocation of competencies than necessary in the subsystem / module Compulsory school monitoring, has processed personal data in contrary to Articles 5 (1) (f) and 32 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. Furthermore, it has been established that the Board of Education, although impact assessments have been carried out continuously as new functionalities have has not met the requirements for carrying out an impact assessment in in accordance with Article 35 of the Data Protection Regulation. The Board of Education in the City of Stockholm must therefore be instructed to ensure that the processing in these parts takes place in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation according to following. The Data Inspectorate submits to the Board of Education, on the basis of Article 58 (2) (d) in the Data Protection Regulation, to limit authorization allocations in the module Compulsory school supervision for those people who have a need for treatment the personal data to perform their tasks in the current module. The Data Inspectorate also submits it to the Board of Education, with the support of an article 58.2 of the Data Protection Regulation, to implement one as soon as possible impact assessment in the compulsory schooling subsystems, The student documentation and the start page for guardians who meet the requirements of Article 35 of the Data Protection Regulation. 3.3 A penalty fee shall be imposed The Data Inspectorate has above assessed that the Board of Education in the relevant subsystems have infringed Article 5 and Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. These articles are covered by Article 83 (4) and 83 (5) respectively and in the event of an infringement of these, the supervisory authority shall consider imposing administrative penalty fee in addition to, or instead of, other corrective measures. In view of the fact that they identified infringements in the subsystems Compulsory schooling, Student documentation, Administration interface and The home page has touched a very large number of registrants including children and students, and included shortcomings in the handling of sensitive and privacy-sensitive personal data, including data on persons with a protected identity, information about health, grades, etc., it is not a question of a minor violation. Page 28 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 2 8 (31) There is thus no reason to replace the sanction fee with a reprimand. The Board of Education shall thus be subject to administrative penalty fees. 3.4 Determination of the amount of the penalty fee General provisions According to Article 83 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, each supervisory authority shall: ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty fees in each individual cases are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. For authorities, according to ch. § 2 second paragraph of the Data Protection Act that the penalty fees shall be set at a maximum of SEK 5,000,000 at infringements referred to in Article 83 (4) of the Data Protection Regulation and up to a maximum of 10 SEK 000 000 for infringements referred to in Article 83 (5) and 83 (6). Violations of Article 5 are subject to the higher penalty fee under Article 83 (5), while infringements of Articles 32 and 35 are covered by the lower the maximum amount in accordance with Article 83 (4). Article 83 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation sets out the factors to be taken into account in determining the amount of the penalty fee. When assessing the size of sanction fee shall, among other things. a. account is taken of Article 83 (2) (a) (nature of the infringement, severity and duration), b (intent or negligence), g (categories of personal data), h (how the violation came to the Data Inspectorate knowledge) and k (another aggravating or mitigating factor for example direct or indirect financial gain) in the Data Protection Regulation. Assessment of mitigating and aggravating circumstances In the Data Inspectorate's assessment of the penalty fee, account has been taken of the fact that there have been infringements concerning several articles of the Data Protection Regulation, whereby infringement of Article 5 is to be judged as more serious and covered by the higher penalty fee. In order for penalty fees to be effective and deterrence, a proportionality assessment must be made in each individual case. A personal data controller must ensure before launching a new system appropriate security. The requirements for the personal data controller and the measures that taken to ensure adequate security must be set high when it comes to the issue about a large number of data subjects and especially when it comes to data on for example health and protected personal data, which means sensitive and privacy-sensitive personal data processing takes place. Page 29 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 2 9 (31) In the present case, special consideration has been given to the Board of Education in the City of Stockholm has processed a large amount of personal data in the digital platform used in the city of Stockholm, Skolplattformen, and that the violations have concerned data on a very large number of data subjects, at least above one hundred thousand registered. The current violations have included both privacy-sensitive and sensitive personal data concerning children that are extra worthy of protection. The violations have also meant that unauthorized persons have been able to obtain access to data on persons with a protected identity. This is personal data which by its nature has a high protection value as it can get a lot serious consequences for the individual natural person if unauthorized sheep part of the data. Furthermore, the following aggravating and mitigating circumstances have been weighed into the various subsystems that have been examined. Compulsory school surveillance Adverse circumstances in the module Compulsory schooling are the risks for the lives of individuals caused by unauthorized access to privacy-sensitive personal data concerning approximately 60 students with protected identity. Another aggravating circumstance that the inspectorate has taken into account is that the Board of Education has still not addressed the competencies in module so that each user only has access to the data he needs to perform his duties. The student documentation What have been aggravating circumstances regarding the shortcomings that have found in the Student Documentation is that the technical shortcomings of this supervision covers have enabled unauthorized access to sensitive and much privacy-sensitive personal data concerning at least over one hundred thousand students. All registered guardians have, by that in a relatively simple manipulate the system, had the opportunity to access data such as social security number, information about pupils who attend special school and pupils' grades and reviews. The technical shortcomings in the Student Documentation have outside the investigation in the case has existed for a period longer than six months and was discovered by a guardian. Page 30 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7024 3 0 (31) As an attenuating circumstance, the Education Board's actions have to address the shortcomings after the discovery has been weighed in the assessment of the size of the penalty fee. Home page The technical deficiency in the subsystem The start page has arisen in connection with launch of a new functionality. That which has been aggravating circumstances is that the defect was discovered by a guardian and not by the Board of Education. This indicates that the Board of Education does not have sufficient test seductions when launching new functionalities. As mitigating circumstance, the inspectorate has taken into account the current the shortage has existed for a short period and that the Board of Education remedied the deficiency promptly after the discovery. The administration interface What has been aggravating regarding the shortcomings that have existed in the subsystem The administration interface is that the shortcomings could have led to unauthorized persons had access to data on approximately 50-60 employees with protected identities, which can have very serious consequences for individuals. Other aggravating circumstances that have been taken into account in the assessment of the penalty fee is that the technical deficiencies have existed for a period which exceeds one year and that the Board of Education as in November 2018 was made aware of the shortcomings of the Administration Interface, did not take action until the deficiencies were rediscovered in August 2019. Overall assessment of the size of the penalty fee The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of an overall assessment that The Board of Education in the city of Stockholm must pay an administrative fee a penalty fee of SEK 4,000,000 (four million) for those found the violations in the subsystems Compulsory school surveillance, Student documentation, The administration interface and the Home page for guardians. This decision was made by Director General Lena Lindgren Schelin after presentation by lawyers Salli Fanaei and Ranja Bunni. At the final The case is also handled by the General Counsel Hans-Olof Lindblom, the head of the unit Malin Blixt and the information security specialist Adolf Slama participated.

Administrative penalty fees The Data Inspectorate decides by decision pursuant to Articles 58 (2) and 83 i the Data Protection Ordinance, Chapter 6 Section 2 of the Act (2018: 218) with supplementary provisions of the EU Data Protection Regulation and § 25 point 4 i Camera Surveillance Act (2018: 1200) that Gnosjö Municipality - Social Affairs Committee for 1 Housing with special service according to law (1993: 387) on support and service to certain handicapped. 2 REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on that free flow of such data and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Regulation). Page 4 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 4 (22) infringements of Article 5 (1) (a), Article 6 (1), Article 9 (2), Article 13, Article 35 and Article 36 of the Data Protection Ordinance and Section 15 of the Camera Surveillance Act shall pay an administrative penalty fee of SEK 200,000. Report on the supervisory matter Background On 2 May 2019, the Data Inspectorate received a report from another relative a resident of an LSS residence in Gnosjö municipality according to which the social committee in Gnosjö municipality (hereinafter the social committee) processes personal data through to camera monitor a resident at one of the municipality's LSS homes. According to notification, the social committee must have stated that the camera surveillance takes place with support of an approval / consent from the resident's family and former trustee of the resident. There is no approval / consent according to the submitter of the notification. The Data Inspectorate has due to the information that the notification contains initiated supervision for the purpose of reviewing the processing of personal data which the social committee must have carried out through camera surveillance is in accordance with the data protection rules and the camera surveillance law. The supervisory case began with a supervisory letter on 15 July 2019. Answer to The supervisory letter was received on 21 August 2019. Supplementary letters from The Social Affairs Committee has been received on 2 December 2019, 11 May 2020, 12 August 2020 and November 4, 2020. What has emerged in the case The Social Affairs Committee has processed personal data by real-time camera monitor a resident of an LSS residence in order to increase the security of it accommodation. The camera was installed in March 2019 and surveillance ceased on the 29th April 2020 in connection with the business being taken over by another contractor. The Social Affairs Committee has stated the following. The resident has lived in the LSS accommodation since the autumn of 2013. He needs support in his everyday life around the clock from two people, when he exposes himself to serious self-harming behavior and needs help to prevent this. In emotionally difficult situations, he wants to be himself in his own bedroom with closed door, the staff has then been in the living room and been prepared to enter if necessary. It has happened that it has become completely quiet inside Page 5 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 5 (22) at the resident's and when staff have opened the door to see how they are doing he slept but was awakened when the door was opened. The resident has then again become emotionally upset and risk of self-harming behavior has existed. At others On several occasions it has happened that the resident seriously injured himself without staff have heard something. During the resident's first time at the LSS accommodation, there were periodically three staff members service, despite this, it happened several times to both the resident and the staff was injured. There have been such serious incidents that it has involved one great danger to her life. After the staff group has received both training and guidance, the business decided that it is better for the resident to only have two staff on duty around the clock and they have been working since the spring 2014. The staff has noticed that when the resident becomes anxious and shows signs of wanting to harm themselves, staff or things, it passes more quickly if they lets him be alone in his bedroom. Since the camera was installed, there have been no serious incidents when the resident has been alone in the bedroom. The staff was able to quickly pay attention to what he had in mind and they have not had to disturb when he came to rest. The fact that the camera is installed does not mean a reduction of the number of staff on duty; they are always double-staffed around the clock. The camera is only used in real time to see how the resident is feeling, nothing material is saved. There is also no sound recording. If the resident wants staff inside their room, the staff is there and the camera is not used. Justification of decision Personal data manager The Social Affairs Committee has stated that the Social Affairs Committee is responsible for personal data the processing of personal data that has taken place through camera surveillance of a home in one of the municipality's LSS homes. This is supported by the inquiry where it appears that it is the Social Affairs Committee that decides on camera surveillance and specific purpose and means with personal data processing. Page 6 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 6 (22) What rules apply to camera surveillance Camera surveillance is a form of personal data processing. The Camera Surveillance Act (2013: 460), to which the Social Affairs Committee referred, was replaced on 1 August 2018 by the Camera Surveillance Act (2018: 1200) and it now applies in its place. How and to what extent it is allowed to camera surveillance is thus regulated in the Data Protection Regulation and the Camera Surveillance Act (KBL), which supplements the Data Protection Ordinance. Section 2 of the KBL states that the purpose of the law is to meet the need for camera surveillance for legitimate purposes and to protect natural persons against undue invasion of privacy during such surveillance. The definition of camera surveillance in § 3 KBL means, among other things, that it should be a matter of equipment, which without being maneuvered on site, is used on a methods that involve permanent or regular repeated personal surveillance According to § 7 KBL, a permit is required for camera surveillance of a place there the public has access, if the surveillance is to be conducted by an authority. The Social Affairs Committee is an authority and must therefore be based on it permission to camera-monitor a place to which the public has access. The question is then if the public is considered to have access to the seat of the Social Affairs Committee camera guards. Practice shows that the concept of “place where the public has access ”shall be interpreted broadly (see the Supreme Administrative Court's decision RÅ 2000 ref. 52). The Data Inspectorate's assessment The Data Inspectorate states that this is a matter of lasting and regular repeated personal surveillance, with a camera that is not operated on the spot, when the social committee uses camera surveillance and films a resident an LSS home, in his bedroom, in real time. In the light of what has emerged about the location of the surveillance, it living room, the Data Inspectorate assesses that it is not a question of a place to which the public has access. There is thus a requirement to apply for a permit not. The fact that the camera surveillance is unlicensed only means that the rules in the Camera Surveillance Act if a permit for camera surveillance does not apply. Other rules in the Camera Surveillance Act apply just as for those subject to a permit camera surveillance, such as rules on professional secrecy and information and when Page 7 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 7 (22) the camera surveillance includes personal data processing, the rules in the Data Protection Regulation. Basic principles for the processing of personal data (Article 5) Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation contains a number of basic principles which the data controller must take into account when processing personal data. The data controller has, in accordance with Article 5 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation responsibility for compliance with the Regulation and must be able to demonstrate that they basic principles are followed. It follows from Article 5 (1) (a) that all processing of personal data must be lawful; correct and characterized by openness. That the treatment must be correct means that it should be fair, equitable, reasonable and proportionate in relation to them registered. Article 5 (1) (c) regulates the principle of data minimization, which means that: personal data processed to be adequate, relevant and not for extensive in relation to the purposes for which they are treated. It follows from recital 39 that personal data should only be processed for the purpose of the treatment cannot reasonably be achieved by other means. The Data Inspectorate's assessment In assessing whether the treatment is proportionate, the need for to carry out the treatment is weighed against the intrusion into the individual's personal integrity. Regarding the need for processing, the Data Inspectorate can note that the information provided by the Social Affairs Committee shows that it residents' illness creates great difficulties both for themselves and for staff, and that situations have arisen where there has been a risk of the resident's life and health. It has also happened that staff have been added damage. The inquiry into the matter supports the Social Affairs Committee's assessment that it has there has been a need to take action to manage and improve the situation. The problem that has arisen before and that the municipality has managed to curb through the camera surveillance, consists in that when the resident becomes upset is calmed down best by being able to retreat and be alone in the bedroom, while at the same time there is the greatest risk of him injuring himself Page 8 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 8 (22) himself seriously. There has thus been a need to be able to have the resident under supervision without being disturbed by the staff. At the same time, the Data Inspectorate finds that the current camera surveillance means that the resident is monitored by a camera in his bedroom. It is thus a question of a very privacy-sensitive processing of personal data which means that the resident is monitored in the home's most private sphere. The Data Inspectorate assesses that the camera surveillance has entailed a significant intrusion into it residents' privacy. In order for such surveillance to be judged to be an acceptable intrusion into personal integrity, alternative measures must first be ruled out. The Data Inspectorate states that the Social Affairs Committee has previously taken measures in the form of e.g. guidance, to try to improve the situation. It appears however, not by the inquiry that the Social Affairs Committee has tried to fulfill precisely the need to keep the resident under surveillance without risking disturbance; with less intrusive measures than through camera surveillance. According to The Data Inspectorate's assessment should be possible for the Social Affairs Committee to with relatively simple and less intrusive measures same needs as with camera surveillance. Against this background, the Data Inspectorate finds that the Social Affairs Committee does not have shown that the interest in camera surveillance exceeds the resident's right to privacy and a protected private sphere. The Data Inspectorate states that the way in which the camera surveillance was carried out entailed an extensive monitoring of the resident that has led to a significant intervention in the resident privacy. This means that the processing of personal data, ie. camera surveillance, has been disproportionate to the purpose. The processing of personal data that has taken place through the camera surveillance has thus not living up to the requirements of correctness in Article 5 (1) (a) the Data Protection Regulation. As the Data Inspectorate states in the following in the justification under the headings Legal basis for the treatment of personal data (Article 6), Processing of sensitive personal data (Article 9) and Information to the data subjects has the processing of personal data without a legal basis in Article 6 (1), without support in Article 9 (2) and without demonstrated that the resident has received information in accordance with Article 13 of the the regulation and also not in accordance with the requirements of the Camera Surveillance Act. The means that the Social Affairs Committee can also not be considered to have lived up to the requirements in Article 5.1 (a) of the Data Protection Regulation on legality and transparency. Page 9 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 9 (22) Legal basis for the processing of personal data (Article 6) According to Article 5 (1) (a) of the Data Protection Regulation, personal data must be processed legally. In order for the treatment to be considered legal, it is required that at least one of the conditions of Article 6 (1) is met. The Social Affairs Committee has stated that the legal basis applicable to it The current personal data processing is that the processing is necessary to perform a task of general interest in accordance with Article 6 (1) (e) the Data Protection Regulation. The provision of social services is one such information of general interest referred to in Article 6 (1) (e) the legal basis of general interest and the exercise of authority Member States in accordance with Article 6 (2) maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the provisions of Regulation to national circumstances. National law can be closer establish specific requirements for data processing and other measures to: ensure legal and fair treatment. But there is not just one possibility to introduce national rules but also an obligation; Article 6.3 states that the basis for the treatment referred to in paragraph 1 (c) and (e) shall be: determined in accordance with Union law or the national law of the Member States. The legal basis may also contain specific provisions to: adapt the application of the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation. The law of the Union or the national law of the Member States shall fulfill an objective of: public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. This means that additional provisions in national law are required by which the basis for the treatment is determined. Recital 41 states that one legal basis or legislative action should be clear and precise and its application should be predictable for persons covered by it. For the processing of personal data in the activities of the social services is established the basis for the treatment in section 6 of the Act (2001: 454) on the treatment of personal data within the social services (SoLPuL). It is clear from that provision that personal data may only be processed if the processing is necessary to tasks within the social services must be able to be performed. The preparatory work for the Data Protection Act develops what recital 41 entails supplementary national legislation (Bill 2017/18: 105 New Data Protection Act p. 51). Page 10 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 1 0 (22) What degree of clarity and precision is required in terms of it legal basis for a certain processing of personal data should be considered necessary must in the opinion of the Government assessed on a case-by-case basis, based on the treatment and the nature of the business. It should be clear that a treatment of personal data that does not constitute an actual violation of it personal integrity, such as in the treatment of students' names in regular school activities, can be done with the support of a legal basis which is generally held. A more tangible intrusion, for example processing of sensitive personal data in health and healthcare, requires that the legal basis be more precise thus making the intrusion predictable. If the intrusion is significant and involves monitoring or mapping it individual personal circumstances are also required in particular legal support according to ch. 2 6 and 20 §§ RF. This means that the requirements for the supplementary national regulation in terms of precision and predictability increases when it comes to one more tangible intrusion. If the intrusion is significant and involves surveillance or mapping of the individual's personal circumstances, which the current the treatment does, special legal support is also required according to ch. Sections 6 and 20 form of government. The Data Inspectorate's assessment The Data Inspectorate finds that § 6 SoLPuL is a fairly broad and unspecified provision which forms the basis for the processing of personal data in a large number of areas. According to the Swedish Data Inspectorate's assessment, individuals by the provision anticipate that the social services treat large amounts of privacy-sensitive information about individuals in their business, such as for example in case processing. However, it can not be assumed that individuals can anticipate that the Social Services may also perform privacy-sensitive camera surveillance. Against the background of that camera surveillance is an extremely privacy-sensitive treatment and that it thus, high demands are placed on national regulations regarding precision and predictability, the Data Inspectorate assesses that the legal basis in § 6 SoLPuL cannot constitute a supplementary national provision to it the legal basis of Article 6 (1) (e) of the Data Protection Regulation in this case privacy-sensitive camera surveillance. Page 11 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 1 1 (22) In addition, § 6 SoLPuL requires that the treatment is necessary to perform a task within the social services. Regarding the meaning of the term necessary, the following appears from the preparatory work for the Data Protection Act (Bill. 2017/18: 105 p. 51). According to the Swedish Academy's Dictionary, the Swedish word means necessary that something absolutely required or can not omitted. However, the concept of Union law does not have this strict meaning. Necessity requisites in Article 7 i The Data Protection Directive has e.g. not considered to be a requirement that it must be impossible to perform a task of general interest without the treatment measure being taken (Bill 2017/18: 105 p. 46). Even if the necessity requirement does not mean that it should be impossible to perform a task of general interest if the treatment is not carried out, it may according to the Data Inspectorate's assessment is not considered necessary to carry out a privacy-sensitive processing of personal data via camera surveillance if there are other reasonable options for performing one task that serves the same purpose. As the Data Inspectorate previously stated the social committee should be able to live up to the purpose of the camera surveillance in a different way than with just camera surveillance. Thus, neither is the requirement that the treatment shall be necessary for the complementary national the regulation in § 6 SoLPuL shall be applicable fulfilled. The Social Affairs Committee has thus dealt with the camera surveillance personal data without having a legal basis for the processing under Article 6.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. Any other legal basis for the treatment under Article 6 (1) has also not been shown to exist. Processing of sensitive personal data (Article 9) It follows from Article 9 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation that health information constitutes a special category of personal data ( so-called sensitive personal data). The main rule is that the processing of such personal data is prohibited. IN Article 9 (2) sets out a number of exceptions for sensitive personal data treated. The Social Affairs Committee has stated that the camera may monitor situations in which the resident's disease picture and state of health appear. It means Page 12 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 1 2 (22) that the current camera surveillance at the LSS accommodation includes treatment of health information ie. sensitive personal data. In order for a processing of sensitive personal data to be legal, both are required a legal basis under Article 6 (1) and that any of the exceptions to the prohibition the processing of sensitive personal data in Article 9 (2) is applicable. Already it the fact that the Social Affairs Committee has carried out the camera surveillance without having a legal basis for the proceedings under Article 6 (1) means that processing has been in breach of Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation. If, on the other hand, there had been a legal basis for the treatment under Article 6.1, the Social Affairs Committee would thus also have had to apply some of the exceptions in Article 9 (2) for the processing of personal data to be lawful. Article 9 (2) (h) states that the processing of sensitive personal data may take place if the treatment is necessary for reasons related to /… / social care or management of health services and social care and by their system, on the basis of Union law or the national law of the Member States right or under agreements with health professionals and under provided that the conditions and safeguard measures referred to in paragraph 3 are fulfilled. In order for the derogation in Article 9 (2) (h) to apply, it is therefore necessary supplementary rules of Union or national law. In Swedish law has the possibility of processing sensitive personal data in the social services activities are regulated in § 7 (3) SoLPuL. It is clear from that provision that sensitive personal data may be processed on the basis of Article 9 (2) (h) the Data Protection Regulation if the information has been provided in a case or is necessary for the business and provided that the requirement of confidentiality in Article 9 (3) of the Data Protection Regulation is fulfilled. For the processing of sensitive personal data in accordance with Article 9 of the the regulation thus places even higher demands on the complementary national the regulation regarding precision and predictability for it to be applicable. Then the generally formulated national regulation can not be considered live up to the requirements of precision and predictability and thus constitute legal basis for the processing of non-sensitive personal data by camera surveillance, nor can it in a similar way in general drafted the national provision on the treatment of sensitive Page 13 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 1 3 (22) personal data is considered to live up to the requirements of precision and predictability. The provision in § 7 SoLPuL can thus not constitute such a supplement national law required for the derogation in Article 9 (2) (h) of the this Regulation shall apply to the processing of sensitive personal data through camera surveillance. In addition, section 7 of SoLPuL also requires that the information has been submitted in one case or are necessary for the business for the provision to be able to apply. Then the processing of personal data does not refer to a case but camera surveillance is an actual act, the information must be necessary for the activity may be that the treatment can be performed. However, since the necessity requirement cannot be considered fulfilled regarding the requirement of a legal basis for the processing of personal data, it may is also not considered to be fulfilled with regard to the exemption in Article 9 (2) (h) against the ban on the processing of sensitive personal data. The Data Inspectorate's assessment Even if the Social Affairs Committee had a legal basis under Article 6 (1) (i) the Data Protection Regulation, fulfills the processing of personal data by In summary, camera surveillance does not require one in Article 9 (2) applicable exemption from the ban on treating sensitive personal data. The Data Inspectorate thus assesses that Gnosjö municipality by camera-watching situations where the disease picture and health condition sensitive data has been processed in breach of Article 9 (1) and 9.2 of the Data Protection Regulation. Impact assessment and prior consultation (Articles 35 and 36) It follows from Article 35 of the Data Protection Regulation that a personal data controller in some cases must make an impact assessment regarding data protection, ie. before the processing of personal data make an assessment of a planned processing consequences for the protection of personal data. The obligation applies on a type of treatment, in particular with the use of new technologies and with taking into account its nature, scope, context and purpose, is likely to lead to a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Article 35 (7) sets out what an impact assessment should include. It will at least include a description of the planned treatment and the purposes of the treatment, an assessment of the need for and proportionality in the processing, an assessment of the risks to the data subjects' rights Page 14 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 1 4 (22) and freedoms as well as the measures planned to manage the risks and demonstrate that the Data Protection Regulation is complied with. An impact assessment can thus be described as a tool for identify risks with the processing of personal data and develop routines and measures to manage the risks, and thus assess the treatment is proportionate to its purpose. To implement one Impact assessment before starting treatment is thus often an important one action to assess whether a treatment is lawful. According to Article 36, the controller shall consult: The Data Inspectorate before the processing of an impact assessment regarding data protection under Article 35 shows that the processing would lead to a high risk unless the data controller takes measures to reduce the risk. The European Data Protection Board, EDPB 3 , has developed guidelines 4 regarding i what situations a treatment is likely to lead to a high risk of physical freedoms and rights of persons. The guidelines set out nine criteria to be considered in assessing whether a processing of personal data is likely to lead to a high risk for the data subject. If two of the criteria are met, it can personal data controller in most situations assume that a impact assessment should be performed, but also a treatment that only meets one of these criteria may in some cases require an impact assessment. Conversely, two or more of the criteria in the guide may be met but the data controller can still make the assessment that the processing probably does not lead to a high risk to the data subject's freedoms and rights. IN such situations, the controller should justify and document the reasons why an impact assessment is not carried out and include the views of the Data Protection Officer. The Data Inspectorate has, on the basis of guidelines from Article 29- the working group and the criteria developed by the group, a list of personal data processing covered by requirements for impact assessment regarding data protection (2019-01-16, dnr DI-2018-13200). The list complements and specifies Article 35 (1) and is intended to: 3 European Data Protection Board, formerly the Article 29 Working Party. 4 Guidelines on impact assessment regarding data protection and determining whether the treatment ""is likely to lead to a high risk"" within the meaning of the Regulation 2016/679, WP 248 rev. 01. Page 15 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 1 5 (22) further exemplify when the conditions in that provision can be considered be met. The list is not intended to be exhaustive when an impact assessment needs to be made. Criteria to be considered in the assessment of whether a planned treatment is likely to lead to a high risk is including whether the treatment concerns systematic monitoring of humans, sensitive data or data of a very personal nature, data on vulnerable persons or the use of new technologies or new organizational ones solutions. An impact assessment must be made of at least two of those on the list the listed points are included in the planned treatment. It is only mandatory to perform an impact assessment on the planned the treatment ”is likely to lead to a high risk to the rights of natural persons and freedoms ”. A treatment can meet two or more of the criteria but it personal data controller can still make the assessment that it is unlikely to leads to a high risk. In such situations, the person responsible for personal data should justify and document the reasons for an impact assessment not performed and include the views of the Data Protection Officer. In the end of The Data Inspectorate's list is also given examples of when at least two of the criteria must be considered to exist and thus when an impact assessment must be done. Examples are given when activities in social care uses camera surveillance in people's homes. The Social Affairs Committee has stated that they have not made any impact assessment because they do not save information from the camera surveillance. The Social Affairs Committee has also not submitted any request for prior consultation The Data Inspectorate. The Data Inspectorate's assessment The Data Inspectorate states that criteria that must be taken into account in the assessment of whether a treatment is likely to lead to a high risk is whether the treatment is intended systematic monitoring of people, sensitive data or data of very personal in nature, information on vulnerable persons or the application of new technology or organizational solutions. The Swedish Data Inspectorate's list shows that when activities within social care uses welfare technology, e.g. robots or camera surveillance, in people's housing, it is an example of treatment that requires one impact assessment is performed. Then the criteria are considered systematic Page 16 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 1 6 (22) monitoring, processing of sensitive personal data and use of new technology or new organizational solutions be met. According to the Data Inspectorate's assessment, the treatment in question has included a number of criteria suggest that the treatment is likely to lead to a high risk to the data subject's freedoms and rights. An explicit example in The Data Inspectorate's list of when impact assessment is required according to The Data Protection Regulation is when activities in social care, as in this cases, use camera surveillance in people's homes. Then the Social Affairs Committee does not has presented its assessment of not carrying out an impact assessment it has not shown that the treatment is unlikely to lead to a high risk, although several of the criteria in the guidelines are met. According to the Data Inspectorate assessment, the social committee has thus processed personal data in violation of Article 35 of the Data Protection Regulation. Based on what has emerged in the case, the Social Affairs Committee has not either submitted with a prior consultation. Because the Social Affairs Committee has not done any impact assessment, no assessment has been made of whether the processing entailed some risks to the data subject's freedoms and rights. Thus, the Social Affairs Committee has also not been able to show that the high risk that likely to have been lowered in such a way that there has been no reason to request prior consultation with the Data Inspectorate. According to the Data Inspectorate assessment, the social committee's processing of personal data thus also has in breach of Article 36 of the Data Protection Regulation. Information for registered Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation sets out the information to be provided provided if personal data is collected from the data subject, such as information on identity and contact details of the personal data responsible, the purposes of the processing for which the personal data is intended, the legal basis, the period during which the personal data will be stored as well as the data subject's rights. Article 12 of the Data Protection Regulation states that the data controller shall take appropriate measures to enable it registrants provide all the information referred to in Article 13, and that such information must be provided in a concise, clear, concise, comprehensible and easy available form and using clear and distinct language. The information must be provided in writing or in some other form. For reasons Page 17 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 1 7 (22) 58 of the Data Protection Regulation states that information must be concise, easily accessible and easy to understand and designed in clear and simple language and that, if necessary, visualization is used. The Social Affairs Committee has stated that they provided oral information to it residents, the resident's trustees and relatives. Also staff and visitors is said to have received information about the camera surveillance. Regarding the information provided to the resident, the Social Affairs Committee has stated that the resident has received information about the camera surveillance through that he was there watching when the camera was installed, and that the boss orally explained to the resident that the purpose of the camera is to the staff should know that the resident is feeling well. It has not emerged that in addition provided some other information about the camera surveillance to the resident. The Data Inspectorate states that the information provided by the Social Affairs Committee to the data subject (the resident) only includes information that camera surveillance is in progress, and not all the information it provides personal data controller is obliged to provide to the data subject at collection of personal data in accordance with Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation. The Social Affairs Committee has also stated that information has been provided to it trustee was registered. Chapter 11, Sections 4 and 7 of the Parental Code (1949: 381) state that the court may appoint a trustee for a person who, due to illness, mental disorder, impaired health or similar condition need assistance in guarding their rights, managing their property or caring for their person, and it is not enough that a good man be ordained or that the individual on any other less intrusive way gets help. The management assignment must be adapted to the needs of the individual in each particular case and may be limited to certain property or concern. The Data Inspectorate states that even when a trustee's assignment is designed in such a way that it includes the task of caring for the individual there are restrictions on what a trustee is allowed to do. Of the preparatory work for the provisions on trusteeship are set out below. In general, the principal should also be able to decide on matters himself concerning his accommodation as well as the content of the care offered. One trustees should therefore not normally represent the principal Page 18 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 1 8 (22) when it comes to issues of consent to, for example, surgical procedures. Of course, this does not prevent one from e.g. the side of care institutions obtains the administrator's views (Bill. 1987/88: 124 p 172). The Data Inspectorate has sent a request for supplementation on 15 June 2020 requested the Social Affairs Committee to provide documentation to the Data Inspectorate regarding the scope of the trustee assignment and the information provided the trustee. However, the Social Affairs Committee has not provided the information regarding the scope of the nominee assignment and has also not reported on what information has been provided to the trustee. The Social Affairs Committee has in addition nor reported its assessment that the trustee can represent it housing in respect of his right to information under Article 13 i the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate's assessment The Social Affairs Committee has not shown that there is an opportunity to provide information the trustee, instead of the person registered in the case in question, or that it information provided for in Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation has been provided. The Social Affairs Committee has thus not fulfilled its duty to provide information by inform the trustee. Nor does the information that the Social Affairs Committee has provided to the resident is sufficient for the duty to provide information to be fulfilled, the Social Affairs Committee's processing of personal data has also taken place in violation with Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation. Furthermore, it appears from section 15 of the Camera Surveillance Act (KBL) that information on camera surveillance must be provided through clear signage or on something else effective way. It also appears that provisions on the right to information about the personal data processing such as camera surveillance means are found in the Data Protection Ordinance and other regulations specified in section 6 KBL. The Social Affairs Committee has not provided information that there is any sign that informs that camera surveillance is being conducted. For the Social Affairs Committee to be considered have lived up to the requirements regarding information in the Camera Surveillance Act must thus, information about camera surveillance is considered to have been provided on something else effective way. Page 19 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 1 9 (22) As stated above, the information about the camera surveillance lives on The Social Affairs Committee states that it has not complied with the requirements for information according to the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate further assesses that nor did the Social Affairs Committee live up to the requirements to provide information on camera surveillance in another effective way. This means that the treatment of personal data also occurred in violation of the requirement for disclosure in § 15 KBL. Because the resident has not received the prescribed information according to the Data Protection Ordinance and also not according to the Camera Surveillance Act can the Social Affairs Committee is not considered to have complied with the transparency requirements of Article 5 (1) (a) the Data Protection Regulation. Choice of intervention Legal regulation If there has been a violation of the Data Protection Regulation The Data Inspectorate a number of corrective powers available under the article 58.2 a – ji of the Data Protection Regulation. The supervisory authority can, among other things instruct the data controller to ensure that the processing takes place in in accordance with the Regulation and if required in a specific way and within a specific period. It follows from Article 58 (2) of the Data Protection Ordinance that the Data Inspectorate in accordance with with Article 83 shall impose penalty fees in addition to or in place of others corrective measures referred to in Article 58 (2), as the case may be in each individual case. For the purposes of Article 83 (7) of the Data Protection Regulation, national authorities may: rules state that administrative sanctions may be imposed on authorities. According to ch. 6 Section 2 of the Data Protection Act allows for penalty fees to be decided authorities, but to a maximum of SEK 5,000,000 or SEK 10,000,000 depending on whether the infringement concerns articles covered by Article 83 (4) or 83.5 of the Data Protection Regulation. Section 25 (4) KBL also states that a penalty fee can be charged by the person who conducts camera surveillance and breaks against the disclosure requirement in section 15. Article 83 (2) sets out the factors to be taken into account in determining whether a administrative penalty fee shall be imposed, but also what shall affect the size of the penalty fee. Of central importance for the assessment of Page 20 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 2 0 (22) the seriousness of the infringement is its nature, severity and duration. About it in the case of a minor infringement, the supervisory authority may, in accordance with recital 148 i the Data Protection Regulation, issue a reprimand instead of imposing one penalty fee. Penalty fee The Data Inspectorate's inspection has shown that the Social Affairs Committee has considered personal data in violation of Articles 5, 6.1, 9.2, 13, 35 and 36 of the Data Protection Regulation. In addition, the Social Affairs Committee has violated section 15 KBL. In assessing whether the violations are so serious that an administrative sanction fee is to be imposed, the Data Inspectorate has taken into account that the personal data processing intended for camera surveillance of a resident in a very private sphere and in a position of dependence, where the treatment to some extent included sensitive personal data. The treatment has been ongoing from March 2019- April 2020, which is considered a relatively long time. Consideration has also been given to that the Data Inspectorate has become aware of the processing through a tip from a relative of the data subject. These circumstances are seen as aggravating. According to the Swedish Data Inspectorate's assessment, the processing did not involve one minor infringement without infringements that should lead to an administrative penalty fee. Then the articles in the Data Protection Ordinance that the Social Affairs Committee violated covered by Article 83 (5) of the Data Protection Regulation and concerns an infringement of the duty to provide information in section 15 KBL is the maximum amount for the sanction fee in this case SEK 10 million, according to ch. Section 2, second paragraph the law (2018: 218) with supplementary provisions to the EU data protection regulation. The administrative penalty fee shall be effective, proportionate and deterrent. This means that the amount must be determined so that it the administrative penalty fee leads to correction, that it provides a preventive effect and that it is also proportional in relation to both current violations as to the ability of the supervised entity to pay. In determining an amount that is efficient, proportionate and deterrent, the Data Inspectorate can state that the social committee has processed sensitive personal data about a resident in a situation that is very private and which means that housing is in a position of dependence Page 21 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-7782 2 1 (22) towards the municipality. The violation concerns the supervision of a person in his bedroom, which is a very privacy-infringing treatment. In addition, have the treatment lasted for a relatively long time, for more than a year. The Data Inspectorate has taken into account that housing has a serious self-harming behavior, sometimes with danger to life and health both for himself and the staff. The Social Affairs Committee has taken the measure to resolve a complex situation there personnel and housing have been at risk of injury. Although the situation has been difficult to handle, the Social Affairs Committee has not tried alternatives, less intervention measures to solve the problem of being able to have the resident under supervision in a smooth manner before the camera surveillance began. Given the seriousness of the infringements and that the administrative the penalty fee shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive The Data Inspectorate that the administrative penalty fee for the Social Affairs Committee shall be set at SEK 200,000.

The university has therefore processed personal data in contrary to Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) (i) Data Protection Regulation 1 by failing to take appropriate technical measures measures to ensure an appropriate level of safety in in relation to the risk. • has not reported the personal data incident to the Data Inspectorate and not documented the circumstances surrounding the incident then the university became aware of it. The university has therefore acted in breach of Article 33 (1) and (5) of the Data Protection Regulation. • in the processing of sensitive and privacy-sensitive personal data in the cloud service Box, during the period May 25, 2018 to spring 2019, no have taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to: prevent unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to personal data. The university has therefore treated personal data in breach of Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. Administrative penalty fee The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of Articles 58 (2) and 83 i the Data Protection Ordinance and Chapter 6 Section 2 of the Data Protection Act (2018: 218) to Umeå universities must pay an administrative sanction fee of SEK 550,000. 1 REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on that free flow of such data and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Regulation). Page 2 of 23 Page 3 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 3 (23) Report on the supervisory matter Background The Data Inspectorate began inspecting Umeå University on 29 August 2019. The inspectorate had received information that the university had sent sensitive personal information to the Police Authority via unencrypted e-mail. To the information was attached to the Police Authority's letter; Information about shortcomings in handling documents. The purpose of supervision is to investigate whether the personal data processing as described in the Police Authority's letter meets the requirements for security as set out in Articles 5 (1) (f) and 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate has also examined whether Umeå University has followed the provision of Article 33 of the Data Protection Regulation, which, inter alia is about the personal data controller's obligation to report to a personal data incident. Furthermore, the Data Inspectorate has investigated the handling of sensitive personal data in the cloud service Box made in accordance with data protection rules. The Data Inspectorate's supervision will take effect on 25 May 2018 the Data Protection Regulation came into force. The inspection therefore has not examined the incident that occurred before that date. The supervision has been carried out through written communication. What has emerged in the case Letter from the police authority The Police Authority's letter states, among other things, the following. A research group at Umeå University requested all of them preliminary investigation report concerning rape against men in Sweden from 2014. On 18 July 2016, the Police Authority released the documents by courier. Page 3 of 23 Page 4 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 4 (23) In connection with a request for supplementation via email attached research group, on 19 November 2017, unintentionally one of the preliminary investigation report previously issued by the Police Authority. Po- The regulatory authority then contacted the research group and pointed out the inappropriateness of to send sensitive material over unprotected email channels. The research group regretted what had happened and referred to the human factor. In connection with another request for supplementation attached the research group, on 5 February 2019, again the same preliminary investigation report. When the Police Authority contacted once again the research group on this was admitted that this time too it was unintentional attached the sensitive material in an email. Information from Umeå University Umeå University was responsible for personal data when the email was sent to The police authority. The principal researcher left his employment at Umeå University on 31 August 2018 for employment at Uppsala University. In that it The principal researcher changed employers and the workplace has the project also changed residence. However, this happened after the current events. The financier Forte 2 decided to change the principal on 13 March 2019 and The Ethics Review Authority approved the change, which involved a change research principal at Uppsala University on 10 May 2019. The research project at Umeå University has been approved by The ethics review authority and the preliminary investigation protocols have been received and stored on the basis of a public interest that allows personal data processing. The course of events In August 2016, the research group received the preliminary investigation protocols that requested. The documents were sent in paper form to Umeå University. All police reports and preliminary investigation protocols from 2014 scanned in and stored on a password-protected file surface. A physical version locked in an archive room. The preliminary investigation protocols contain information 2 Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare. Page 4 of 23 Page 5 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 5 (23) about, among other things, suspicion of crime, name, social security number and contact information. In addition, these protocols contain information on sexual life and health, ie sensitive personal data. In a request for supplementation made in 2017, the intention was not to attach the minutes to the other documents sent to The police authority. After what happened, the research group has, among other things, introduced a routine of scanning sensitive material separately. The research group has not been able to explain why the group, on 5 February 2019, once again attached the minutes in an email to the Police Authority. Security when sending the preliminary investigation protocols The incorrect handling has been limited to two occasions. Otherwise have project routines to lock in physical documents, to separate administrative documents from research data and to password protect digital documents followed. Only two researchers from the university have had access to the current case the material. The university has, among other things, regulations and instructions to ensure that the processing of personal data at universities complies with the requirements set out in Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. The university has had a clear since 2014 rule that sensitive personal data may not be sent by e-mail, in accordance with the document E-mail service at Umeå University. Employees get continuous training and information on the subject. The university is also planning to direct a special information effort on the processing of personal data in e-mail to all employees at the university. The university has made a mistake by sending sensitive personal information via e-mail to the Police Authority. The personal data processing in question can therefore not be said to meet those requirements imposed on appropriate security measures in accordance with Article 32 i the Data Protection Regulation. The personal data incident Umeå University became aware that sensitive personal data had been sent by e-mail in connection with the authority receiving the Data Inspectorate's letter of supervision, 30 August 2019. Page 5 of 23 Page 6 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 6 (23) On September 2, 2019, the university conducted an analysis of the events and then came to the conclusion that it was unlikely that the personal data incident would may pose a risk to data subjects. The university has documented the events in the Data Inspectorate's form for reporting personal data incident. The university has stated in the form, among other things following. The university has assessed that no report should be submitted to the Data Inspectorate. (…) The 2nd September, a registered letter was received from the Swedish Data Inspectorate containing information about the incidents. Umeå University's assessment is that it is unlikely that the incident resulted high risk to the freedoms and rights of individuals. There is no indication that anyone has occurred actual damage or that any unauthorized person had access to the information during the protocol in question sent to the authority that established it and to the administrator who had the task to handle and provide the university with the same type of information. Storage and access in the cloud service Box The university has scanned in 108 preliminary examination protocols from 2014 as saved locally on a personal computer and then uploaded to cloud service provider Box. The user can access the data stored in Box by logging in via a web interface internally via the university's network with single factor authentication (that is, username and password). It is also possible to log in externally via the internet on the university's website umu.se. The login then takes place via any equipment / network. The user states first their email address and then their college ID (username) and password. User accounts in Box are integrated and linked to university ID as in in turn are integrated with SWAMID. With SWAMID, a safe is obtained identification because passwords are neither saved nor sent to Box. The authentication takes place before, by sending a ""ticket"" to Box som confirms the authorization. All communication is encrypted with 256 bit SSL encryption (https). All information is stored with 256-bit encryption. This means that the information is not available if someone without authorization would have access Page 6 of 23 Page 7 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 7 (23) to it. Backups are also encrypted. Box stores the encryption keys separately from data. The research project includes two researchers and only the two have had access to and access to the file area provided by Box. Since access has been restricted, no special procedures have been established. The university has a personal data assistant agreement with SUNET (Swedish University computer Network) which, among other things, applies to storage of preliminary investigation protocols. SUNET has in turn hired the Deputy Assistant Box. Box stores the information in the United States and is connected to the Privacy Shield and has signed binding corporate regulations. The preliminary investigation protocols are covered by secrecy in accordance with ch. § 1 and 11 Cape. Section 3 of the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009: 400), OSL. Starting point is thus that confidentiality applies to the information. Information that sensitive personal data should not be stored in Box has published on the university's intranet in September 2016. The university has made the assessment that there are legal and safety conditions for storing both sensitive and confidential information in Box. However, the university has in connection with its risk and vulnerability analysis for precautionary reasons judged that this should not happen. The university has assessed that the file surface maintains a satisfactory level of safety. The assessment has been based on security measures such as access, access and authorization and security in communication. Justification of decision Applicable rules The responsibility of the personal data controller The Data Protection Regulation is the primary legal regulation in processing of personal data. Page 7 of 23 Page 8 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 8 (23) The person responsible for personal data is responsible for being able to show that they the basic principles of Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation are complied with (Article 5.2). The person responsible for personal data is responsible for implementing appropriate technical information and organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing is performed in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. The measures shall carried out taking into account the nature, scope, context of the treatment and purposes and the risks, of varying degrees of probability and severity, for freedoms and rights of natural persons. The measures must be reviewed and updated if necessary. This is stated in Article 24 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. Legal basis Article 6 of the Data Protection Regulation states the following. A treatment is only legal if one of the conditions specified in the article is fulfilled (paragraph 1). A treatment is legal if it is necessary to perform a task of public interest (paragraph 1 (e)). Research purposes are considered a task of public interest. The task of general interest must be established in accordance with Union law or national law (paragraph 3). For state universities and colleges are the research task established in ch. the Higher Education Act (1992: 1434). As a general rule, it is forbidden to process sensitive personal data, to for example, personal data on health and sexual life. However, there are a number derogation from the prohibition in Article 9 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation. Of Article 9 (2) j in the Data Protection Regulation it follows that the processing must be necessary for research purposes and shall be subject to appropriate safeguard measures for it rights and freedoms of data subjects in accordance with Article 89 (1) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. In addition, the exemption from this prohibition requires that national law contain provisions on appropriate and specific measures to ensure it registered privacy. One is established in the Ethics Review Act 3 3 The Act (2003: 460) on Ethical Review. Page 8 of 23 Page 9 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 9 (23) appropriate and specific action required in the treatment of sensitive personal data for research purposes. Also provisions on confidentiality in OSL is an example of such an appropriate and special measure. Article 89 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation sets out specific conditions for processing of personal data for research purposes. It states that the treatment shall be subject to appropriate protective measures in accordance with Regulation. The requirement for security in the processing of personal data A basic principle for the processing of personal data is the requirement security under Article 5 (1) (f) of the Data Protection Regulation, which states that: personal data shall be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unauthorized use treatment and against loss, destruction or damage by accident, using appropriate technical or organizational measures. It follows from Article 32 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation that the personal data controller and the personal data assistant shall take appropriate steps technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security which is appropriate in relation to the risk of the treatment. That too taking into account recent developments, implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment and the risks, of varying degrees of probability and severity, for the rights of natural persons and freedoms. When assessing the appropriate level of safety, special consideration shall be given to them risks posed by the treatment, in particular from unintentional or illegal destruction, loss or alteration or to unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data transferred, stored or otherwise treated. This is stated in Article 32 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation. Recital 75 of the Data Protection Regulation states that various factors must be taken into account in the assessment of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Among otherwise, personal data covered by the duty of confidentiality, data on health or sexual life. Furthermore, consideration must be given to whether the treatment applies personal data about vulnerable natural persons, in particular children, or about the processing involves a large number of personal data and applies to a large number of registered. Page 9 of 23 Page 10 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 1 0 (23) Recitals 39 and 83 also provide guidance on the more detailed meaning of the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation for security in the processing of personal data. If the personal data controller hires a personal data assistant to carry out a processing, the data controller shall only use personal data assistants who provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures. It should be done in such a way that the processing meets the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation and that it data subjects' rights are protected. It is clear from Article 28 (1) and recital 81 of the the Data Protection Regulation. These provisions also state how the relationship between the personal data controller and the personal data assistant shall be regulated. Obligation to report and document personal data incidents According to Article 4 (12) of the Data Protection Regulation, a personal data incident is a safety incident leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or change or to unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data transferred, stored or otherwise processed. According to Article 29 Group Guide WP250 4 may be unauthorized or illegal processing include the disclosure of personal data (or access to these) to recipients who are not authorized to receive (or access) the data, or any other form of processing that is contrary to the Data Protection Regulation. Article 33 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation states that the person responsible for personal data, in the event of a personal data incident, must report the incident to the supervisory authority without undue delay, and if so possible not later than 72 hours after learning of it. If it is it is unlikely that the personal data incident entails a risk to natural persons rights and freedoms need not be notified. About one personal data controller does not act quickly and it becomes obvious that a 4 Article 29 - Data Protection Working Party, WP250rev.01; Guidelines for notification of personal data incidents according to Regulation (EU) 2016/679; adopted on 3 October 2017; last reviewed and adopted on February 6, 2018; adopted by the European Data Protection Board, EDPB, during the first plenary session on 25 May 2018; pp. 11–12. The working group was set up pursuant to Article 29 of Directive 95/46 / EC and was an independent EU advisory body in matters concerning data protection and privacy. Page 10 of 23 Page 11 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 1 1 (23) incident has taken place, this can be considered a failure to act in in accordance with Article 33 5 . The following is stated in recital 85. A personal data incident that is not quickly remedied appropriately can for natural persons lead to physical, material or intangible damage, such as loss of control over one's own personal data or to limit their rights, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, unauthorized revocation of pseudonym, damage to reputation, loss of confidentiality in respect of personal data subject to professional secrecy, or to another economic or social detriment to the natural person concerned. As soon as one personal data controller becomes aware that a personal data incident has occurred, it should personal data controllers therefore report the personal data incident to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, if possible, within 72 hours of becoming aware of this, unless the data controller, in accordance with the principle of liability, can demonstrate that it is unlikely that the personal data incident will entail a risk of physical rights and freedoms of persons. According to the Article 29 Working Party, a data controller shall be deemed to have received knowledge of the incident when the data controller is reasonably certain that a security incident has taken place which has resulted in personal data endangered. The data controller shall, in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation, take all appropriate technical protective measures and all appropriate organizational measures to immediately determine whether a personal data incident has taken place room and promptly inform the supervisory authority and the data subjects. Recital 87 of the Data Protection Regulation states the importance of being able to establish one incident, assess the risk to individuals and then report the incident accordingly required. Article 33 (5) of the Data Protection Regulation regulates the obligation to: document personal data incidents. The person responsible for personal data shall document all personal data incidents, regardless of whether the incident should reported to the Data Inspectorate or not. The documentation must contain information about the circumstances surrounding the personal data incident, its effects and the corrective measures taken. The documentation must enable the supervisory authority to monitor compliance with Article 33 of the Data Protection Regulation. 5 WP250, rev01, p. 13. Page 11 of 23 Page 12 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 1 2 (23) The documentation obligation in Article 33 (5) is also linked to liability in Article 5 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation, ie the person responsible for personal data must be responsible for and be able to show that they the basic principles of data protection are complied with. There is also one link between Article 33 (5) and the provision on liability for data controller in accordance with Article 24 of the Data Protection Regulation. 6 It may be added that the Article 29 Working Party's guidelines state that it personal data controllers need to have routines to detect and remedy incidents involving personal data, which is the meaning of Article 33 (5). In addition, it shows the ability to quickly detect, remedy and report An incident should be seen as an important element of the appropriate technical and organizational measures referred to in Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. Transfer of personal data to third countries Chapter V of the Data Protection Regulation sets out the possibilities for: transfer personal data to a third country (a country outside the EEA). Personal data may be transferred if the European Commission has decided to do so there is an adequate level of protection in the recipient country or if there is one appropriate safeguards, for example through contractual clauses or binding company regulations. 7 For recitals 101 and 116 of the Data Protection Regulation, the risk is emphasized when personal data are transferred to countries outside the Union and the importance of: the level of protection does not decrease with such transfers. This is especially true in question of the protection of unauthorized use or unauthorized disclosure of this information. Furthermore, the person responsible for personal data and the personal data assistant's responsibility to ensure compliance with the Regulation. The Data Inspectorate's assessment Personal data responsibility The Data Inspectorate states that Umeå University is personal data controller for the processing of personal data that 6 WP250, rev01, p. 28. 7 See Articles 44 to 50 of the Data Protection Regulation. Page 12 of 23 Page 13 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 1 3 (23) updated in the case until the project was transferred to Uppsala university in the spring of 2019. Processing of personal data in unencrypted e-mail and open network The Data Inspectorate states that Umeå University, within the framework of research project, has sent a preliminary investigation report concerning rapes of men in an unencrypted e-mail via an open network to The police authority. Something that the university has also admitted. The preliminary examination report contains information on health and sexual life which are sensitive personal data. Processing of sensitive personal data can involve significant risks to personal integrity and are therefore required strong protection in the processing of such data. The preliminary investigation report also contains information on suspicion about crimes and social security numbers that are so-called privacy-sensitive personal data. The processing of this type of personal data is therefore off such that the data must have strong protection. That means if about these personal data sent by e-mail, they must be protected in such a way that unauthorized persons cannot take part in them. Personal data can, for example protected by encryption. Sending information with unencrypted e-mail means that even others than it the intended recipient can access the information in the e-mail. Thus it is not ensured that only the intended recipient takes part personal data. The university has also sent the personal data via an open network. One open network, such as the internet, is characterized by others being able to take part in it information communicated on the network. This means that unauthorized persons have been able to gain access to the personal data transferred by the university. As the person responsible for personal data, Umeå University must ensure that the technical and organizational measures ensure a level of security appropriate to: in relation to the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons which the treatment entails (Article 32 (1)). The personal data that is processed must for example, protected against unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access. What is the appropriate level of safety varies according to the risks, the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment. At Page 13 of 23 Page 14 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 1 4 (23) the assessment must therefore, for example, take into account what type it is personal data processed. 8 The university must identify the possible risks for those registered rights and freedoms and assess the likelihood of risks occurring and the consequences in such cases. In this case, it is a question of both sensitive and privacy-sensitive ones personal data. Processing this type of data requires a strong protection based on the nature of the treatment. All in all, the Data Inspectorate finds that Umeå University has processed personal data in violation of the Data Protection Ordinance by the University have not taken appropriate technical safety measures to protect the personal data in the e-mail based on the sensitivity of the data and how they were communicated unencrypted over open network. The treatment has therefore in breach of Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. The personal data incident should have been documented and reported According to Umeå University, the university became aware of being sensitive personal data sent via unencrypted e-mail by the university received the Data Inspectorate's supervisory letter on 30 August 2019. According to the university also documented the incident, on September 2, 2019, in The Data Inspectorate's form for reporting personal data incidents. As regards the knowledge of the incident, the Data Inspectorate states that it is off The police authority's letter dated 3 April 2019, states that The police authority in contact with the university pointed out the inappropriateness of that send sensitive personal information via unencrypted e-mail. The Data Inspectorate considers therefore that the university must have become aware of the current the incident before 30 August 2019 and at least no later than 3 April 2019. With regard to the documentation, the Data Inspectorate thus finds that the university did not document the circumstances surrounding the personal data incident immediately after becoming aware of it. This complicates the possibility of verifying compliance with Article 33 of the 8 See recitals 75 and 76 of the Data Protection Regulation. Page 14 of 23 Page 15 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 1 5 (23) the Data Protection Regulation. That the university has subsequently filled in The Data Inspectorate's form for reporting personal data incidents changes not the assessment that the university should have documented the incident already when the Police Authority contacted the university. Furthermore, the Swedish Data Inspectorate states that the university has not been admitted with a report of a personal data incident to the Swedish Data Inspectorate. According to the university was due to the fact that it was unlikely that the incident would entail a high risk for individuals' freedoms and rights. The Data Inspectorate wants emphasize that there is always a risk that unauthorized persons may take part in it personal data if it is sent unencrypted via an open network. As The Data Inspectorate previously stated that the mailing is both sensitive and privacy-sensitive personal data. The risk for the data subjects' freedom and rights are therefore high if this type of personal data is processed in one in such a way that they, for example, benefit from unauthorized persons. All in all, the Data Inspectorate finds that Umeå University has failed to act in accordance with Article 33 (1) and (5) of the Data Protection Regulation. Storage of sensitive personal data in a cloud service in third countries Umeå University has used the cloud service Box to store 108 preliminary investigation report on rape of men. A cloud service is an Internet-based IT service provided by an external party supplier. The service can include storage but also other functions, there these are wholly or to some extent outside the internal operations of the company IT environment 9 . In this case, the storage is outside the university's internal IT environment. Via the personal data assistant SUNET hires Umeå University Deputy Assistant Box. The Data Protection Regulation does not only require that it the data controller shall ensure appropriate security for personal data. The regulation also requires that it the person responsible for personal data ensures that the personal data assistant fulfills one security level when processing personal data for it on behalf of the data controller. 9 For further definitions see Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, 01037/12 / EN WP 196, Opinion 05/2012 on Cloud Computing. Page 15 of 23 Page 16 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 1 6 (23) The person responsible for personal data is also responsible for ensuring that the person who the personal data assistant in turn hires meets the requirements in the Data Protection Regulation. Box is supplied by a US company that stores the information in the US. According to the university, Box was connected to the Privacy Shield and had signed binding corporate rules. Personal data may be transferred to third countries only if the conditions in Chapter V of the Data Protection Regulation are complied with. This applies provided that it the personal data controller and the personal data assistant can ensure that it The level of protection afforded to natural persons by the Regulation is not undermined. According to a decision by the European Commission 10 , it has been allowed for personal data controllers in the EU to transfer personal data to recipients who has joined the Privacy Shield. In the so-called Schrems II case 11 of 16 July 2020, however The European Court of Justice that the Privacy Shield agreement between the EU and the US does not provide adequate protection of personal data when it is transferred to the United States. The means that EU data controllers are no longer allowed to: with the support of Privacy Shield transfer personal data to the United States. The Schrems II target may also affect transfers of personal data that takes place with the help of binding company regulations. The as the legislation of a third country may affect the protection afforded through these provisions. The European Court of Justice has ruled that it is personal data controller who must assess the level of protection required according to EU law is complied with in the third country concerned. The Data Inspectorate states that Umeå University ceased to process the current personal data in the cloud service Box in the spring of 2019. Then it was allowed by the European Commission decision to transfer personal data to the United States with the support of Privacy Shield. The Data Inspectorate therefore stays current 10 Implementing decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 under Directive 95/46 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on whether adequate protection is ensured through the EU and US Privacy Shield. 11 Case C-311/18 - Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland and Maximillian Scares. Page 16 of 23 Page 17 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 1 7 (23) case stating that Box is said to have been connected to the Privacy Shield at that time and that the treatment at the university had ended before The Schrems II goal. In addition to the personal data controller having support to transfer personal data to third countries, the person responsible for personal data is also responsible for the personal data assistant to process the data in a way that ensures adequate security. That personal data, like the personal data assistant, is in a third country may increase the risk that natural persons will not be able to exercise their data protection rights, in particular to protect against unauthorized use use or unauthorized disclosure of this information. 12 In this case, it is a matter of information that is protected by confidentiality. In order to be allowed to process sensitive personal data, the Data Protection Ordinance sets requirement that national law contain provisions on appropriate and special measures. The provisions on secrecy to protect it individuals is such regulation that protects the integrity of individuals in handling of public documents. 13 This means that confidentiality is one privacy protection measure such as the personal data controller and the personal data assistant has to follow. When the personal data is stored with a actor who is not covered by secrecy, this means weaker privacy protection for the information, as a statutory duty of confidentiality that is penal sanction provides stronger protection than an agreed duty of confidentiality. 14 Since Box is an actor that is not covered by OSL, the personal data receives one weaker privacy protection. There are also technical weaknesses in the selected storage. To gain access to the preliminary examination protocols in Box, the university has used a so-called single factor authentication. In this case, college ID (username and password. 12 Cf. recitals 101 and 116 of the Data Protection Regulation. 13 See the bill New Data Protection Act (Bill 2017/18: 105 p. 116). 14 JO's decision of 9 September 2014, no. 3032-2011. Page 17 of 23 Page 18 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 1 8 (23) The authentication is used so that the person responsible for personal data can see that only authorized users have access to personal data. Single factor authentication is a weak form of authentication. The risk of someone can get username and password is great. Besides, it is not surely the one who has been robbed will discover that this has happened if someone comes across username and password through for example so called phishing. Stronger authentication should make it harder for unauthorized people to get over them necessary login information needed to be able to authenticate. Stronger authentication can be achieved by using more than one factor (something you know, something you have and something you are). For example, can ""Something you know"" can be a username or password, ""something you have"" can be a smart card or mobile phone and ""something you are"" can be one fingerprints or facial features. The user can access the data stored in Box by logging in via a web interface internally via the university's network with single factor authentication (that is, username and password). The can also log in externally via the internet on the university's website umu.se. The login then takes place via optional equipment and optional network and the user first states his e-mail address and then his college ID (username) and password (that is, with single-factor authentication). Because access to the current data can be via the open network is the exposure area to unauthorized persons is very large, which entails the risk of the data will unauthorized to part increases. Umeå University has stated that the communication and storage of the information in the preliminary investigation protocols has been encrypted in Box. However, the Data Inspectorate does not consider that this means that the information is adequately protected against unauthorized access. For example, it may be illegal come across usernames and passwords pretending to be authorized and thus take part of the information in clear text. As previously stated, the person responsible for personal data must ensure a suitable one safety in relation to the risk of treatment. This also applies when Page 18 of 23 Page 19 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 1 9 (23) the personal data is processed by a personal data assistant. The personal data controllers must therefore make an assessment of the risks that may occur during treatment. When the personal data controller processes personal data in a cloud service, the person in charge needs to implement a suitability assessment that includes a risk analysis. That way, it gets personal data controller a basis for being able to make decisions about which appropriate technical and organizational measures that are needed or should be required by the personal data assistant. It also provides the person responsible for personal data an opportunity to ensure an appropriate level of security. When assessing the security level when storing and transferring personal data, special consideration shall be given to whether the processing entails a risk of unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access. Umeå University has stated that the university in connection with its risk and Vulnerability analysis assessed that sensitive personal data should not be stored in Box for precautionary reasons. This information was published at the university intranet in September 2016. Despite the university scanned in preliminary investigation protocols and stored them in Box. The preliminary investigation protocols concern rapes against men and personal data in them are both sensitive and privacy-sensitive. The information is covered in addition to confidentiality. The Data Inspectorate's assessment is that the processing of this type of personal data involves a high risk to the privacy of individuals if the personal data is disclosed or if an unauthorized person gains access to it. The treatment is therefore of such a nature that it requires a high level of safety. The Data Inspectorate states that it has been a question of a treatment of personal data in a cloud service in the United States that is not covered by the regulations in OSL, and that security has not been high enough to prevent unauthorized access to the data. In addition, the Data Inspectorate states that the university in 2016 assessed that the processing of sensitive personal data in Box was not appropriate. In summary, the Data Inspectorate finds that Umeå University does not have have taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the sensitive and privacy-sensitive personal data stored in Box. The university has thereby not ensuring a level of safety that is appropriate in relation to Page 19 of 23 Page 20 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 2 0 (23) the risk of processing the personal data in question in the case. Umeå University has thus processed the personal data in violation of Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) of the Data Protection Regulation. Choice of intervention Legal regulation In the event of violations of the Data Protection Ordinance, the Data Inspectorate has a number corrective powers, including reprimand, injunction and penalty fees. It follows from Article 58 (2) (a) to (j) of the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate shall impose penalty fees in addition to or instead of other corrective measures referred to in Article 58 (2), the circumstances of each individual case. Member States may lay down rules on whether and to what extent administrative penalty fees may be imposed on public authorities. This is stated in Article 83 (7) of the Regulation. Sweden has accordingly decided that the Data Inspectorate should be allowed to charge sanction fees by authorities. For infringements of, inter alia, Articles 32 and 33, the fee shall amount to a maximum of SEK 5,000,000. For infringements of, inter alia, Article 5 i According to the ordinance, the fee shall amount to a maximum of SEK 10,000,000. It appears from Chapter 6 Section 2 of the Data Protection Act and Article 83 (4) and (5) i the Data Protection Regulation. If a personal data controller or a personal data assistant, with respect to on one or the same or interconnected data processing, intentionally or through negligence violates several of the provisions of this Regulation the total amount of the administrative penalty fee may not exceed it amounts determined for the most serious infringement. It appears from Article 83 (3) of the Data Protection Regulation. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty fees in each individual case are effective, proportionate and deterrent. This is stated in Article 83 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. Article 83 (2) sets out the factors to be taken into account in determining whether a administrative penalty fee shall be imposed, but also what shall affect the size of the penalty fee. Page 20 of 23 Page 21 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 2 1 (23) The size of the penalty fee The university has sent a preliminary investigation protocol with personal data on, among other things, health, sexual life and suspicion of crime via unencrypted e-mail mail and through open network. The personal data processed is both sensitive and privacy sensitive and covered by regulations on secrecy. The police authority sent the information to the university via courier, which should made the university aware of the protection value of the data. Despite this failed the university to take appropriate technical safety measures. The personal data was thus not protected from the risk of being exposed to, among other things other unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access. The Data Inspectorate finds that no other assessment can be made than that the infringement took place through negligence. In addition, Umeå University has stored a large number, 108 pieces, preliminary investigation protocols with sensitive and privacy sensitive personal data in the cloud service Box. This without the university ensuring an appropriate level of security to be able to store this type of personal data in Box. The university thus also failed in this part to take appropriate technical safety measures. The university also did not ensure that personal data were covered by such appropriate organizational measures required by the data protection regulations. Contrary to its own risk and vulnerability analysis, the university stored them sensitive personal data in Box. The Data Inspectorate considers this to be one factor that must be taken into account when assessing the size of the penalty fee. Furthermore, the university has failed to report the personal data incident as occurred at the time of sending the e-mail to the Data Inspectorate. Nor the circumstances surrounding the incident were documented when the university became paid attention to it. Against this background, the Data Inspectorate finds that Umeå University through the current personal data processing has violated Article 5 (1) (f), Article 32.1 and 32.2 and Article 33.1 and 33.5 of the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate therefore considers that Umeå University should be imposed administrative penalty fees for the said infringements. Page 21 of 23 Page 22 The Data Inspectorate DI-2019-9432 2 2 (23) The Data Inspectorate finds that the treatments via e-mail and storage in Box refers to two interconnected data processing operations under Article 83 (3) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. This is because the treatments are the same personal data within a research project and refers to a violation of the same provisions, ie Article 5 (1) (f) and 32 (1) and (2) of the Regulation. When determining the size of the penalty fee, the Data Inspectorate takes into account the above circumstances and that the administrative penalty fee shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. That Umeå University does not have met the security requirements is serious when it comes to personal data of such a type that the data require strong protection based on the processing species. The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of an overall assessment that Umeå universities must pay an administrative sanction fee of a total of 550,000 kronor. For the mailing in the e-mail and the storage in the cloud service Box the university must pay a fee of SEK 450,000. For the university failure to report the personal data incident to the Data Inspectorate and for not having documented the incident, the university must pay a fee of SEK 100,000. This decision was made by Director General Lena Lindgren Schelin after presentation by lawyer Linda Hamidi. In handling the case has lawyer Caroline Cruz Julander participated. At the final processing have the unit managers Katarina Tullstedt and Malin Blixt and IT security specialists Johan Ma and Ulrika Sundling participated.

This by publishing sensitive personal data on Region Örebro County's website without being compatible with the principles of purpose limitation and data minimization, without there was a legal basis for it and in violation of the ban on treatment sensitive personal data. The Board of Health in the Region of Örebro County has also processed personal data in violation of the same publication Article 87 of the Data Protection Regulation and Chapter 3. § 10 layer (2018: 218) with supplementary provisions to the EU Data Protection Regulation (data protection law) by having processed social security numbers without having support for it. The Data Inspectorate finds that the Health Board in the Region Örebro County was examined at the February 2020 review personal data in violation of Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation by: not having taken sufficient organizational measures to ensure that personal data is protected from unauthorized publication on the region's website, such as establishing written instructions and ensuring that the person who publishes personal information on the site does so in accordance with instructions. The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of Articles 58 (2) and 83 (i) the Data Protection Regulation and Chapter 6. Section 2 of the Data Protection Act that Health and the Medical Board of the Region of Örebro County for the violations of Article 5, Articles 9 and 32 of the Data Protection Regulation and Chapter 3. § 10 the Data Protection Act must pay an administrative penalty of 120,000 crowns. Of this amount, SEK 80,000 refers to the violations of Articles 5, 6 and 9 and chap. Section 10 of the Data Protection Regulation and SEK 40,000 apply infringement of Article 32. The Data Inspectorate submits on the basis of Article 58 (2) (d) the data protection regulation The Health and Medical Board of the Örebro County Region to prepare written instructions and to introduce procedures to ensure that the person who publishes personal data on open websites does this in according to the instructions. An account of the supervisory matter The Data Inspectorate received a complaint against the Health and Medical Board i Region Örebro county regarding a notification to JO against forensic psychiatry the clinic in Örebro had been published in its entirety on the region's open website. The publication had taken place before a committee meeting on 25 September 2019. The notification contained the notifier's identity information (including personal identification number), contact details, information that the notifier was posted on the forensic psychiatric clinic and information that the notifier was the subject of urine sampling. As a result, the Data Inspectorate decided at the end of January 2020 to initiate an oversight of the Health and Medical Board i Region Örebro county with the purpose of investigating the board's handling of personal data in web publishing. In connection with the commencement of supervision and the Data Inspectorate alerted the committee if the publication took place the board removed the publication that the complaint concerned. The Board of Health in the Region of Örebro County has mainly stated following. The published document was immediately removed from the open site. Furthermore, all published summons and minutes were reviewed for the purpose of check that no additional grubbing had occurred. Then one was made personal incident report to the Data Inspectorate, an internal one the deviation notification was established and what could be done for it was investigated that something like that would never happen again. Region Örebro County normally publishes personal data in summons and protocols on their website that refer to elected politicians or service personnel in their service / trust assignments. For web publishing the Region of Örebro County is deemed to be able to invoke public interest in publishing protocols and summonses, including personal data, on the basis of Article 6 (i) the Data Protection Regulation and Chapter 2. Section 2 of the Data Protection Act. Sensitive personal data in accordance with Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation and Chapter 3. § 3 the Data Protection Act should never be published on the region's website. In the present the case should not have been published. The Board of Health does not have written procedures regarding publication of documents and personal data on the website. There are a few people which has the task of publishing the Health Board calls and minutes on the website. Routines around publishing are served orally. In this case, the oral procedures have not been followed and the action was published by mistake. The Örebro County Region has begun work on creating written guidelines and routines for serving summonses and minutes to elected representatives and for publishing on the site. Other information that has emerged in the case The Data Inspectorate has gone through the information provided by the Board about the incident in a personal data report (no. PUI-2020-339). Board states in this document, inter alia, that the incident occurred due to ""Human factor: failure in the individual case"" (a suppressed response option), that the action has been removed from the external web, the removal of the document was accompanied by an immediate review of all published calls and protocols to ensure that no disclosure has occurred otherwise or in other documents, that a date is set for information and a review of the relevant staff group regarding rules for publication on the web, and that the data subject was informed about the incident. In an annex to the notification of personal data incident, the region wrote the following. “The region of Örebro County considers it very important to personal data are handled correctly and in accordance with the rules in force at any given time. Therefore, Region Örebro County strives to be in the various stages of preparation of cases, pay attention to the existence of personal data in different types of documents, and that if it is not necessary that they be there, either take remove them or present them in such a way that they cannot be derived separate individual. This work is done systematically and through a number preparation steps./…/ In the present case, however, they have been current information as a result of an error, which is not in the usual way noted in the preparation process, has followed in the publication on the public web. "" Justification of decision The Data Inspectorate finds that among the personal data that was published on Region Örebro County's open website there were information that been sensitive in accordance with Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation. This is the case for the information that the data subject is admitted to the forensic psychiatrist clinic and that they are subject to urine sampling. This then it the former task reveals that the person can suffer from a serious mental illness disorder and the latter statement that the person has or has had one drug problems. Thus, they constitute data on health. Furthermore, the social security number covered by the publication. Legal regulation Personal data may only be processed if there is a legal basis for it as stated in Article 6 of the Data Protection Regulation. Such legal support may for example consist of the treatment necessary to perform one task of general interest, such as giving the public access to it municipal operations. Processing of sensitive personal data is like generally prohibited and such personal data may only be processed if processing is subject to an exception in Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation. Social security numbers may only be processed with the support of Chapter 3. § 10 the Data Protection Act, that is, if it exists (one according to the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation valid) consent or if the treatment is clearly justified for the purpose of the treatment, the importance of a secure identification or any other consideration reason. Those who process personal data must, in addition to having a legal basis always comply with the basic principles set out in Article 5 (i) data protection regulation. Among other things, personal data may only be used for specific, explicit and justifiable purposes (the principle of purpose restriction) and no more personal data may be processed than necessary for the purposes (data minimization principle). Of Article 32 It follows that the data controller has to take appropriate technical and organizational measures for personal data to secure one level of security appropriate to the risk to natural persons rights and freedoms. Furthermore, the data controller shall, according to Article 32 (4), take steps to ensure that every natural person performing work under the supervision of the data controller, and who receives access to personal data, only processes these on instruction from it personal data. Assessment of the publication by the Data Inspectorate The data inspection assesses the publication of a private person correspondence to an authority went beyond a conceivable purpose of: publish parts of the current case on the web (to give the public access to municipal activities). Thus, there was nothing special, explicitly stated and justified with the publication of the relevant ones personal data. Furthermore, there has been no legal basis for that publish personal data and the publication has not been covered by anything exceptions to the prohibition on processing sensitive personal data. Social security numbers have been published without the conditions stated in Chapter 3. § 10 the data protection law has been complied with. The Board of Health has only worked with oral instructions to the employees responsible for publishing the committee's actions on the web. The publication should have been preceded by an assessment of if permitted by the Data Protection Regulation. That this has not happened indicates that the board failed in the instructions to those working under the board supervision. This means that the board has not taken appropriate steps organizational security measures to protect against unauthorized publishing of personal information on the web. The Data Inspectorate has in a number of decisions about municipalities' web publications according to the Personal Data Act 1 stated that an appropriate organizational measure for Protecting personal data from unauthorized publication is a written procedure for Web Publishing. Such routines should be used by staff and should determine when personal data may be published, who should do it 1 The Personal Data Act (1998: 204), PuL, came into force on 24 October 1998 and ceased to valid on May 24, 2018. The Data Inspectorate was a supervisory authority according to PuL until that The Data Protection Regulation began to apply on 25 May 2018. the assessment, how long the data will be kept on the web, work routine for masking of sensitive or confidential information, handling of linked documents and stating who is responsible for publishing and possible deletion of data. 2 Other suitable measures may be to be seen to ensure that staff receive adequate training in the Data Protection Regulation and how it should work so that personal data is not handled in violation of the regulations. Such training can ensure that the person publishing personal data on the website does this in accordance with the instructions provided by it personal data. The routines that the Board of Health has had are not enough to protect personal data from publication in violation of the Data Protection Regulation. Sufficient measures have not been taken to ensure that those who publishes personal data under the supervision of the board, doing so in accordance with the committee's instructions for publication. The Data Inspectorate therefore finds that the Board of Health i The Örebro County Region has violated Articles 5, 6, 9 and 32 i the Data Protection Regulation, and Chapter 3. Section 10 of the Data Protection Act. Choice of intervention The Data Inspectorate has found that the Board has published sensitive data personal information and social security numbers on Region Örebro County's website and that the Board lacks written procedures for web publishing. The publication which has occurred has no legitimate purpose and legal basis. The publication has not been covered by any of the exceptions to the ban on treatment sensitive personal data. This means that the board has dealt with it personal data contrary to the principles of purpose limitation and data minimization in Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation; legal treatment in Article 6 and the prohibition on the treatment of sensitive personal data in Article 9. The publication of social security numbers is not sufficient the terms of Chapter 3. § 10 of the Data Protection Act and therefore contravenes it provision. Article 58 of the Data Protection Regulation lists all the Data Inspection Authority powers. The data inspection has in case of violations of 2 See, for example, DI-1309-2011, DI-1787-2011 and DI-1057-2016. the Data Protection Regulation a number of corrective powers to be granted under Article 58 (2) (a) to (j), including reprimand, injunction and penalty fees. It follows from Article 58 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation that the Data Inspectorate i in accordance with Article 83 shall impose penalties in addition to or instead of other corrective measures referred to in Article 58 (2), depending on: the circumstances of each case. If it is a minor infringement shall be given to the supervisory authority, according to recital 148 (i) the Data Protection Regulation, issue a reprimand instead of imposing one penalty. Penalty fee shall be paid The Data Inspectorate has determined that the Board has violated Articles 5, 6, 9 and 32 of the Data Protection Regulation and 3 chap. Section 10 of the Data Protection Act, adopted on the basis of Article 87 of the Data Protection Regulation. These articles are covered of Articles 83 (4) and 83 (5). In case of an infringement of these shall the supervisory authority consider imposing administrative penalties in addition to, or instead of, other corrective actions. The Data Inspectorate considers that this is not a minor infringement. This is in light of the fact that the personal data that was published were sensitive and touched a patient. Furthermore, the person could not reasonably expect that his correspondence was made available to a large circle. In addition, was the personal data was published for a long time without being discovered Board. There is no reason to replace the penalty charge with anyone else Corrective Action. The Board of Health should thus be applied to one administrative penalty charge. Determination of the amount of the penalty amount According to Article 83 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative penalties in each individual cases are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. For authorities, according to Chapter 6. Section 2, second paragraph of the Data Protection Act that the penalty fee shall be set at a maximum of SEK 5,000,000 at infringements referred to in Article 83 (4) of the Data Protection Regulation and at most SEK 10,000,000 for violations referred to in Article 83 (5). Violations of Articles 5, 6, 9 and 3 Chap. Section 10 of the Data Protection Act (adopted on the basis of Article 87) is subject to the higher penalties provided for in Article 83 (5) and violations of Article 32 are covered by the lower maximum amount according to Article 83.4. Article 83 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation specifies factors to be taken into account determining the amount of the penalty charge. These factors include: the nature, severity and duration of the infringement; (b) the infringement (c) the measures taken by it the personal data controller has taken to alleviate the damage they have (d) the degree of responsibility of the data controller with having regard to the technical measures implemented in accordance with Article 32, (g) the categories of personal data covered by the infringement; ways in which the breach came to the attention of the regulator, in particular whether and to what extent the data controller reported infringement. The Data Inspectorate's assessment of the size of the penalty fee has regard taken to the following. The violation has involved sensitive personal data concerning a person in dependency position for which the publication of the information may have been obtained serious consequences. Furthermore, the information has been published openly the region's website for a long time. The lack of appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure such personal data does not Being published poses a risk that similar events will occur again. The lack of appropriate security measures is reflected in the fact that the Board does not himself discovered the incorrect publication. However, the publication does not has been done deliberately and there is nothing to suggest that more than one person in the reality would have been affected by erroneous publications of sensitive personal data. In addition, the Board will as soon as it becomes aware if the event acted by removing the published action, inform the registered and inform the personnel concerned and that work has begun on developing written routines. Data inspection Board also notes that the region has made a personal incident report on behalf of the Board to the Data Inspectorate and followed the regulations which is in that respect. The publication of personal data on the board's open website concerns one and the same action and includes violation of Articles 5, 6 and 9 i the Data Protection Regulation and Chapter 3. Section 10 of the Data Protection Act. The penalty charge for the violation of Article 32 relates to that of the Board organizational security measures when publishing on open websites and is thus determined separately. The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of an overall assessment that Health and the Medical Board of the Örebro County Region shall pay an administrative fee penalty fee of SEK 120,000 for the violations of Articles 5, 6, 9 and 32 of the Data Protection Regulation and 3 chap. Section 10 of the Data Protection Act. Of this the amount refers to SEK 80,000 violations of Articles 5, 6 and 9 i the Data Protection Regulation and Chapter 3. Section 10 of the Data Protection Act and 40,000 SEK refers to the violation of Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. Order for additional organizational measures According to Article 58 (2) (d), the Data Inspectorate has the power to submit one person responsible for personal data to ensure that a processing is carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation. Article 58 (2) states that administrative penalty fees can be combined with injunctions. The Health Board has not taken sufficient organizational measures measures under Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation to ensure that: personal data is protected from unauthorized publication on the region's website, such as establishing written instructions and ensuring that the person who publishes personal information on the site does so in accordance with instructions. The Health Committee in Region Örebro County should therefore be submitted to Establish written instructions and put in place procedures to ensure it publishing personal information on open websites does this in accordance with the instructions. This decision has been taken by Director General Lena Lindgren Schelin after presentation by \[lawyer\] Elin Hallström. At the final processing also has Chief Counsel Hans-Olof Lindblom, Head of Unit Malin Blixt and Head of Unit Katarina Tullstedt participated. IT security specialist Magnus Bergström has participated in the assessments relating to information security."

The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of Articles 58 (2) and 83 the Data Protection Ordinance for violation of Article 6 (1) f) that Uppsalahem AB shall pay an administrative sanction fee of SEK 300,000. Report on the supervisory matter On 9 March 2020, the Data Inspectorate received a complaint about camera surveillance in an apartment building. The complaint alleges that Uppsalahem AB conducts camera surveillance in an apartment building with one camera mounted in such a way that it films straight towards the complainant's apartment door. The Data Inspectorate has initiated supervision against Uppsalahem AB for the purpose to investigate the scope of the surveillance and whether it personal data processing that monitoring entails (hereinafter ""Surveillance"") has legal support under Article 6 of the Data Protection Regulation. Uppsalahem AB (hereinafter ""the company"") has mainly stated the following. The company is responsible for personal data for monitoring. The camera has been mounted in the residential building in the manner claimed in the complaint and filmed the floor where the appellant lives. In the shooting area of the camera, two are visible apartment doors clearly in the picture, one of which belongs to the complainant and the other belongs to a resident of the house who has been subjected to disturbances and harassment. The complainant's door is filmed from the side and the other door is filmed from the front. If the complainant opens his apartment door, a narrow angle of the hall is filmed in the apartment. If the other tenant opens his apartment door is filmed the hall in the apartment.

Access to the material is restricted to five executives within the company - one lawyer, one trustee, two housing supporter and a housing consultant - and the material is stored only locally in the camera. Housing coordinator, housing consultant and manager need access to the material in their work of handling disturbance cases. A lawyer needs access to the material in cases where a legal assessment needs to be made and whether materials need to be used as evidence in disputes. To be able to take part in the material, you must load download the media in place from the camera to an external device. Meanwhile then the surveillance was ongoing, no access to the material has actually taken place, and material has also not been shared with any external actor. The purpose of the surveillance is to deal with the disturbances which has been going on in the stairwell for a long time, but which escalated in the beginning of 2019. It has been about potentially criminal behavior in the form of vandalism and harassment as well as other types of disruptive behavior that do not are necessarily criminal. The appellant has been singled out by other residents as the one who is responsible for the problems. The camera has been aimed at one apartment door belonging to a resident who has been particularly exposed to harassment in order to identify the perpetrator when he is at the door. The company supports its monitoring on the legal basis of balancing interests pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) of the Data Protection Regulation. In its balance of interests has the company weighed its own interest in conducting surveillance against the individuals interest in the protection of privacy. The company has stated that the following circumstances have mainly been taken into account in a strengthening direction for their guarding interest.  The landlord's obligation according to the Land Code, ch. 12 to take action to cause disturbances in the rental property to cease and tenants the right to compensation if the landlord does not take such measures,  the existing problems and the incidents that have occurred the place,  the importance of identifying the perpetrator or perpetrators,  the potentially deterrent effect that surveillance could have future incidents and the Swedish Data Inspectorate DI-2020-4534 4 (12)  the security-creating function the surveillance could have for them residents who have been subjected to harassment and vandalism. The company has stated that it has weighed its interest in surveillance against them individuals' interest in not being monitored on site. The company has at the same time stated that it has been assessed that the invasion of privacy that the surveillance entails has been limited by the following measures taken in connection with the surveillance.  The fact that staff at Uppsalahem do not have direct access to recorded material as well  that access to material should only take place when there are strong reasons. With this in mind, the company considers that the interest in surveillance outweighs than the interest of privacy and that the surveillance is thus permitted according to article 6.1 f the Data Protection Regulation. Justification of decision What is covered by the Data Inspectorate's examination of the case? The Data Protection Regulation contains a large number of rules that must be followed processing of personal data, including those through camera surveillance. Within the framework of this supervisory matter deals The Data Inspectorate does not have all the rules and issues that can updated in such a personal data processing as the current one the surveillance entails. The examination is limited to the question of whether the company has supported the treatment in any of the legal bases set out in Article 6 of the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate thus does not take position on whether the company has followed or not followed any others the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation in the context of this case, such as for example, the provisions on the rights of data subjects under the Articles 12-22 Data Protection Ordinance. Supervision does not cover either the provisions of the Camera Surveillance Act (2018: 1200), for example if duty of permission, duty of disclosure or duty of confidentiality. Data Inspectorate DI-2020-4534 5 (12) The Data Inspectorate's assessment Article 6 (1) (f) - balancing of interests The company has stated that the current monitoring is supported by Article 6 (1) f) the Data Protection Regulation. There are three conditions that must be met 2 fulfilled for that to be the case. The first condition is that they interests that the guardian intends to protect must be justified interests. The second condition is that the surveillance is necessary to protect the current interest or interests. The third condition is that the data subject's fundamental freedoms and rights do not outweigh the legitimate interest that the surveillance intends to protect. These props should therefore be tried separately in the context of this case. Is the company's security interest justified? The first part of the assessment concerns the nature of the interests the surveillance should protect. Not all conceivable interests could achieved or protected by camera surveillance may be considered justified. A legitimate interest is an interest that, in general, is enjoyed protection of the legal system or is otherwise considered legitimate, ethical or defensible. An interest protected by EU law or relevant national right must, for example, be regarded as justified. The Data Inspectorate must therefore take a position on whether the company's security interest can be considered justified in this case. The purpose of the surveillance in this case has been to come to fruition with the disturbances that have occurred in the property during a longer time. The disturbances have largely consisted of potentially criminal ones attacks on residents' freedom, peace, health or property. The interest of that prevent, prevent or detect crime is normally considered to be one 3 legitimate interest. The European Court of Justice has further ruled in case C-708/18 that a tenant-owner association has a legitimate interest according to the elderly data protection legislation to protect tenants' property, health and life. There is no reason to assume that the entry into force of The Data Protection Regulation has led to a change in the legal situation in that area. It may further be assumed that a landlord has the same interest in relation to their tenants that a tenant-owner association has in relation to theirs Judgment of the European Court of Justice in Case C-13/16 Riga's Satikism paragraph 28. Judgment of the European Court of Justice in Case C-708/18 TK paragraph 42. Data Inspectorate DI-2020-4534 6 (12) members. The Data Inspectorate therefore assesses that the company's interest in conducting on-site surveillance has been a legitimate interest. Is surveillance necessary to safeguard the interest in surveillance? Furthermore, surveillance must be necessary to protect the mentioned interests. In this assessment, the Data Inspectorate must check that it is justified the interest that has emerged in the case cannot reasonably be protected on an equal footing effectively by other means which to a lesser extent interfere with the fundamental freedoms and rights were registered, in particular the right to protection for privacy and the right to the protection of personal data under Articles 7 and 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The condition that the processing of personal data must be necessary shall be further tested together with the principle of data minimization, as set out in Article 5 (1) (c) of the Data Protection Regulation. 4 It appears from the investigation in the case that the company has taken alternative and less privacy-sensitive measures for camera surveillance before the camera assembled. However, these measures have not had the intended effect. Then the camera installed, the disturbances in the stairwell ceased in principle completely and the direction. This suggests that the surveillance was necessary to protect the company and the legitimate interests of tenants. It must also be taken into account in the examination of whether the monitoring was necessary or not if the camera has been used in a way that limits its intrusion the privacy that surveillance entails without compromising that matter would jeopardize the effectiveness of surveillance. In the present case, the invasion of privacy is limited by the measures that the company has taken applies to access to the recorded material. The company has also chosen to operate surveillance only with a camera and at the place where it was judged that the surveillance had the potential to give the greatest effect, which is compatible with the principle of data minimization. At the same time, it could have been minimized further data collection by masking parts of the camera catchment area, especially the apartment doors that are clearly visible in the picture. MAN had also for the same reason been able to consider mounting the camera so that you filmed from a different angle or in some other way adjust the camera catchment area. This would have made it possible to avoid filming in 3 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2010 / C 83/02). 4 C-708/18 TC points 47-48. 5 C-708/18 TK, item 50.Datainspektionen DI-2020-4534 7 (12) the dwellings on the ground floor, which has most likely happened below the time the camera was in operation. Taking into account the alternative measures that the company has taken before the camera was mounted without effect, the Data Inspectorate assesses, however overall that the monitoring was necessary to take advantage of the company's and the legitimate interests of the residents. Do the interests of the data subjects outweigh the interests of the security guards? Initially, it can be stated that camera surveillance by definition entails a restriction of the right to protection of personal data, which guaranteed by Article 8 of the Statute of Rights. Because the coverage in this the case has been conducted in close proximity to individuals' private homes, it has also entailed a restriction of the right to respect for private and family life and own housing guaranteed by Article 7 of the the Charter of Rights. Because the surveillance has taken place on the property's first floor level, all residents in the house have been subject to surveillance on the way to and from his home throughout the period the camera was on. This applies especially for the complainant and the accommodation in the apartment next to the complainant, because their apartment doors are so clearly included in the camera's recording area. It should also be taken into account that case law regarding the monitoring of common spaces in apartment buildings have been restrictive. It has been described, for example that security of entrances to apartment buildings - where the interest in privacy can assumed to be slightly lower than in the present case - can be accepted only in pure 6 exceptional cases. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has further stated that the data subject should not reasonably expect to be subject to surveillance 7 on private land or in living environments. These circumstances mean that the interest in privacy at the site as a starting point weighs very heavily. However, the interest in privacy is weakened somewhat by the fact that security partly aimed at protecting the persons who have been the subject of surveillance and by the fact that staff at the company did not have direct access to the recorded material. In this context, the Data Inspectorate would like to remind that it arrives at it during all personal data processing personal data controller to implement routines that involve access 6 See the Data Inspectorate's decision of 21 June 2011 in case no. 1745-2010. 7 EDPB Guidelines 3/2019 on processing of personal data through video devices, p. 13Datainspektionen DI-2020-4534 8 (12) to personal data only takes place when there are reasons for it. That the company in the present case has had such a routine in place therefore does not affect the interest in integrity in either a strengthening or weakening direction. By a overall assessment, the Data Inspectorate considers that the integrity interest in the place weighs very heavily. With regard to the interest in surveillance, the Data Inspectorate finds no reason to make any other assessment of the circumstances to be weighed than what the company has done. In light of these, the Data Inspectorate assesses that the interest in surveillance at the site weighs relatively heavily. The company has thus had a significant security interest, but with consideration to the very weighty interest in privacy, the Data Inspectorate assesses that the interest in privacy outweighs. The Data Inspectorate therefore finds that Uppsalahem AB has violated Article 6 of the Data Protection Ordinance by: one has conducted camera surveillance to protect an interest that does not weigh more important than the interests of the data subjects and fundamental freedoms and rights on the spot. Choice of intervention Article 58 of the Data Protection Regulation lists all the powers that: The Data Inspectorate has. According to Article 58 (2), the Data Inspectorate has a number corrective powers, including warnings, reprimands or limitations of treatment. According to Article 58 (2) (i) of the Data Protection Regulation, the supervisory authority shall impose administrative penalty fees in accordance with with Article 83. Pursuant to Article 83 (2), administrative penalty fees, depending on the circumstances of the individual case, is applied in addition to or in instead of the measures referred to in Article 58 (2) (a) to (h) and (j) Article 83 (2) (n) the factors to be taken into account in administrative decisions penalty fees in general shall be imposed and in determining the size of the fee. Instead of penalty fees, in certain cases according to recital 148 to data protection regulation a reprimand is issued instead of penalty fees if it is a matter of a minor infringement. In the assessment, the Data Inspectorate DI-2020-4534 9 (12) circumstances such as the nature, severity and duration. Penalty fee The Data Inspectorate has above assessed that the company through its camera surveillance of a floor in an apartment building, including apartment doors and parts of housing, has violated Article 6 (1) (f) of the Data Protection Regulation. In view of the processing of personal data by this supervision includes has involved illegal camera surveillance concerning private individuals in its home environment, it is not a question of a minor violation. The Data Inspectorate wants in this context emphasize that the surveillance of residents' apartment doors and parts of their homes have formed a particularly sensitive part of privacy surveillance and that there is no reason to compensate for this the penalty fee with a reprimand. As the surveillance has ceased, it is not relevant to ban it in the future the surveillance. For the same reason, it is also not relevant to impose the company to limit the processing in a way that would make it legal. There is thus no other corrective measure than penalty fees current for the treatment that has taken place. The company must therefore be imposed on one administrative penalty fee. Determination of penalty fee According to Article 83 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, each supervisory authority shall: ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty fees in each individual cases are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The administrative the penalty fee may not, in accordance with Article 83 (3), exceed its amount most serious violation if it is a question of one or the same data processing or interconnected data processing. Article 83 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation sets out all the factors that must: taken into account when determining the size of the penalty fee. In the assessment the size of the penalty fee shall take into account, inter alia, Article 83 (2) a (nature, severity and duration of the infringement), b (intent or negligence), g (categories of personal data), h (how the infringement came about The Data Inspectorate's knowledge) and k (other aggravating or mitigating factor such as direct or indirect financial gain) Data Protection Ordinance.Data Inspectorate DI-2020-4534 1 0 (12) Pursuant to Article 83 (5) (a) of the Data Protection Regulation, in the event of infringements of the basic principles of treatment, including the conditions for consent, according to articles 5, 6, 7 and 9, administrative penalty fees are imposed on up to EUR 20 000 000 (twenty million) or, in the case of companies, up to 4 % of total global annual turnover for the previous financial year, depending on which value is highest. According to the company's annual report for In 2019, the company had sales of approximately 1,450,000,000 (one billion four hundred and fifty million) during that financial year. 4% of that amount is 58,000,000 (fifty-eight million) kronor. Because this amount is less than 20,000,000 EUR, the penalty fee shall be set at an amount between 0 and EUR 20 000 000. The penalty fees must in each individual case be effective, proportionate and deterrent. In the Data Inspectorate's assessment of the infringement character, the following factors have been taken into account in an aggravating direction.  The violation has come to the Data Inspectorate's knowledge through a complaint from an individual affected by the infringement.  Camera surveillance has taken place by tenants in their home environment, who is dependent on the company. The following factors have been considered in a mitigating direction.  The interest that the surveillance has been intended to protect has assessed as a legitimate interest and the surveillance has been necessary to safeguard this interest.  The violation has been committed through negligence rather than intentionally.  The infringement has been going on for a short time. Overall, the Data Inspectorate finds that an efficient, proportionate and deterrent penalty fee for the infringement found is 300,000 (three hundred thousand) kronor. Uppsalahem AB must therefore pay an administrative penalty fee of 300 000 kronor.Datainspektionen DI-2020-4534 1 1 (12) This decision was made by Director General Lena Lindgren Schelin after presentation by Gustav Linder.

The Privacy Protection Authority gives Lensway Group AB a reprimand according to article 58.2 b of the data protection regulation for violation of articles 12.2 and 12.6 of data protection regulation. Account of the supervisory matter Handling The Swedish Privacy Protection Agency (IMY) has started supervision of Lensway Group AB (the company) due to two complaints, mainly to investigate the Lensway Group AB has received and handled the complainant's request for deletion in a correct manner according to articles 12 and 17 of the data protection regulation. The complaints have been handed over to IMY, in its capacity as responsible supervisory authority pursuant to Article 56 i Postal address: data protection regulation. The handover has taken place from the supervisory authorities in that country Box 8114 where the complainants have filed their complaints (Finland and Denmark) pursuant to 104 20 Stockholm Regulation's provisions on cooperation in cross-border processing.

The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1032 2(8) Date: 2023-01-19 The proceedings at IMY have taken place through an exchange of letters. Against the background that it applies cross-border treatment, IMY has used the mechanisms for cooperation and uniformity found in Chapter VII of the Data Protection Regulation. Affected supervisory authorities have been the data protection authorities in Denmark, Norway and Finland. The complaints The complaints essentially state the following. Complaint 1 (Complaint from Finland with national diary number 1576/153/2020) The complainant has been in contact with the company on 20 February 2020 and requested deletion. The company has replied to the complainant that he needs to send his postal address to them so that they may send documents relating to his request to him. These actions would appellant sign and return. Furthermore, the company has requested that the complainant should verify their identity by sending a copy of their identity document via e-mail. Of for security reasons, the appellant has not been willing to submit what was requested of him. Complaint 2 (Complaint from Denmark with national diary number 2020-31-3616) The complainant has requested deletion of his information on lensway.dk. To accommodate request, the company has requested that he provide his social security number and submit a copy of their identity document. However, the company cannot tell the appellant why they need this information other than they need it to able to confirm his identity. The appellant disputes that the company needs to collect personal data to delete personal data. The complainant suggested that the company instead could confirm his identity by sending an email to the address that was registered to him but they refused. What the company has stated The company has in its opinion from 20 April, 12 May and 11 August 2022 in essentially stated the following. The company is responsible for the processing of personal data to which the complaints relate. Complaint 1 The company has received the complainant's request for deletion, but the complainant has not followed through the company's verification process applicable at the time. The company has requested that the complainant should send in a copy of your identity document. It is the only way that the company so far have been able to ensure the customer's identity on The copy would be sent via ordinary mail aisle. The company has also requested that the complainant submit a signed request for deletion. The company has so far not been able to receive this data digitally. To ensure that they have received original documents, they have asked the complainant to send them in this via regular mail. Complaint 2 The company has received the request for deletion on June 25, 2020, but the complainant has not completed the company's verification process applicable at the time. It is true that the company requested the appellant's social security number in the written record but it has was voluntary in providing this information. As an addition to the information in the written basis, the company has requested that the complainant submit a copy of his identity document. The company has so far not been able to identify the complainant in any other way. Date: 2023-01-19 way. The appellant has been asked to submit the information via ordinary post in order to ensure that the company has received documents in original. Regarding both complaints, the company has stated the following As regards the written request that both appellants would submit, states the company follows regarding which personal data was mandatory to provide and why the information was necessary. • Name is a mandatory information that is requested in order to confirm it data subject's identity. • E-mail address is a mandatory information requested to be used as a unique identifier of customers in the company's system. • Signature is a mandatory task for the company to ensure that the registrant has read the information and given his consent. The company states that they should always ensure that it is the right person who contacts them then it concerns requests to exercise a right under the Data Protection Regulation. Then the company was previously unable to identify the customer in a good and safe way when they contacted the company via customer service has the manual process via regular mail been the one they used. In this way, they have achieved a two-step verification. Functionality to enable confirmation of the customer's identity via customer service has not been in place. The customer relationship with the company can be established in two ways, either the customer implements one buy or the customer logs in to My Pages. When the customer creates an account on Mina Pages provide the customer with their email address and a confirmation email sent to the customer. The customer can then access one via the link in the email web page where he links a password to the e-mail address. The customer account is then created and the company thus receives a two-step verification. The appellants have used of the other means by which the customer relationship can be established. The complainants have made purchases with the company and they have then been identified via the company's payment service provided by Klarna. For most payment options, Klarna requires that the customer verifies himself via bankID. For certain payment methods, for example payment with credit card, the customer can choose not to have to verify themselves via bankID through Klarna's app. The company's existing digital contact route is Mina Sidor. However, there has been none functionality to handle requests to exercise a right under the data protection regulation on My Pages. Since April 2022, the company's customers can now request to be deleted or receive a copy of their personal data directly via My Pages. The customer's identity is then verified via regular login. Justification of the decision Applicable regulations, etc. According to Article 17.1, the data subject shall have the right to the personal data controller without unnecessary delay have their personal data deleted and the personal data controller shall be obliged to delete personal data about any of them without undue delay prerequisites listed in the article exist, for example if the information is not Date: 2023-01-19 are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they have been collected or consented to treatment is withdrawn. According to Article 12.2, the personal data controller must facilitate its exercise data subject's rights in accordance with Articles 15–22. Article 12.6 states that, without prejudice to the application of Article 11, it may personal data controller, if he has reasonable grounds to doubt its identity natural person who submits a request under Articles 15-21, request that additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject is provided. 2 In the European Data Protection Board's (EDPB) Guidelines 01/2022 on access is stated among other following. 65. If the data controller requests additional information that is necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject it shall personal data controller each time assess which information will enable the personal data controller to confirm the data subject identity and possibly ask additional questions of the requesting person or request the data subject to provide additional identifying information, if any proportionately (see section 3.3). Such additional information should not be more than the information originally needed to control it was recorded identity (authentication). In general, the fact that the the controller may request additional information to assess it data subject's identity does not lead to excessive demands and to the collection of personal data that is not relevant or necessary to strengthen the connection between the individual and the personal data requested. 3 \[…\] 73. It should be emphasized that the use of a copy of an identity document as a part of the authentication process poses a risk to the security of personal data and may lead to unauthorized or illegal processing, and therefore should be considered inappropriate, unless absolutely necessary, appropriate and in accordance with national legislation. In such cases, the personal data controllers should have systems that ensures a level of security suitable to reduce the higher risks of the freedom and rights of the data subject to receive such data. It is also important to note that identification using an identity card not necessarily helps in an online context (e.g. when using pseudonyms) about it the person concerned cannot provide any other evidence, e.g. further 4 properties that match the user account. 2EDPB, Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access, Version 1.0 (EDPB's Guidelines 01/2022 on the right of access). The guidelines have been out for public consultation and are awaiting final adoption. 3IMY's translation, original: In cases where the controller requests the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject, the controller shall each time assess what information will allow it to confirm the data subject's identity and possibly ask additional questions to the requesting person or request the data subject to present some additional identification elements, if it is proportionate (see section 3.3). Such additional information should not be more than the information initially needed for the verification of the data subject's identity (authentication). In general, the fact that the controller may request additional information to assess the data subject's identity cannot lead to excessive demands and to the collection of personal data which are not relevant or necessary 4o strengthen the link between the individual and the personal data requested. IMY's translation, original: It should be emphasized that using a copy of an identity document as a part of the authentication process creates a risk for the security of personal data and may lead to unauthorized or unlawful processing, and as such it should be considered inappropriate, unless it is strictly necessary, suitable, and in line with national law. In such cases the controllers should have systems in place that ensure a level of security appropriate to Date: 2023-01-19 The Swedish Privacy Protection Authority's assessment Based on the current complaints in the case, IMY has reviewed the company's action in these two individual cases. Has the company acted in accordance with 12.6 of the data protection regulation when the company requested current information from the complainants? Did Lensway Group have reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of the complainants? It is only when the personal data controller has reasonable grounds to doubt the identity with the person who made the request who receives additional information to confirm the identity is requested. What constitutes ""reasonable grounds"" in Article 12.6 of the Data Protection Regulation should assessed based on the circumstances of the individual case. The assessment of whether there is reasonable grounds to doubt in an individual case the identity of the person making the request is made normally in light of the information provided in connection with the request. The applies especially in situations where the person in charge of personal data lacks further knowledge about this person. However, the fact that an individual assessment is required does not preclude that routines are established for how the person in charge of personal data normally verifies it data subject's identity. The company has been given the opportunity to justify the individual assessment based on which it was made the appellants' situation if they considered that they had reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of the appellants when they presented their requests. Regarding both appellants, the company has i mainly stated the following. The company should always ensure that it is the right person who contacts them regarding requests to exercise a right under data protection regulation. The customer has not previously been able to be identified in a good and secure way when they contacted the company via Customer Service. Functionality for management of requests to exercise a right under the Data Protection Regulation have never existed at Customer Service or on My Pages. IMY states that it is not clear from the investigation in the case which data are the appellants submitted in connection with their request and if based on these there were any reason for the company to doubt their identity. However, IMY considers that against the background from what has emerged in the case, there is no reason to question the company's statement that the company had reason to doubt the identity of the complainants. In the assessment does the IMY consider the fact that the obligation to ensure the identity of the person making a the request also has the purpose of protecting data subjects against someone else doing it incorrectly requests in their name, which may lead to negative consequences for it registered. The risks of these negative consequences in case of false requests are particularly evident when it comes to more intrusive measures, such as the exercise of the right to erasure. IMY therefore finds that it has not been shown other than that the company in the relevant the cases had reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of the appellants. Has the information requested by Lensway Group been necessary to confirm the identity of the complainants? Even if the personal data controller has reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of those complainant, the personal data controller shall not collect more personal data than what which is necessary to enable identification of the requesting data subject. mitigate the higher risks for the rights and freedoms of the data subject to receive such data. It is also important to note that identification by means of an identity card does not necessarily help in the online context (e.g. with the use of pseudonyms) if the person concerned cannot contribute any other evidence, e.g. further characteristics matching to the user account. The Swedish Data Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1032 6(8) Date: 2023-01-19 The company has essentially stated the following regarding the necessity of that information those requested by both appellants. A copy of the identity document has been requested when it was the only way the company has so far been able to ensure the customer's identity. In addition to copy of identity document, the appellants should submit a written document. The information that has been requested in the written documentation and why it was necessary, is reported by the company essentially as follows. The name has been requested to confirm it data subject's identity. The email address has been requested to be used as a unique identifier of customers in the company's system. The signature has also been requested and is as per the company a necessary information in order for the company to be able to ensure that it registrant has read through the information and given his consent to the handling of request. Regarding whether the identity of the complainants has been verified, the company has stated that both the complainant has made purchases where they have been identified via the company's payment service as provided by Klarna. It appears from the company's opinion that it was not required that the company itself verified the true identity of the appellants when the customer relationship was established, i.e. upon purchase. IMY notes that the company cannot demand more personal data when the complainant wants to use it their rights than what was required when establishing the customer relationship. Copy of identity document and signature are information that the company has not requested the establishment of the customer relationship in these two current cases. Furthermore, IMY considers that according to The EDPB's guidelines on the right of access should the use of a copy of an identity document as part of the authentication process is considered inappropriate, unless it is absolute necessary, appropriate and in accordance with national legislation. IMY considers that the requirement to providing the personal data controller with a copy of their identity document is one interventional measure, which is only appropriate when the personal data controller previously has ensured the actual identity of the registered and then alternative less intrusive verification methods are inappropriate. IMY assesses that it has not emerged some circumstances that speak against other, less intrusive, verification methods could have been used in the current cases, for example login via My Pages or control questions. IMY notes that in the case it therefore does not emerged that the request for the copy of the identity document or the signature would have been absolutely necessary or appropriate. In light of this, IMY assesses that the copy of the identity document and the signature thus cannot be considered to have been necessary to confirm the identity of the appellants in accordance with Article 12.6 of the Data Protection Regulation. Has the company acted in accordance with 12.2 of the data protection regulation when the company requested that the complainants send the information by post? The next question is whether it has been permissible to require the appellants to send them the requested information to the company via ordinary post. In light of the requirements to facilitate the exercise of the data subject's rights i article 12.2 of the data protection regulation, it can only be accepted in exceptional cases that a personal data controller as the only contact means refers individuals to regular mail they must submit information to ensure their identities, for example if it is justifiable with regard to security reasons. The starting point should be that alternative ways of submitting requested information must be offered. The company has the Swedish Data Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1032 7(8) Date: 2023-01-19 this part essentially stated that they have demanded that the data be sent via ordinary post office to ensure that they have received the original written documentation. IMY assesses that sending a copy of an identity document can indeed involve special risks which may justify requiring that the act sent by post. This is provided that it is a necessary task in order to confirm the identity of the data subject. In the current cases, IMY assesses above that there was no copy of the identity document necessary to confirm the identity of the complainants. By demanding of the complainants that the information must also be sent via regular mail, IMY considers that the company has not made it easier for the complainants to exercise their right to erasure. IMY assesses thereby that the company thereby acted in violation of Article 12.2 of the data protection regulation. Choice of intervention From articles 58.2 i and 83.2 of the data protection regulation, it appears that IMY has the authority to impose administrative penalty fees in accordance with Article 83. Subject to the circumstances of the individual case, administrative penalty fees must be imposed in addition to or instead of the other measures referred to in Article 58.2, such as injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83.2 states which factors must taken into account when deciding whether administrative penalty charges are to be imposed and at determining the size of the fee. If it is a question of a minor violation, IMY gets as set out in recital 148 instead of imposing a penalty charge issue one reprimand according to article 58.2 b. Consideration must be given to aggravating and mitigating factors circumstances of the case, such as the nature, severity and duration of the infringement as well as previous violations of relevance. IMY notes the following relevant circumstances. It has of the investigation in the matter found that a copy of the identity document and signature are no longer requested by Lensway Group AB in the event of requests from registered users to exercise their right to deletion according to the data protection regulation. Furthermore, the established violations have occurred relatively far back in time (2020) and has affected two registrants. Against this one background, IMY finds that it is a question of such minor violations in that sense as referred to in reason 148 which means that Lensway Group AB must be given a reprimand according to Article 58.2 b of the Data Protection Regulation for the identified violations. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This decision has been taken by the special decision-maker lawyer Evelin Palmér after presentation by the lawyer Anna Mlynska.

IMY reprimands the Hospital Board in the Uppsala Region based on Article 58.2 b of the Data Protection Regulation for the established violation. Statement of the supervisory case Background The Hospital Board in the Uppsala Region (hereinafter the Hospital Board) conducts and performs care in accordance with the Health and Medical Services Act (2017:30), HSL, at Uppsala Academic Hospital and the Hospital in Enköping. On November 29, 2022, IMY received a notification of a personal data incident that occurred within the framework of the Hospital Board's care operations. The notification concerned the discovery that personal data about patients, including personal identification numbers and health information, during the period 2014–2022, had been processed in the Microsoft Outlook e-mail service. According to the notification, the incident was due to inadequate organizational routines or processes. Following the notification, IMY initiated supervision of the Hospital Board with the aim of checking whether the Hospital Board, in its activities as a healthcare provider according to HSL, has taken appropriate measures to ensure the protection of patients' Postal address: personal data when processing their personal data in the Microsoft Box 8114 104 20 Stockholm Outlook email service. As part of the supervision, an on-site inspection was carried out on 8 March 2023 at the Hospital Board's premises. Website: www.imy.se IMY's review covers the question of whether the Hospital Board meets the security requirements Email: imy@imy.se set out in Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation regarding the processing of personal data in the email service. The examination of the case has been limited to the question of whether Telephone: The Hospital Board has taken sufficient organizational and technical measures to 08-657 61 00Integrity Protection Authority Case number: IMY-2023-2522 2(9) Date: 2025-04-24 prevent and detect unauthorized processing of personal data in the email service. The review does not cover whether the processing is compatible with the regulations in the Data Protection Regulation in general. The Data Protection Regulation began to apply on 25 May 2018. IMY's supervision therefore covers the period from 25 May 2018 to 29 November 2022 when the notification of the personal data incident was received. Previous decisions On 26 January 2022, the IMY issued an administrative sanction against the Hospital Board after finding that the Hospital Board had processed personal data in violation of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) of the Data Protection Regulation by sending unencrypted sensitive personal data to patients and remitters in third countries and storing sensitive personal data in the email service (DI-2021-5595). The supervision was initiated in light of a personal data incident that was received by IMY in 2019. IMY assessed that the Hospital Board had not taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security that was appropriate in relation to the risk of the processing. Statement from the Hospital Board Within the framework of the supervision, the Hospital Board has stated, among other things, the following. Personal data responsibility The Hospital Board operates and provides care in accordance with HSL at Uppsala Academic Hospital and the Hospital in Enköping. The Hospital Board is the personal data controller according to Chapter 2, Section 6 of the Patient Data Act (2008:355), PDL. It is thus the personal data controller when it processes personal data about patients according to the purposes in Chapter 2, Section 4 of the PDL, such as documenting information in patient records. General information about the e-mail service Within the operations at Uppsala Academic Hospital and the Hospital in Enköping , the e-mail service Microsoft Outlook has been used since 2014. Microsoft provides the operation of the e-mail service in its data centers and provides support to Region Uppsala's administrative object Digital Workplace, which in turn administers the service within the region. The current e-mail service has around 8,300 users within the Hospital Board's operations, of which the majority (around 6,400) work with care. The personal data incident When processing a request for a register extract on November 24, 2022, it was discovered that personal data about patients had been sent in an email between employees within the framework of the Hospital Board's healthcare operations. The email stored in the email service contained Excel files with information about patients, including their name, social security number, number of hospital visits and number of days of care. After this discovery, the Hospital Board launched an investigation and then found additional unencrypted emails that had been sent during the period 2010–2022 containing personal data about patients. During the investigation, 15 e-mails with personal information about patients were discovered, as well as a recurring automatic mailing for personal identification number mergers.Integrity Protection Authority Case number: IMY-2023-2522 3(9) Date: 2025-04-24 The e-mails were between hospital staff and there were no indications of direct e-mail conversations between healthcare staff and patients. Technical and organizational measures There are governing document management plans for Uppsala University Hospital and Enköping Hospital, which state which documents and information volumes are handled, in which systems they should be stored and how long the information should be kept. There is also an archive manual that generally describes rules and procedures for disposal, including the disposal of e-mail, and a preservation and disposal plan for administrative documents, which sets out specific rules for the disposal of e-mail. When an e-mail message is received, the starting point is that it should be handled and registered in the system where the documents belong. The documents should then be deleted from the e-mail service. Correspondence of temporary and minor importance can be deleted if no longer relevant. At a regional level, there are guidelines and decisions stating that sensitive information should not be handled via e-mail. Uppsala Academic Hospital and Enköping Hospital each have their own rules for handling e-mail, which state that sensitive information, such as confidential information and sensitive personal data, may not be included in e-mail unless the files are encrypted. By default, e-mail is encrypted with TLS during transport. However, it cannot be guaranteed that all e-mail is encrypted with TLS during transport as this setting depends on the recipient/sender. If e-mail is used to send sensitive information, it must be encrypted using the encryption solutions that Region Uppsala has approved for sending such information. It is also stated in a regional director's decision from 2019 and in the guideline Information security for employees that if e-mail is to be used for sensitive information, the information must be encrypted. Other information channels where the importance of secure email is emphasized include, for example, manager letters and mandatory training courses. Despite the measures taken, there may be individuals who, out of ignorance or by mistake, email sensitive personal information unencrypted. The Hospital Board considers the maturity level regarding the secure handling of sensitive information to be high. However, since healthcare personnel do not primarily work in the email service, there is a risk that routines for the correct handling of sensitive information will become less known. Individual employees' email content is not monitored. Employees work based on a trust that is obtained in connection with employment to follow the internal regulations regarding storage and disposal. Only the individual employee has access to their email and can delete their emails that contain sensitive information. When an employee leaves, the email account is closed and all emails are deleted, but there is no permanent, technical functionality to automatically filter emails. However, work is underway to review the conditions for filtering emails older than 2014. Actions after the incident When the incident was discovered, it was reported to the data protection officer and meetings were called to quickly investigate the scope of the incident and to assess the type of information that was found. A group was appointed with responsibility for handling the incident and identifying and implementing the immediate actions that were required. In the emergency situation after the incident was discovered and reported, the identified emails were filtered. The emails that had previously been automatically generated were also deleted. Information was sent to employees to, among other things, clarify how sensitive personal data is handled correctly. The Hospital Board completed a risk and vulnerability analysis in the spring of 2022 – i.e. after IMY's previous decision (DI-2021-5595). This resulted in a list of measures (the activity list) to address a number of identified risks linked to, among other things, email handling. In connection with the current incident, the ongoing work on the activity list was re-prioritized. Work is ongoing on the identified measures. Examples of measures that have been implemented include investigating options for filtering out subsets of the email service and introducing functions in the email service that can inform and warn users who attempt to send emails containing personal identification numbers. The ability to send secure messages between users has been launched and work is also underway to connect the Uppsala Region to the national service Secure Digital Communication provided by the Digital Governance Authority (DIGG). As for the automatic mailings, they shall cease in the form that existed at the time of the incident. Justification of the decision Applicable rules Responsibility of the controller The controller is the person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. If the purposes and means of the processing are determined by Union law or the national law of the Member States, the controller or the specific criteria for his or her appointment may be prescribed in Union law or the national law of the Member States. This is stated in Article 4(7) of the Data Protection Regulation. According to Chapter 2, Section 6, first paragraph, of the PDL, a healthcare provider is the data controller for the processing of personal data carried out by the healthcare provider. In a region and a municipality, each authority that provides healthcare is the data controller for the processing of personal data carried out by the authority. The data controller has a responsibility to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate that the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. This is stated in the fundamental principles in Article 5, but is also regulated in Article 24 of the Regulation. The measures shall be implemented taking into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing and the risks, of varying likelihood and severity, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. The measures shall be reviewed and updated when necessary. 1https://www.digg.se/saker-digital-kommunikationIntegritetskyddsmyndigheten Case number: IMY-2023-2522 5(9) Date: 2025-04-24 The requirement for security when processing personal data, etc. Health data constitutes so-called sensitive personal data. It is prohibited to process such personal data according to Article 9(1) of the Data Protection Regulation, unless the processing is covered by one of the exceptions in Article 9(2) of the Regulation. Article 32(1) of the Data Protection Regulation states that the controller shall take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security that is appropriate in relation to the risk of the personal data processing. This shall be done taking into account the latest developments, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks, of varying degrees of likelihood and severity, to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. This includes, where appropriate, the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of the processing systems and services at all times, and a procedure for regularly testing, examining and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the processing. In assessing the appropriate level of security, particular account shall be taken of the risks presented by the processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or from unauthorised disclosure of or access to the personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. This is stated in Article 32(2) of the GDPR. Recital 75 of the GDPR sets out the factors to be taken into account when assessing the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons which may arise from the processing of personal data. Among other things, it must be taken into account whether the processing concerns personal data about health or about vulnerable natural persons, especially children, or whether the processing involves a large number of personal data and concerns a large number of data subjects. IMY's assessment Personal data responsibility The Hospital Board has stated that it operates and provides care at Uppsala Academic Hospital and the Hospital in Enköping and is the personal data controller according to Chapter 2, Section 6 of the PDL. The Hospital Board is thus the personal data controller for the personal data processing that the Hospital Board carries out within the framework of its care activities, which according to IMY includes the personal data processing that takes place when personal data about patients within the Hospital Board's operations are processed in the email service. The Hospital Board is thus the personal data controller for the processing of personal data in the email service in the case at issue. Technical and organizational measures The processing has entailed a high risk and required a high level of protection The Hospital Board conducts healthcare activities, which means that sensitive and particularly protected personal data is processed within the operations to a large extent. IMY can also state that the majority of the Hospital Board's users of the e-mail service consist of approximately 6,400 people who work with healthcare. This entails a significant risk that personal data, including sensitive and particularly protected data, may be handled in the e-mail service. That this is the case is supported by the Hospital Board's statement thatIntegritetsskyddsmyndigheten Filing number: IMY-2023-2522 6(9) Date: 2025-04-24 there is a risk that a user may accidentally send sensitive personal data in the e-mail service. The overall purpose of an email service is to be able to receive, distribute and communicate information. In a previous supervision of the Hospital Board (DI-2021- 5595), IMY has assessed that email systems are generally an unsuitable storage location for sensitive personal data. An email system is exposed to the internet, which means that the data in the system is at risk of being accessed by unauthorized persons. The fact that it is primarily the individual users who have knowledge of what data the users handle in the email service can further cause difficulties for the data controller to ensure that data is not handled in the service in an unauthorized manner. The processing of personal data in an email service thus inherently entails special risks. Against this background, IMY believes that high demands must be placed on the technical and organizational measures that the Hospital Board needs to take to ensure an appropriate level of security regarding the processing of personal data in the email service. The Hospital Board has not taken sufficient security measures As is clear from Article 32(2) of the Data Protection Regulation, when assessing the appropriate level of security, particular consideration shall be given to the risks presented by the processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or to unauthorised disclosure of or access to the personal data processed. The controller shall therefore take measures to avoid personal data incidents as far as possible. 2 The measures may include, among other things, the ability to continuously ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of the processing systems and services, as well as a procedure for regularly testing, examining and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the processing. Against this background, it is important that the controller takes measures to be able to prevent and detect unauthorised processing of personal data. The investigation into the case shows that during the period in question there were central documents and rules applied within the Hospital Board and which, among other things, aim at the handling of documents and information volumes and the handling of personal data in e-mail. These state, among other things, that privacy-sensitive information such as personal identification numbers, confidential information and sensitive personal data may not appear in e-mail unless the files are encrypted with the approved encryption solution. Employees may also undergo mandatory training, including regarding information security and handling of personal data in the e-mail service. The Hospital Board had thus taken a number of measures to prevent the unauthorized processing of personal data in the e-mail service. In light of the fact that in the personal data incident in question, it emerged that sensitive and particularly protected personal data was processed in the e-mail service, it is clear, however, that employees did not follow the guidelines that existed regarding the processing of such personal data in the e-mail service. It can also be stated that there were set 2EU Court of Justice judgment of 14 December 2023, Natsionalna agentsia za prihodite, case C-340/21, ECLI:EU:C:2023:986, paragraph 30.Integrity Protection Authority Case number: IMY-2023-2522 7(9) Date: 2025-04-24 services for automatic mailings that continuously sent personal data about patients via e-mail in violation of the guidelines. According to IMY, the measures taken to prevent unauthorized processing of personal data in the e-mail service have primarily included organizational security measures, including rules, guidelines and training on how personnel working within the operation should handle sensitive data. The Hospital Board has, after the incident, taken a number of technical measures to prevent unauthorized processing, for example, functions to inform and warn users who attempt to send e-mails containing personal identification numbers. However, no such functions were in place at the time of the incident. Several of the e-mail messages involved in the incident had been stored in the e-mail service for a long time, which suggests that the Hospital Board did not have an effective procedure for following up and evaluating the effectiveness of the measures taken. The fact that the discovery of a large amount of sensitive and particularly sensitive personal data that had been processed for a long time in the e-mail service occurred when processing a request for a register extract also indicates a lack of proactive measures to detect unauthorized processing. IMY further notes that at the time of the personal data incident, it was up to individual employees to detect and delete e-mail messages containing sensitive or particularly sensitive personal data. Overall, IMY assesses that the Hospital Board has not taken sufficient measures to prevent and detect unauthorized personal data processing in the e-mail service. The Hospital Board has therefore, from 25 May 2018 to 29 November 2022, in its capacity as controller, processed personal data in breach of Article 32(1) by failing to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing of patients' personal data in the email service. Choice of intervention It is clear from Article 58(2) and Article 83(2) of the GDPR that the IMY has the power to impose an administrative penalty. Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, an administrative penalty shall be imposed in addition to or instead of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2), such as injunctions and prohibitions. Article 83(2) further states which factors shall be taken into account when deciding whether an administrative penalty shall be imposed and when determining the amount of the penalty. Aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the case shall be taken into account, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement and previous infringements of relevance. In the case of a minor infringement, the IMY may, as set out in recital 148, issue a reprimand in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) instead of imposing a penalty payment. The IMY has assessed above that the Hospital Board has processed personal data in violation of Article 32(1) of the Data Protection Regulation. A violation of that provision may result in a penalty fee. During the period in question, the Hospital Board has not taken sufficient technical and organizational measures to prevent and detect unauthorized processing of personal data in the e-mail service. The insufficient measures have led to a large amount of sensitive and particularly sensitive personal data being processed in the e-mail service in violation of the Hospital Board's guidelines. In a previous supervisory decision from IMY, the Hospital Board has been ordered to pay an administrative sanction fee for, among other things, a violation of Article 32(1) when handling personal data in the e-mail service (DI-2021-5595). Following IMY's previous decision, the Hospital Board completed a risk and vulnerability analysis that resulted in an activity list to address identified risks linked to, among other things, e-mail use. In connection with the personal data incident in question in this case, reprioritizations were made in the ongoing work on the activity list. The activity list shows both implemented and planned technical and organizational measures that, among other things, aim to increase the ability to prevent and detect unauthorized processing of personal data. The Hospital Board has also decided to cease the automatic mailing of personal data number mergers in the form that was current at the time of the incident. In a comprehensive assessment of the circumstances of the case, IMY considers that it is not proportionate to decide on a penalty fee for the violation that was found within the framework of this supervision. The Hospital Board shall therefore, instead of a penalty fee, be given a reprimand in accordance with 58.1 b of the Data Protection Regulation. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This decision has been made by the head of unit Christelle Bourquin after a presentation by IT and information security specialist Johnny Gordon Tornesjö.

The Data Protection Authority's decision The Privacy Protection Authority states that Granit Bostad Beritsholm AB (556529–2215) during the period 1 November 2022 up to and including 11 December 2024 has processed personal data in violation of Article 6.1 and Article 13 i 1 the data protection regulation by conducting camera surveillance without a legal basis i the company's property at Limhamnsvägen 22a in Malmö. Granit Bostad Beritsholm AB also does not meet the requirement for information to the registered regarding the camera surveillance. Administrative penalty fee IMY decides with the support of articles 58.2 and 83 of the data protection regulation that Granit Bostad Beritsholm AB must pay an administrative sanction fee of 200,000 (two hundred thousand) kroner for the violations of the articles noted above 6.1 and 13 of the data protection regulation. Order The Privacy Protection Authority orders Granit Bostad Beritsholm AB according to article 58.2 d of the data protection regulation that no later than four weeks after this decision has been made force take steps to ensure that 1. the company ceases the camera surveillance of all places in the property except the garage. 2. the camera surveillance signs contain information about the company's identity and and contact information for the company, in the form of an email address or telephone number. 2. Statement of the supervisory matter 2.1 Background IMY has initiated supervision of Granit Bostad Beritsholm AB (the company) with the aim of investigating a complaint that the company conducts unauthorized camera surveillance in apartment buildings on Limhamnsvägen 22a in Malmö as well as shortcomings in its obligation to provide information. 2.2 What emerged in the case The appellant has essentially stated the following. The appellant lives in the rental property at Limhamnsvägen 22a in Malmö where extensive camera surveillance is carried out. There is cameras at three main entrances, at elevators and at apartment doors on the ground floor as well several cameras in the basement corridor next to the entrance to the storage room, laundry room and sauna. There are also several cameras in the garage, bicycle storage, garbage room, recycling room and indoors at the entrance at the rear of the property. The complainant has contacted the landlord regarding the extent of camera surveillance and the lack of information. There is no physical information on site, or otherwise, such as visitors and tenants can take part in. The complainant believes that there should be information in general about treatment of personal data to the tenants, such as logging the use of tags for 1 regarding the processing of personal data and on the free flow of such data and on the cancellation of aver med directive 95/46/EC (general data protection regulation). The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 3(16) Date: 2024-12-11 entry. The area where the property is located is generally very quiet without further ado problem, therefore the scope of the camera surveillance should be done in a way that minimizes the uptake in relation to the problems. In December 2022, the appellant received response from the landlord that they should review the need for information regarding the camera surveillance. The complainant has not received any concrete information about measures and therefore do not feel safe about personal data, which is collected through camera surveillance, is processed correctly and securely and in accordance with the data protection regulation. The company has essentially stated the following. In connection with the company taking over the property on November 1, 2022, they also took over the operation of the camera surveillance system. It is unknown when the surveillance began, an extensive one system reconstruction took place in 2013. The area has historically had problems with incidents in the form of e.g. bicycle thefts, attempted burglaries, warehouse burglaries, car burglaries, vandalism and graffiti in public areas. Most incidents have been investigated successfully. The company operates camera surveillance at Limhamnsvägen 22a in Malmö and is personal data controller for the processing of personal data. The camera surveillance takes place with 18 cameras that are mounted in the garage, basement, storage room, operation, laundry room and garbage room. The cameras are aimed at the garage, basement entrance to the gym, bicycle storage, central heating, outside office, corridor to laundry room and garage, stairwell A-C, basement on staircase C, storage room and garbage room. The camera surveillance takes place around the clock because incidents and crimes occur at all hours of the day, on weekdays and weekends. Recording takes place when motion is detected with all cameras. None happens real-time monitoring and no audio recording. There have been burglaries and vandalism during varying times of the day, hence the choice of time for the surveillance. Image material saved for 14 days due to the fact that there is only one trustee and the office does not have fixed staffing hours. It can also take time to detect an incident. Three people have access to recorded footage. The purpose of the surveillance is to counter and prevent crime, create a safe living environment, document documentation in the event of incidents and counteract large costs in the event of extensive missorting and nuisance due to vermin. Furthermore, the camera surveillance takes place in deterrent purpose. The cameras are appreciated by the tenants and they have one deterrent function in terms of burglary and attempted fraud. The company has generally received a positive impression from the residents regarding the camera surveillance. The company has received, among other things, a documented balancing of interests, a blueprint which shows where cameras are mounted, screenshots from all cameras, copy of older ones signs and new signs, map image, group structure that the company is part of, a compilation of incidents and police reports taken from the police and a copy on privacy policy. 2.3 The extent of IMY's review of the matter IMY's review of the case is limited to the questions about it personal data processing that the camera surveillance entails, since 1 November 2022, has had a legal basis according to the data protection regulation and if the company has fulfilled the requirement on information according to § 15 of the Camera Surveillance Act (2018:1200) and the obligation to provide information in accordance with Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation. IMY's review in this supervisory matters do not include whether the company's camera surveillance is carried out in accordance with the others current regulations in the data protection regulation. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 4(16) Date: 2024-12-11 3. Justification of the decision 3.1 Which legislation applies to current camera surveillance? Camera surveillance typically means that personal data is processed. If and to what extent it is permissible for camera surveillance to be regulated in the data protection regulation and the camera surveillance act. 3.1.1 The Data Protection Regulation According to Article 2.1, the Data Protection Regulation shall be applied to the processing of personal data that is fully or partially processed automatically. Of Article 4.1 i the data protection regulation states that any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person is a personal data. According to Article 4.2, treatment is intended an action or combination of actions concerning personal data, for example collection, registration, storage, reading and deletion. If a surveillance camera films an identifiable person, or someone else personal data, personal data is processed and the rules in the data protection regulation must be followed. IMY states that the company's surveillance cameras films identifiable persons and that the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation thereby applies to current personal data processing. The personal data controller must identify the legal basis in Article 6 i the data protection regulation before the camera surveillance begins, and is responsible - both towards the registered and in relation to the supervisory authority - because the principles 2 if the processing of personal data in Article 5 of the data protection regulation is complied with. The principle of liability in Article 5.2 of the Data Protection Regulation means that it personal data controller must be able to demonstrate that Article 5.1 has been complied with, which means that the application of the data protection regulation often needs to be documented. 3.1.2 The Camera Surveillance Act The Camera Surveillance Act (2018:1200), is a supplementary law in relation to data protection regulation. It appears from § 3 § 1 of the Camera Surveillance Act that with camera surveillance means a television camera, another optical-electronic instrument or a comparable equipment which, without being operated on site, is used in a in such a way as to involve permanent or regularly repeated personal surveillance. The current camera surveillance is not operated on site and involves a permanent surveillance of residents and other visitors to the property. IMY assesses that also the camera surveillance act is therefore applicable to the surveillance in question. 3.2 Is the company responsible for personal data? According to Article 4.7 of the Data Protection Ordinance, personal data controller means the natural or legal person who, alone or together with others, decides the purposes and means for the processing of personal data. Crucial to the question of who is responsible for personal data is who or who have decided why and how the processing takes place, and exerts an influence on which personal data is collected and processed, how long they are stored and who has access. The assessment of who 2 Prop. 2017/18:105, New Data Protection Act, p. 47 f. Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 5(16) Date: 2024-12-11 or who is responsible for personal data for certain processing must always be based on them the actual circumstances of the specific case. 3 Granit Bostad Beritsholm AB has stated that the company is responsible for personal data the processing of personal data that takes place through current camera surveillance on Limhamnsvägen 22a in Malmö. IMY believes that this is supported in the investigation and assesses because the company is responsible for personal data for the person in question the processing of personal data in the sense referred to in Article 4.7 i data protection regulation. 3.3 Has the camera surveillance had a legal basis in data protection regulation? In order for the processing of personal data to be legal, there must be support in at least one on the legal grounds stated in Article 6.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. The company has stated that current camera surveillance is supported by the legal basis stated in the article 6.1 f of the data protection regulation, which is the so-called balancing of interests. There is three prerequisites that must all be met for the camera surveillance to work can take place with the support of Article 6.1 f of the data protection regulation: The personal data controllers must be able to demonstrate 1) that there is a legitimate interest, 2) that the current processing of personal data is necessary to achieve that interest, and 3) that the legitimate interest (guarding interest) weighs in a balance heavier than the basic freedoms and rights of the data subjects (privacy interest) on the place. 4 3.3.1 Is there a legitimate interest? In order for the interest that the surveillance intends to protect to be considered justified, it needs it normally has support in relevant national law or in EU law. A condominium association that wants to protect the property, health and life of the condominium owners can be considered to have such a legitimate interest. Protecting property, health and life can constitute a legitimate interest in camera surveillance, provided it is in question of an actual interest and not an interest which is fictitious or speculative at the time for the processing of personal data. This usually means that a crime must have occurred or other incidents which mean that there is a concrete need for surveillance. The company has stated that the purpose of the camera surveillance is to increase security and security for the tenants, prevent and investigate crime and protect the property property. The company has also stated that the monitoring is done as a deterrent. The surveillance makes it more difficult to break into apartments, attics and basements because people are watched on the way out with any stolen goods. It appears from the investigation that since 2019 there have been incidents in the form of i.a. car break-in, theft, vandalism, graffiti, burglary and attempted burglary. IMY assesses that the company has one legitimate interest in conducting camera surveillance to increase security and security for tenants, preventing and investigating crime and protecting property. 3.3.2 Is the camera surveillance necessary to achieve the legitimate interest? That the camera surveillance carried out must be necessary means that it is justified the interest cannot reasonably be protected as effectively in other ways as in smaller 3 EDPB guidelines 07/2020 regarding the concepts of personal data controller and personal data processor in the GDPR, version 2.0, adopted on 7 July 2021, 07/2020, paragraph 25. 4 Dom Rīgas satiksme, C-13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph 28. 5 Dom TK, C-708/18, EU:C:2019:1064, paragraph 42. 6EDPB Guidelines 3/2019 for the processing of personal data through video devices, adopted on 29 January 2020, point 20. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 6(16) Date: 2024-12-11 extent infringes on the fundamental freedoms and rights of the registered. It should taken into account if the cameras have been used in a way that limits the intrusion into it the personal integrity that the surveillance entails without jeopardizing it for the sake of it the effectiveness of the surveillance, which includes an assessment of whether it is, for example, enough that the camera surveillance is limited to certain places or times. Necessity must be tested together with the principle of data minimization in the article 5.1 c of the data protection regulation, which means that personal data collected must be adequate, relevant and not too extensive in relation to the purposes for which they are treated. From the investigation into the matter, it appears that alternative measures have been taken by restrict access to the property using access systems with tags, upgrade of stronger gate automation, installation of grilles in front of doors and motion detectors for automatic lighting and improvement of lighting. There is lighting at the basement entrance which is turned on when there is movement due to people moving close to tenants balconies during the evening. The measures were taken by previous owners and have not been reduced the incidents to a sufficient extent according to the company. The company states that in the areas where cameras are installed, it has had a deterrent function regarding burglary and attempted fraud. IMY states that previous property owners have taken alternative measures and less privacy-sensitive measures to camera surveillance and that the surveillance according to the company has had a deterrent effect. IMY assesses that even if the company neither has limited the coverage in time or coverage area, e.g. By masking, with the aim of reducing the invasion of privacy, the surveillance can be considered to be necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the company and the residents. 3.3.3 Does the security interest outweigh the privacy interest at the site? That the legitimate interest that the surveillance intends to protect (the surveillance interest) in a balance must weigh more heavily than the basic free and rights (the interest in privacy), means that the personal data controller must evaluate the risks of infringement of the data subject's rights. The decisive criterion is the intensity of the infringement for the data subject's rights and freedoms, which i.a. can is defined based on the information content, the scope, the situation in question and the 8 registered actual interests. Furthermore, the type of personal data processing in question and how this is done concretely. At 9 the balance between the privacy interest and the surveillance interest must also be taken into account were recorded reasonable expectations at the time and in connection with the treatment of 10 its personal data. With regard to the privacy interest, IMY notes the following. All camera surveillance means an intrusion into the individual's privacy. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has i guidelines, which are indicative of how the provisions of the data protection regulation should interpreted, stating that data subjects should not reasonably expect to be subject to surveillance in residential areas. IMY believes that camera surveillance in residential environments such as starting point is very sensitive from a privacy point of view. The privacy interest varies however, depending on the specific area of coverage. Regarding the surveillance interest, the company has stated that many people move in the area where the property is located. Partly because it i.a. is there a beach in the vicinity that many people visit. The company refers to information in 7 8 Dom TK, C-708/18, EU:C:2019:1064, paragraphs 46-48 and 50. EDPB guidelines 3/2019, point 32. 9 CJEU judgment in case C-708/18 TK, paragraph 57. 10Recital 47 of the data protection regulation and Dom TK C-708/18 TK, paragraph 58. 11EDPB's guidelines 3/2019, point 37. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 7(16) Date: 2024-12-11 The Crime Prevention Council's latest edition of Crime statistics, reported crimes 2023. I edition shows that in metropolitan municipalities such as Malmö is reported in large numbers crime due to the high throughput of non-residents in municipality, which explains the high crime rate in the area. The company has received with a compilation of 25 incidents that occurred in the area where the property is located during the period 13 September 2017 and 13 December 2023. The company has also submitted a compilation of incidents and police reports relating to the year 2019 up to and including the year 2024, taken from the police, which occurred in the area where the property is located and the area around the property. The company has further stated that the police are not allowed to hand out reports and events relating to the property. IMY considers that the company has shown that there were crimes and incidents in the area there the property is located. However, it has not been shown that these crimes and incidents have occurred in the property or in the places in the property that are guarded. IMY therefore does not consider that the basis that the company submitted affects IMY's assessment the surveillance interest in the property in question where the company operates camera surveillance. Entrances and stairwells Camera surveillance that takes place inside the entrance or in the stairwell of apartments is seen generally as particularly sensitive to privacy because the residents are monitored when they coming to and leaving their residences. It enables mapping of the residents habits, visits and social circle. It is now a question of camera surveillance around the clock entrances to all stairwells, both stairwells A, B and C, and one more basement entrance the property by a gym. Within the catchment area of stairwell B there is also one guest apartment, which means that several different people can be met by the security, which increases the privacy interest somewhat. The interest in privacy is somewhat weakened by it the fact that the surveillance is partly aimed at protecting the people who become subject of the surveillance. In an overall assessment, IMY considers that the privacy interest in entrances and stairwells weighs heavily. With regard to the surveillance interest, IMY notes the following. The company has left one account of crimes and incidents that occurred during the period 13 May 2019 to and including by 31 December 2023. The documentation shows that a burglar alarm has been triggered in stairwell B and C due to unauthorized access, an alarm about suspected unauthorized access i stairwell B, burglary in stairwell B, alarm about unauthorized access in stairwell B, alarm at scaffolding on the outside of the property, broken windowpanes to the stairwell and a police intervention in an apartment which resulted in damage to the apartment and stairwell. The company has further stated that unauthorized access to the property occurs three to four times a year through emergency exits damaged as a result and that damage in the form of graffiti has occurred in the stairwells. The company has stated that there have been problems in the then owner's property portfolio in Malmö with unauthorized access, i especially drug addicts, which caused insecurity for tenants. IMY notes that there have been incidents and crimes in the property, e.g. problems with unauthorized access in the property, which IMY understands affects the safety of the residents. However, IMY believes that these are incidents that are not of a sufficiently serious nature to the security interest in entrances and stairwells shall be considered to outweigh the privacy interest at the site. In an overall assessment, IMY considers that the security interest in entrances and stairwells is relatively light. In light of the incidents that occurred at the locations, IMY assesses that the surveillance interest at the site weighs relatively lightly. Considering the weighty the privacy interest at the locations, IMY assesses that the company's interest in camera surveillance of entrances and stairwells does not outweigh the residents' interest in that do not be monitored by cameras there. The Swedish Data Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 8(16) Date: 2024-12-11 IMY therefore believes that the camera surveillance of entrances and stairwells cannot be supported a balancing of interests according to Article 6.1 f of the data protection regulation. Neither has it emerged that it would be possible to support the surveillance on someone else legal basis in Article 6.1 of the data protection regulation. The company has thus treated personal data in violation of Article 6.1 of the data protection regulation. Basement, storage, operations, laundry room, garbage room and corridors to the sites Camera surveillance of bicycle storage, garbage rooms, storerooms and the like are not considered the same sensitive to privacy such as camera surveillance in connection with apartments, because they residents do not have to pass through these spaces to get to and from their homes, nor does it stay there for long periods of time. However, IMY notes that the company operates extensive camera surveillance around the clock in the property. The residents because of this cannot escape the camera surveillance, which speaks for a higher risk of breach of privacy. However, the risk of privacy breaches is somewhat reduced in the case of the surveillance of said spaces, especially during later evening and night time, then residents to a lesser extent can be assumed to stay on the sites. The interest in privacy is somewhat weakened by the fact that the surveillance is partly aimed at protecting them persons who have been subject to surveillance. IMY assesses that the privacy interest in basement, storage, operation, laundry room, garbage room and corridors to the sites weigh relatively heavily. With regard to the surveillance interest, IMY notes the following. Of the account of crime and incidents that the company has provided show that there has been an alarm about a suspect unauthorized access to the power station, alarm that the door to the waste room has been broken open and alarm about damaged door to garbage room probably due to attempted burglary. In addition to these incidents has there been vandalism in the form of graffiti on the sites. IMY notes that it it is required that there is an actual interest in monitoring, i.e. it should have occurred actual incidents in the places that are monitored by cameras. IMY believes that the company has shown that it there have been incidents at some locations that are monitored, but not at all locations. The are not mainly about recurring incidents either. IMY assesses all in all, that even if some incidents have occurred, the security interest weighs in places relatively easily. Overall, IMY assesses that the company's interest in camera surveillance of basements, storerooms, operation, laundry room, garbage room and corridors to the places do not weigh more than the occupants interest in not being camera-surveillance there. IMY therefore considers that the camera surveillance of the basement, storeroom, operation, laundry room, garbage room and corridors to the sites cannot be supported on a balance of interests according to Article 6.1 f in the data protection regulation. Nor has it emerged that it would be possible to support the monitoring on any other legal basis in Article 6.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. The company has thus processed personal data in violation of Article 6.1 i the data protection regulation also in this part. Garage IMY also considers here that camera surveillance of garages is less sensitive, because individuals do not need to pass these spaces to get to their homes, and do not rather stays there for longer periods of time. This means that the privacy interest weighs slightly lighter on the spot. With regard to the surveillance interest, IMY states the following. The investigation shows that the garage door was hit on one occasion in 2023, the garage was burglarized in 2019 and in 2023 when cars were robbed of steering wheels and headlights. IMY notes that in the garage contains property susceptible to theft, which differs from other places in the property, Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 9(16) Date: 2024-12-11 for example, basement and laundry room. It is a different kind of place that guarded and other property that must be protected than in the property in general, which affects the assessment of the security interest, which is considered to weigh more heavily in the garage than in the others places in the property. IMY therefore assesses that the company's interest in camera surveillance of the garage, even if a incident is a number of years back in time, weighs somewhat more than the interest of the residents not to be monitored by cameras there. The company thus has a legal basis according to Article 6.1 f i the data protection regulation regarding the monitoring of the garage. IMY's summary assessment In summary, IMY assesses that the company has a legal basis according to Article 6.1 f i the data protection regulation for the camera surveillance that takes place in the garage. On the contrary the company lacks a legal basis according to Article 6 of the Data Protection Ordinance for its monitoring i other. 3.4 Has the company fulfilled the requirement for information and its obligation to inform? 3.4.1 The requirement for information according to the Camera Surveillance Act Section 15 of the Camera Surveillance Act sets out a requirement to provide information on camera surveillance must be provided through clear signage or on something else effective way. The provision refers to the actual use of camera surveillance equipment and not the processing of personal data that the monitoring entails. The provision contains no requirements regarding what information must be provided and the obligation to provide information may thus be considered fulfilled if the person conducting the surveillance in a clear way provides information that camera surveillance takes place in a certain location. From the investigation into the matter, it appears that there are signs on the entrance doors, at the gate and the door as well as on the facade. The company has submitted a drawing of the basement including garage and a drawing of all stairwells (A, B and C). The drawings show that signs sits at all entrances to the property. IMY assesses that the company has provided information about the surveillance through clear signage and thereby fulfilled the information requirement in Section 15 of the Camera Surveillance Act. 3.4.2 The information obligation in the data protection regulation IMY must also assess whether the company has lived up to its obligations to inform the processing of personal data according to Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation. Article 13 i the data protection regulation regulates which information must be provided when the personal data is collected from the data subject. In case of camera surveillance is considered 13 personal data is collected from the data subject. 12 Prop. 2017/18:231, New Camera Surveillance Act, p. 87 f. 13 Article 29 working group, Guidelines on transparency according to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, WP260rev.01, point 26 and EDPB's Guidelines 3/2019, point 110. However, see the Court of Appeal in Stockholm's judgment of 26 January 2023 in case no. 1552-22 in which the Court of Appeal judged that it is not Article 13 but Article 14 that should be applicable to camera surveillance. The judgment has been appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (case no. 870-23) and has thus not gained legal force. With taking into account the position that the EDPB's guidelines have according to the regulation and pending a legally binding decision does IMY base its assessment on the EDPB's guidelines and that it is Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation that must be applied in the case. In the case, the Supreme Administrative Court (HFD) has requested a preliminary ruling from the EU Court regarding article 13 or 14 is applicable in case of monitoring with a body-worn camera. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 10(16) Date: 2024-12-11 According to Article 13.1 of the Data Protection Regulation, the personal data controller shall, when the personal data is obtained, provide information to the registrant about e.g. following. • The identity and contact details of the person in charge of personal data. • Contact details for any data protection officer. • The purposes of the processing for which the personal data is intended as well as the legal basis for the processing. • If the legal basis is Article 6.1 f (balancing of interests), which is justified interest the processing aims to safeguard. • The recipients or the categories of recipients who are to take part the personal data, where applicable. According to Article 13.2 of the data protection regulation, the personal data controller shall, at the collection of the personal data, provide information to the registrant about i.a. following. • The period during which the personal data will be stored or the criteria which is used to determine this period. • That there is a right to request access to the personal data controller and correction or deletion of personal data or restriction of processing relating to the data subject or to object to processing. • That the registered person has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. From article 13.4 it appears that points 1, 2 and 3 of article 13 shall not be applied if and in insofar as the data subject already has the information. The investigation shows that when the company took possession of the property in 2022, it is on the signage lack of information about i.a. the purpose of the personal data processing (the camera surveillance), the identity of the personal data controller (the company), contact details for the person in charge of personal data (the company), a statement that they monitored can exercise their rights according to the data protection regulation, for how long image material is stored and reference to where to find out more about the processing of personal data. During the course of the inspection, the signs were updated, however, without the company's involvement. On the new signs, information about the personal data controller has been missing identity (the company) and contact details of the person in charge of personal data (the company) at the signs. IMY notes that the company has stated that the signage will clarified with information that the company is responsible for personal data the camera surveillance. The company has stated that information about the processing of personal data that is ongoing at camera surveillance is provided to those registered via the company's website which updated on June 4, 2024 with full information. On August 29, 2024 the website was updated with i.a. additional information about the purpose of the camera surveillance and a clarification that the company is responsible for personal data. Those registered have previously been referred to the company's property manager's website with information about the camera surveillance. That information has been available since on November 1, 2022. The website was redesigned and the information updated November 27, 2023. At that time there was no information about who it was personal data controller is, contact details for the personal data controller, information about the purpose of the camera surveillance, legal basis for the surveillance and the Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 11(16) Date: 2024-12-11 how long the surveillance material is stored. If the legal basis is Article 6.1 f i the data protection regulation (balancing of interests), it must also be stated which is entitled interest the processing aims to safeguard. Information about this must also appear the recipients or the categories of recipients who will have access to the personal data i occurring cases. There was also missing information that the registered have the right to of the person in charge of personal data (the company) request deletion of personal data or to object to treatment. The property manager has informed orally in connection with showing apartments about the camera surveillance and referred to the company's website for more information. The manager has also informed all new tenants about the camera surveillance and where they can find more information about it. Information about camera surveillance does not have sent out in physical form to the registered and not provided to the registered on other way. IMY assesses that there have been deficiencies in the first and second layers of information, but there is not a total lack of information about the processing of personal data. IMY states that even if the property manager when showing apartments orally has informed that camera surveillance takes place and referred to the company's website for more information, other than the residents are also staying in the guarded spaces, such as guests to the residents, craftsmen, etc. These have thus been referred to the signs about camera surveillance. The signs about camera surveillance have been updated during the inspection time as well as the website with information about the camera surveillance. Although the new ones the signs and website contain more information than before, IMY finds that there are still some deficiencies in the first layer of information. On the camera surveillance signs are missing information about the personal data controller identity (the company) and contact details for the company, in the form of an email address or phone number. According to IMY, this information can be obtained with relatively simple means be added to the existing signs. IMY assesses overall that the information which has been submitted does not meet all requirements according to Article 13.1 and 13.2 i data protection regulation. IMY therefore states that since 1 November 2022 the company has processed personal data in violation of Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation. 3.5 Choice of intervention In the event of violations of the data protection regulation, IMY has a number of corrective measures powers, including reprimands, injunctions and penalty charges. It follows from article 58.2 a–j of the data protection regulation. IMY shall impose penalty fees in addition to or in lieu of other corrective measures as referred to in Article 58(2) of the Data Protection Regulation, depending on the circumstances i each individual case. If it is a question of a minor violation, the supervisory authority may, under recital 148 of the Data Protection Regulation, issue a reprimand instead of imposing one penalty fee. Consideration must be given to aggravating and mitigating circumstances i the case, such as the nature, severity and duration of the breach and previous violations of relevance. Each supervisory authority must ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty charges in each individual case are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The stated in Article 83.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. In article 83.2, the factors that must Date: 2024-12-11 taken into account in determining whether an administrative penalty fee should be imposed and at the assessment of the size of the penalty fee. When assessing the amount of the penalty fee, among other things, must be taken into account article 83.2 a (the nature, severity and duration of the violation), c (the measures which the personal data controller has taken) and k (other aggravating or mitigating factor for example direct or indirect financial gain). The EDPB has adopted guidelines on the calculation of administrative penalty fees according to the data protection regulation which aims to create a harmonized method and principles for calculation of penalty fees. 14 According to article 83.5 of the data protection regulation, in the event of violations of articles 6 and 13 of the data protection regulation administrative penalty fees are imposed on up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of companies, of up to 4 percent of the total global the annual turnover during the previous budget year, depending on which value is the highest. When determining the maximum amount of a penalty charge to be imposed on a company shall the definition of the concept of company be used as used by the EU Court of Justice application of Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU (see recital 150 i data protection regulation). The court's practice shows that this includes every unit that carries out economic activities, regardless of the legal form of the entity and the way of doing so financing as well as even if the unit in the legal sense consists of several physical or 15 legal persons. The rules for group liability in EU competition law revolve around the concept economic unit. A parent company and a subsidiary company are considered part of the same economic entity when the parent company exercises decisive influence over the subsidiary. The decisive influence (ie control) can be achieved either through ownership or by agreement. Jurisprudence shows that one hundred percent or almost 100% ownership implies a presumption for control to be considered to exist. However, the presumption can be rebutted if the company provides sufficient evidence that 16 proof that the subsidiary acts independently on the market. 3.5.1 A penalty fee must be imposed IMY has found that the company has violated Article 6.1 of the data protection regulation by without legal basis to conduct camera surveillance in the company's property on Limhamnsvägen 22a in Malmö during the period 1 November 2022–11 December 2024. The company has further processed personal data in violation of Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation by not fulfill the requirement for information to the registered regarding the camera surveillance. IMY states that the processing of personal data through camera surveillance of private persons in direct connection with their homes has taken place without a legal basis. Against this one background, IMY assesses that it is not a question of such minor violations as referred to in recital 148 of the data protection regulation. IMY thus finds that a penalty fee cannot be replaced by a reprimand. The European Court of Justice has clarified that it is required that the person in charge of personal data has committed a Violation intentionally or negligently to administrative penalty fees 14EDPB Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR (finally adopted on 24 May 2023). 15 ECJ judgment Akzo Nobel, C-516/15, EU:C:2017:314, p. 48. 16 ECJ judgment Akzo Nobel and Others, C-97/08, EU:C:2009:536, p. 59–61. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 13(16) Date: 2024-12-11 must be enforceable according to the data protection regulation. The European Court of Justice has stated that data controllers may be subject to penalty fees for actions if they cannot are deemed to have been unaware that the conduct constituted a breach, regardless of whether they were aware that they violated the provisions of the data protection regulation. 17 IMY notes that the company, in its capacity as a personal data controller, is responsible for it personal data processing that takes place within the company and for it to take place in accordance with the data protection regulation through the principle of responsibility in article 5.2. IMY has assessed that the company has not complied with the data protection regulation regarding the requirements for legal basis and the information to be provided to data subjects. Against the background of The statement of the European Court of Justice mentioned above and taking into account previous supervisory decisions 18 from IMY and the investigation into the case, it appears that the company cannot be considered to have been unaware that the action could constitute a violation of the data protection regulation. Against this background, IMY believes that the company has been negligent in relation to them violations of the data protection regulation that have been established. There is thus prerequisites for imposing an administrative sanction fee on the company. 3.5.2 Amount of the penalty fee IMY states that Granit Bostad Beritsholm AB according to the latest information available group structure from December 2022 is a wholly owned subsidiary within a group with the parent company Granit Bostad AB (559300–4913). The group includes, in addition to Granit Bostad Beritsholm AB, the following companies. Granit Bostad 1 AB (559304-5825), Granit Bostad Bilen AB (556823-6235), Granit Bostad Bredäng AB (556832-5335), Granit Bostad Forskningen AB (556865-7281), Granit Bostad Sorgenfri AB (556883-2819), Granit Bostad 2 AB (556995-9330), Granit Bostad Annedal AB (556833-4741), Granit Bostad Hjorthagskvarteret AB (556832-5285), Granit Bostad Klippern AB (556833- 4782), Granit Bostad Rosendal AB (556917-7164), Granit Bostad 3 AB (556994-5768), Granit Bostad Bryggvägen AB (556833-4733), Granit Bostad Fyrislundsgatan AB (556879-2716), Granit Bostad Kommendörkaptenen AB (556823-6367), Granit Bostad 4 AB (559318-0846), Granit Bostad Duvan 4 AB (559317-1282), Granit Bostad Duvan AB (556807-4214), Granit Bostad Korpen 4 AB (559317-1274), Granit Bostad Korpen AB (556886-3400), Granit Bostad Lissabon AB (559340-8429), Granit Bostad 5 AB 19 (559381-9708) and Granit Bostad Malmö 5 AB (559395-2350). The parent company's ownership is one hundred percent in the subsidiaries, which in turn own one hundred percent ownership in its subsidiaries. Against the background of what has been reported above, one hundred percent or almost one hundred percent ownership a presumption for control to be considered to exist and that the parent company and the subsidiaries must be taken into account in the calculation. The company has stated that information about the group structure of which the company is a part deviates the following way. Granit Bostad 4 Duvan AB has been merged into Granit Bostad Duvan AB, Granit Bostad 4 Korpen AB has been merged into Granit Bostad Korpen AB and Granit Bostad Malmö 5 AB has been merged into Granit Bostad Beritsholm AB. Two companies have acquired; Granit Bostad Slottstaden AB and Granit Bostad Villandia AB. The company has further stated that the company acquired more properties in 2023, which meant that net sales for 2023 increased to SEK 274,053,000. The company's results had at the same time 17 CJEU judgment Nacionalinis sistemas sistemas centras, C-683/21, EU:C:2023:949, paragraph 81, and judgment Deutsche Wohnen, C-807/21, EU:C:2023:950, p. 76. 18 Supervisory decision DI-2018-14593, BRF Gårdsbjörken, decided on 15 June 2020, supervisory decision DI-2020-4534, Uppsalahem AB, decided on 14 December 2020 and supervisory decision DI-2021-2172, Bergsporten, decided on 18 April 2024 (the two first-mentioned decisions were published at the decision date on the IMY website where they are still available, Bergsporten has appealed to the administrative court and thus has not gained legal force). 19 Group structure, Bisnode Infotorg as of 10 December 2024. Data Protection Authority Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 14(16) Date: 2024-12-11 a strong negative development during the year as a result of rising interest costs and a decrease in value of the property portfolio. The property value decreased by 360,251,000 SEK in 2023, which resulted in a negative net result of minus SEK 318,734,000. With regard to the financial changes that took place during the year, IMY does the following assessment. According to the data protection regulation's provision on calculation of administrative penalty fee, the calculation must be made based on the total global 20 the annual turnover during the previous budget year. The negative net result in 2023 shall therefore not affect the calculation of the penalty fee. IMY thus does not find reason to disregard the provision and the penalty fee must be calculated based on this the total annual turnover. IMY assesses that the annual turnover to be used as a basis for its calculation the administrative sanction fee that Granit Bostad Beritsholm AB can be imposed is all the companies reported above that are part of the group with Granit Bostad AB as parent company. Annual reports for the financial year 2023 for the company show that the total turnover amounts to SEK 274,053,000. 4% of that amount is SEK 10,962,120. Since this amount is lower than EUR 20,000,000 shall the penalty fee is set at an amount between 0 and 20,000,000 EUR. As regards the assessment of the seriousness of the infringements, there is one beginning factors which mean that there are reasons to take the violations more seriously. The personal data processing has intended camera surveillance of residents in direct connection to their homes and visitors to residences. Camera surveillance has been carried out around the clock with a large number of cameras of large parts of the property for a longer period time. The company has guarded entrances and stairwells in the property, which has meant that they residents have been monitored every time they have moved to and from their homes and it has has not been possible to avoid being monitored by cameras. That the people who are met by the monitoring has not received all the information that the company has been obliged to providing has further entailed a risk that the data subject did not become aware of their rights or that they have exercised their rights to a lesser extent than they did have the right to according to the data protection regulation. IMY notes at the same time that the company has shown that there have been some problems with burglary of the garage and has had a legitimate interest as well as taken other measures to come to terms with this, which means that it has not been deliberate violations. IMY also states that the surveillance was limited to the residents and visitors. During the course of the inspection, the company has updated signs camera surveillance and their website with information about camera surveillance and more information than before and have thus attempted to take corrective action to comply the information obligation. In the light of the above circumstances, IMY assesses that, in total, it concerns for violations of a low level of seriousness. The starting point for the calculation of the penalty fee should therefore be set low in relation to the current maximum amount. In addition to assessing the seriousness of the violations, IMY must assess whether they exist any aggravating or mitigating circumstances that become relevant the amount of the penalty fee. IMY assesses that there is no further aggravating factor or 20 Article 83.5 of the data protection regulation. Data protection authority Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 15(16) Date: 2024-12-11 mitigating circumstances, in addition to those taken into account in the assessment of the degree of seriousness above, which affects the amount of the penalty fee. In light of the nature and seriousness of the violations, the IMY decides that it the administrative sanction fee for Granit Bostad Beritsholm AB can stay 200,000 kroner. IMY considers this amount to be effective, proportionate and deterrent in the present case. 3.5.3 Injunction According to Article 58.2 d, the supervisory authority has the authority to issue a personal data controller to ensure that the processing takes place in accordance with the regulations in the data protection regulation and if required in a specific way and within a specific period. Because the surveillance, as far as the investigation shows, is still ongoing, it is urgent that the company ceases the surveillance that is not permitted. It exists therefore reason to, based on Article 58.2 d of the data protection regulation, order the company to cease camera surveillance of all places in the property, with the exception of the garage. According to IMY, it is also important that the company takes measures to ensure that they registrants receive correct and complete information regarding it personal data processing through camera surveillance that takes place. IMY decides with support of article 58.2 d of the data protection regulation that the company must be ordered to, no later than four weeks after this decision takes effect, take steps to ensure that 1. the company ceases the camera surveillance of all places in the property except the garage, 2. there is information about the company's identity on the camera surveillance signs and contact information for the company, in the form of an email address or telephone number. That measures must have been taken no later than four weeks after this decision came into force means that if the decision is not appealed, action must have been taken no later than four weeks after that the appeal period has expired. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This decision has been made by unit manager Jenny Bård after a presentation by the lawyer Khadija Faras.

IMY issues a reprimand to Aller Media AB pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the Data Protection Regulation. Statement of the supervisory case IMY has initiated supervision against Aller Media AB (Aller or the company) for the purpose of investigating a complaint. The complaint is one of several complaints submitted to the European data protection authorities regarding cookies and cookie banners. The complaints mainly concern the design of cookie banners, the placement of cookies and the subsequent processing of personal data after the cookies have been placed on the complainant's browser or device. In order to facilitate cooperation on these complaints, a working group (Cookie Banner Taskforce) was created within the European Data Protection Board (EDPB). Given the cross-border processing involved, IMY has made use of the mechanisms for cooperation and consistency provided for in Chapter VII of the GDPR. The supervisory authorities concerned have been the data protection authorities of Austria, Denmark and Italy. The complainant has stated in essence the following. Aller has not had a legal basis to process the complainant's personal data through the use of cookies on its website recept.se on 21 May 2021. There has been neither a legitimate interest nor a valid consent. By reinforcing in the cookie banner that it is consent that is the legal basis, Postal address: Aller has led data subjects to believe that they do not have a choice to object under Article 6(1). f. It Box 8114 has not been possible to object to the processing in the first layer and there has been no 104 20 Stockholm other easy way to exercise their right to object to the processing. The only option Website: www.imy.se to object has been hidden in the banner. It has also not been possible to refuse cookies in the first layer and the company has thus made it more difficult to refuse the processing of E-mail: imy@imy.se 1 Phone: Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). the free flow of such data and on the repeal of 08-657 61 00Integritysskyddsmyndigheten Filing number: IMY-2023-16452 2(6) Date: 2025-04-28 personal data. The design of the cookie banner has also been misleading through the choice of color, contrast and links, which has meant that it has not been possible to give informed and voluntary consent in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. This also contradicts the principle of transparency and information. Aller has stated the following in essence. At the stated time in 2021, Aller used both legitimate interest and consent as a legal basis, following a recommendation from the company's Consent Management Platform (CMP) provider. This is to meet both the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation and to comply with the recommendations of the industry organization Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB). Legitimate interest was thus retained but the company made adjustments in accordance with the IAB's requirements and an adjustment in the text by explicitly mentioning the requirement for consent in the cookie banner. Aller 's assessment is that at least since 2023, only consent is the legal basis. Aller only has two purposes that are always active and these are necessary cookies and the visitor's privacy choice. The complainant has been given the opportunity to comment on Aller's report and has stated that the parts of the complaint that refer to the possibility of refusing cookies in the first layer, misleading link design, misleading color and contrast on buttons and that it has not been as easy to withdraw as to give consent have been addressed. The complainant has also argued that Aller does not have a legal basis to save information that visitors have not consented and that the company shares this information with other companies. In support of this, the complainant has submitted screenshots from Aller's website from 2024. Scope of the case The Swedish Post and Telecom Agency is the sole competent supervisory authority over the Electronic Communications Act (LEK) (2022:482) which sets out specific requirements for the storage of cookies in terminal equipment or the collection of data from such equipment. The personal data processing that takes place after collection, for example analysis or profiling, is, however, subject to the rules of the Data Protection Regulation where IMY is the competent supervisory authority. Against this background, IMY's review has been limited to the processing of personal data that took place after the data was collected and the shortcomings alleged in the complaint regarding this subsequent processing. During the handling of the case, the complainant has stated that the parts regarding the possibility of refusing in the first layer, misleading link design, misleading color and contrast on buttons and that it was not as easy to withdraw as to give consent have now been addressed. IMY therefore sees no reason to investigate this further. IMY's review concerns the question of whether Aller had a lawful basis to process the complainant's personal data through the use of cookies on its website on 21 May 2021. In connection with the statement on Aller's report, the complainant has raised new objections to Aller's personal data processing concerning the design of the cookie banner in 2024. IMY considers that the complaint has been investigated to an appropriate extent without being extended to also include these issues and will therefore not take a position on these in the case.Integrity Protection Authority Case number: IMY-2023-16452 3(6) Date: 2025-04-28 Reasoning for the decision Applicable provisions, etc. According to the principle of accountability, the controller must be able to demonstrate that the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with the data protection provisions. 2 Processing of personal data is only lawful if one of the conditions set out in Article 6 of the GDPR is met. Legitimate interest pursuant to 6(1)(f) is one of the lawful grounds that may support the processing of personal data. In order for processing to be based on a balancing of interests (also referred to as a legitimate interest) pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, three conditions must be met. Firstly, the controller or a third party must have a legitimate interest. Secondly, the processing must be necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interest. Thirdly, the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects must not override the legitimate interests (balancing of interests). 3 Recital 47 states that a legitimate interest may exist, for example, where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller, such as the data subject being a customer of or working for the controller. A legitimate interest in any case requires a careful assessment, including whether the data subject can reasonably expect, at the time of and in connection with the collection of the personal data, that the data will be processed for that purpose. In particular, the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could outweigh the interests of the controller if the personal data are processed in circumstances where the data subject cannot reasonably expect any further processing. The EDPB’s guidelines on the processing of personal data based on Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR state that three criteria must be met for a 4 legitimate interest to be considered to exist. The interest must be lawful, which means that it must not conflict with either EU or national law. The fact that an interest is commercial does not exclude that the interest is legitimate, but the decisive factor for this assessment is whether the interest is lawful, specific and constitutes a real and actual interest. Furthermore, the interest must be clearly and distinctly formulated and relate to a real interest that exists at the time of the processing and is not hypothetical. 6 Assessment The question in the case is whether Aller was able to support the processing of the complainant’s personal data on 21 May 2021 on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. 2 Articles 5(2) and 24 of the GDPR. 3 See the judgments of the European Court of Justice of 4 May 2017, Rīgas satiksme, C‑13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph 28, of 11 December 2019, Asociaţia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA, C-708/18, EU:C:2019:1064, paragraph 40, of 17 June 2021, M.I.C.M., C-597/19, EU:C:2020:1063, paragraph 106 and of 4 July 2023, Meta Platforms and others, C-252/21, 4U:C:2023:537, paragraph 106. 5 See EDPB's Guidelines 1/2024 on processing of personal data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, version 1.0, paragraph 17. See See judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 4 October 2024, Koninklijke Nederlandse Lawn Tennisbond, C-621/22, EU:C:2024:857, paragraph 49 6 See judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 4 October 2024, Koninklijke Nederlandse Lawn Tennisbond, C-621/22, EU:C:2024:857, paragraph 49 6 See judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 708/18, paragraph 44.Dutch Data Protection Authority Case number: IMY-2023-16452 4(6) Date: 2025-04-28 Aller provides information about the use of cookies on the website in a so-called cookie banner which is displayed, among other things, when the user first accesses the website. In the first layer of the cookie banner, as it appeared at the time of the complaint, there was a button to consent and a link to display the purposes. The information text in the first layer stated that one could consent or manage their choices, including the right to object where legitimate interest is used. The possibility to object was not present in the first layer of the banner. It was further stated that the company processes data to offer the use of precise geodata, create personalized advertising and create a personal profile. In order to be able to refuse all types of processing, a data subject first had to refuse consent and then go ahead and find the option to object to processing for certain purposes. The assessment below is based on this cookie banner and the company's then website. Aller has stated in its cookie banner that the company has a legitimate interest in processing data for profiling and precise geodata. In its communication with IMY, the company has not argued that it actually had a legitimate interest in processing the data. Aller has instead referred to the fact that its CMP supplier has recommended the company to have both consent and legitimate interest as the legal basis for this type of personal data processing. Taking into account the liability in the Data Protection Regulation, IMY does not believe that a data controller can waive its responsibility to ensure that there is a legal basis for the company's personal data processing by referring to a supplier's recommendations. IMY therefore notes that Aller is responsible for ensuring that there is a legal basis for the processing of personal data by the company. IMY believes that the requirement for consent to collect data via cookies provides a particularly strong privacy protection and gives data subjects the opportunity to choose and control how their personal data is used. If the collected data is further processed at a later stage with legitimate interest as the legal basis, this particular privacy protection risks being eroded. This special privacy protection for the data subject is therefore something that should be taken into account in a balancing of interests pursuant to Article 6(1)(f). During IMY's investigation of the case, Aller has not clearly stated what their legitimate interest in the personal data processing in question was or how a balancing of interests should have been carried out. IMY's assessment is that the complainant cannot be considered to have been able to expect such personal data processing solely by visiting Aller's website. Furthermore, the complainant has only been able to object to processing only after having refused consent in the cookie banner. Against this background, IMY's assessment is that Aller has not shown that the company was able to support the personal data processing on the legal basis of legitimate interest. In summary, Aller has violated Article 6(1)(f) of the Data Protection Regulation by processing the complainant's personal data without a legal basis. Choice of intervention It is clear from Article 58(2) and Article 83(2) of the Data Protection Regulation that the IMY has the power to impose administrative sanctions in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, administrative sanctions 7Article 5(3) Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) and Chapter 9, Section 28 of the Electronic Communications Act (2022:482).Integrity Protection Authority Case number: IMY-2023-16452 5(6) Date: 2025-04-28 fees shall be imposed in addition to or instead of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2), such as for example injunctions and prohibitions. Article 83(2) also states which factors shall be taken into account when deciding whether to impose administrative penalty fees and when determining the amount of the fee. If the infringement is minor, IMY may, as stated in recital 148, issue a reprimand in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) instead of imposing a penalty fee. Consideration shall be given to aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the case, such as the nature, severity and duration of the infringement and previous infringements of relevance. IMY notes the following relevant circumstances. The current supervision includes an examination of whether Aller had a lawful basis for processing an individual complainant's personal data. IMY has assessed that the company did not have a lawful basis for processing the complainant's personal data. Aller has made certain changes to its cookie banner after IMY initiated supervision and now states that they have consent as a lawful basis. The company has not previously been found to have violated the Data Protection Regulation. In a balanced assessment, IMY considers that this is a minor violation within the meaning of recital 148 of the Data Protection Regulation, which entails that Aller Media AB should be given a reprimand in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) of the Data Protection Regulation for the violation found. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This decision has been made by the Head of Unit Albin Brunskog after a presentation by the lawyer Michaela Prieto Ceric Albin Brunskog Appendix The complainant's personal data Copy to The Data Protection OfficerIntegrity Protection Authority Case number: IMY-2023-16452 6(6) Date: 2025-04-28 How to appeal If you wish to appeal the decision, you should write to IMY.

Only the Swedish version is authentic. COMPLAINANT See appendix CONTROLLER Aktiebolaget trav och galopp Final decision under the General Data Protection Regulation – Aktiebolaget Trav och Galopp Decision of the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) finds that Aktiebolaget Trav och Galopp (ATG, 556180-4161) has processed the complainant’s personal data in breach of Article 6 and 7(3) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 1 by not making it as easy to withdraw as to give consent, and making it more difficult for the complainant to give an informed and freely given consent, by using a misleading design of its cookie banner. IMY issues a reprimand to ATG pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR for the infringements. Presentation of the supervisory case IMY has initiated supervision regarding ATG due to a complaint. The complaint is one of several complaints filed with the European Data Protection Authorities regarding cookies and cookie banners. The complaints mainly concern the design of cookie banners, the placement of cookies and the subsequent processing of personal data after the cookies have been placed on the complainant's browser or device. To facilitate cooperation on these complaints, a ‘Cookie Banner Taskforce’ was created within the European Data Protection Board. In view of the cross-border nature of the processing, IMY has made use of the cooperation and consistency mechanisms provided for in Chapter VII of the GDPR. The supervisory authority concerned has been the Austrian Data Protection Authority. The complainant has essentially stated the following. On 21 May 2021, ATG processed the complainant’s personal data in breach of the GDPR because there was no valid consent. Nor has it been possible to refuse cookies in the first layer and the company has thus made it more difficult to refuse the 1 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). Swedish ref.: IMY-2023-16453 Austrian ref: D130.865 IMI case register: 372595 Date: 2024-12-19 Our ref.: IMY-2023-16453 2(6)Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection Date: 2024-12-19 processing of personal data. The design of the cookie banner has through colour selection, contrast and links also been misleading, which means that it has not been possible to give an informed and freely given consent in accordance with the GDPR. This is also contrary to the principle of transparency and information. In addition, it has not been as easy to withdraw consent as it has been to give consent. ATG’s information that cookies are used on the website (in a so-called cookie banner) has been attached to the complaint. ATG has essentially stated the following. On 21 May 2021, ATG had consent as the legal basis for the processing. It was possible to refuse cookies and this could be done in the second layer. It was also possible to withdraw the consent. Information about the right to withdraw consent was provided in the second layer. The consent was withdrawn via ATG's cookie policy under the heading ""How do I manage the acceptance/rejection of cookies?"". There were some shortcomings in the consent on 21 May 2021, therefore the following were addressed in October 2021. ATG introduced a clear button to refuse cookies instead of a link. Furthermore, the colour and contrast of the buttons were changed. No cookies other than necessary cookies were placed in the visitor's browser before the visitor made an active consent to cookies. ATG has attached pictures of the changes to the cookie banner. The complainant has been given the opportunity to comment on ATG’s statement and has withdrawn the parts concerning the possibility to refuse cookies in the first layer and misleading link design. ATG has been given the opportunity to comment on the draft decision. The scope of the case The Swedish Post and Telecom Authority is the sole competent supervisory authority over the Electronic Communications Act (2022:482), which contains specific requirements for the storage of cookies in terminal equipment or the collection of data from such equipment. However, the personal data processing that takes place after collection, such as analysis or profiling, is subject to the provisions of the GDPR, where IMY is the competent supervisory authority. Against that background, IMY’s investigation has been limited to the processing of personal data that took place after the data was collected and the deficiencies stated in the complaint relating to that subsequent processing. During the handling of the case, the complainant has stated that the parts regarding no possibility to refuse cookies and that ATG makes it difficult for the complainant to withdraw or refuse consent through the use of a misleading link, have now been remedied. IMY also notes that ATG has changed its cookie banner and that there is now a way to refuse cookies in the first layer and that a button is used instead of a link to refuse cookies. IMY therefore finds no reason to investigate this further. Our ref.: IMY-2023-16453 3(6)Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection Date: 2024-12-19 Motivation for the decision Applicable provisions, etc. Processing of personal data is only lawful if one of the conditions set out in Article 6 of the GDPR is met. The legal basis in question in the case is consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a). Consent is defined in Article 4(11) of the GDPR as any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. For consent to be valid, all of these requirements must be met. Freely given and informed consent The transparency of the processing of personal data towards the data subject follows from the principle of transparency set out in Article 5(1) of the Regulation. It is in the light of that principle the requirement that consent must be informed should be read. Recital 42 of the GDPR states that consent should not be regarded as freely given where the data subject has no genuine or free choice or cannot easily refuse or withdraw his or her consent. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) guidelines on consent state that there should be a genuine choice and control for data subjects. As a general rule, the GDPR provides that if the data subject has no real choice, feels compelled to consent or will suffer adverse consequences if they do not consent, the consent will not be valid. The guidelines also state that data controllers must design consent solutions that are clear to data subjects. 2 The EDPB further considers that the use of a small font size or a colour that does not contrast sufficiently to provide sufficient readability (e.g. slightly grey text colour on a white background) may have a negative impact on users, as the text becomes less visible and users either overlook it or have difficulty reading it. 3 Withdraw consent Article 7(3) of the GDPR provides that, in order for consent to be valid, the data subject must have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. Before consent is given, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It should be as easy to withdraw as it is to give consent. The EDPB Guidelines on consent state that consent does not have to be given and withdrawn in the exact same action, but should be as simple. In practice, when consent is given electronically by a single mouse click, swipe or keystroke, data subjects must be able to withdraw consent just as easily. Where consent is obtained through a service-specific user interface (e.g. via a website or an app), the data subject must undoubtedly be able to withdraw consent via the same electronic interface, as switching to another interface for the sole purpose of withdrawing consent would require an unjustified effort. In addition, the data subject should be able to 2 EDPB Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, version 1.1, adopted on 4 May 2020, paragraphs 13 and 84. 3 EDPB Guidelines 03/2022 on misleading design patterns in social media platform interfaces: how to recognise and avoid them, Version 2.0, adopted on 14 February 2023 May, paragraphs 51 and 84. Our ref.: IMY-2023-16453 4(6)Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection Date: 2024-12-19 withdraw the consent without difficulty. This means, among other things, that a controller must ensure that it does not cost anything to withdraw consent or that the service is impaired. 4 The question in the case is whether there was a valid consent to process the complainant's personal data via cookies. Assessment ATG provides information that cookies are used on the website in a so-called cookie banner. The banner is displayed, inter alia, when the user first enters the website. In the first layer of the cookie banner, as it appeared on 21 May 2021, there were two options to choose from for the data subject, ‘Select your cookies’ and ‘Accept all cookies’. The following assessment is based on this cookie banner on the company's website. Comparison of consent and withdrawal procedures The complainant highlights the option of having a permanently hovering icon visible on all pages of the website to withdraw consent. IMY considers that a permanent hovering icon is an option that can meet the condition that it should be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. On the other hand, IMY does not consider that the GDPR requires a specific technical solution that all controllers must use in order to comply with the requirement of Article 7(3). The assessment of whether it is as easy to withdraw as it is to give consent needs to be made in the individual case on the basis of the procedure in question used to give consent. This assessment is in line with the Cookie Banner taskforce report and the EDPB opinion on valid consent. 5 During the relevant period, when a user visited ATG’s website for the first time, the cookie banner appeared immediately. The title of ATG’s cookie banner was ‘Accept cookies’. There, the user could, at the click of a button, consent to the use of all (non- essential) cookies. Once a user had given their consent in the cookie banner, the cookie banner disappeared and the website could be used. In order to withdraw consent, the data subject had to go to the company’s cookie policy, which was located in the footer under the heading ‘Personal data’. There you had to click on the ""Cookies"" button and then on the ""How do I manage the acceptance/rejection of cookies?"" button. Information about accepting/denying cookies came up and at the bottom was the option ‘click here to open the cookie-settings’. There, the data subject had to click again and then enter a settings center where he or she had to uncheck the categories of cookies to which he or she had previously consented and then press ‘save settings’. Thus, when comparing the way consent was obtained on the website, much fewer keystrokes were needed to give consent than to withdraw consent. IMY further considers that it was difficult for a data subject to find where to withdraw consent at all. Since 21 May 2021, ATG has implemented changes to its cookie banner. Among other things, ATG has added clarification headings on withdrawal under the button ‘how do I manage the acceptance/rejection of cookies?’ in the cookie policy. However, the data subject still needs to go through all the steps described above in order to withdraw. 4 EDPB Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, version 1.1, adopted on 4 May 2020, paragraphs 113-114. 5 Report on the work of the EDPB Working Group, ‘Cookie Banner Taskforce’, adopted on 17 January 2023, para. 35 and Opinion 08/2024 on valid consents for “Consent or Pay Models” implemented by large online platforms, adopted on 17 April 2024, paragraph 169 (IMY translation). Our ref.: IMY-2023-16453 5(6)Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection Date: 2024-12-19 IMY's assessment is therefore that the changes made have not led to a data subject being able to withdraw his or her consent as easily as giving consent. Misleading design IMY does not consider it possible to introduce a general standard regarding the colours and contrasts that a data controller should use in its cookie banner. An assessment of a cookie banner and whether it complies with the GDPR needs to be made on a case-by-case basis. The assessment shall consider whether contrast and colour are clearly misleading for the data subject and do not result in unintentional and therefore invalid consent. This assessment is in line with the Cookie Banner taskforce report. 6 IMY does not consider that the option to refuse and to accept cookies needs to look exactly the same in order to comply with the GDPR's provisions on consent. However, they must be equivalent in order for the data subject not to be misled in their choice. During the period in question, ATG used two different colours for the ‘Select your cookies’ and ‘Accept all cookies’ options. For the option not to accept cookies a link was used and for accepting cookies a button was used. The link consisted of grey/black text and the button to approve was green with white text. The background of the banner was white. The option of not accepting cookies, i.e. the link, is therefore not perceived as prominent as a green button on a white background. Furthermore, it is not clear that the link constitutes a possible choice for a user. It seems more like information because the text ""Choose your cookies"" is designed in the same way as the general information about cookies in the banner. IMY therefore considers that the design of the cookie banner reinforced the perception that the user should click to accept cookies. This must also be seen in the light of the fact that the cookie banner had the heading ‘Accept cookies’. IMY considers that ATG's design of the cookie banner and the choice of colours and contrasts were designed to encourage the data subject to accept cookies. ATG has stated that the company needs to comply with regulations to improve accessibility. IMY does not consider that this justifies the need for the company to highlight the option of accepting cookies. IMY’s assessment is that the complainant’s consent cannot have been an expression of its unambiguous wish, since the design made it appear that there were no other options than to consent. The complainant cannot therefore have been considered to have had the opportunity to give an informed and freely given consent. ATG has changed the design of its cookie banner after the complaint. IMY considers that these changes brought some improvements for the data subject to provide freely given and informed consent. However, IMY believes that despite the changes, the design makes the option to accept all cookies more prominent than refusing. This is because the option to accept cookies still has a stronger contrast to the background than the option to refuse cookies. Against that background, IMY considers that ATG used misleading design in its choice of colour and contrast in its cookie banner, which affects the complainant’s ability to give an informed and freely given consent. Summary ATG has not made it as easy to withdraw consent as to give it. In addition, the company has used misleading designs in its choice of colour and contrast in the cookie banner, which affected the complainant’s ability to give an informed and freely 6 Report on the work of the Cookie Banner Taskforce, adopted on 17 January 2023, para. 17. Our ref.: IMY-2023-16453 6(6)Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection Date: 2024-12-19 given consent. There was therefore no valid consent and consequently no legal basis for processing the complainant’s personal data. ATG therefore processed the complainant’s personal data in breach of Article 6 and Article 7(3) of the GDPR. Choice of corrective measure Pursuant to Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83(2) of the GDPR, IMY has the power to impose administrative fines in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the circumstances of the case, administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or instead of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2), such as injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83(2) determines the factors to be considered when imposing administrative fines and when determining the amount of the fine. In the case of a minor infringement, IMY may, as stated in recital 148, instead of imposing a fine, issue a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b). Aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case need to be taken into consideration. These could include the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement as well as past infringements of relevance. IMY notes the following relevant facts. IMY has assessed that the company has not had a legal basis to process the complainants' personal data. Although ATG is not considered to have made the withdrawal as easy as the giving of consent, there has been an opportunity to withdraw consent and the company has made some improvements after the complaint to make it easier for the data subject. ATG has also made some improvements to the design of the cookie banner, although these have been considered insufficient. The company has not previously been found to have infringed the GDPR. Against this background, IMY considers these minor infringements within the meaning of recital 148 and that ATG is to be given a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR.

The Privacy Protection Authority decides on the basis of ch. Section 2 of the Data Protection Act and 2 Articles 58 (2) and 83 of the Data Protection Ordinance to the Executive Board of the Emergency Services Östra Skaraborg must pay an administrative sanction fee of 350,000 (three hundred and fifty thousand) kronor, of which 300,000 (three hundred thousand) kronor refers infringements of Article 5 (1) (a) and 5.1 c and SEK 50,000 (fifty thousand) infringements of Article 32 (1) and Article 32 (4) of the Data Protection Regulation. Report on the supervisory matter The Privacy Protection Agency (IMY) has received complaints alleging that The Executive Board of the Rescue Service Östra Skaraborg (Rescue Service) conducts camera surveillance in the fire station's car park with space for replacement in the event of an alarm and has initiated supervision of the Rescue Service. The inspection has been initiated for the purpose of reviewing the Rescue Service's personal data processing in the form of camera surveillance has taken place in accordance with the principles of legality and regularity set out in Article 5 (1) (a) of the Data Protection Regulation; the principle of data minimization in Article 5 (1) (c), the legal basis requirement in Article 6 and the requirements for organizational security in Article 32. When reviewing the processing of personal data in the form of camera surveillance of the carriage halls have mainly emerged the following. Camera surveillance has been conducted from March – April 2015 until 6 May 2021 stations in Skövde, Mariestad, Hjo, Tibro, Karlsborg, Hova, Gullspång and Töreboda. A camera has been mounted on each station. All cameras have been placed in carriages at the fire stations and has guarded a space used as garage for rescue vehicles. The staff hall also stores the staff's emergency clothing, REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and on repeal of Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Regulation). 2 Act (2018: 218) with supplementary provisions to the EU Data Protection Regulation. Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2018-22697 3 (17) Date: 2021-06-09 alarm stand, which must be able to be put on quickly before expression in the event of an alarm. For other types of exchanges there are special changing rooms that are not monitored by cameras. The camera surveillance of the car parks has been conducted around the clock in real time without image recording. The cameras have been movably mounted and have shown a number of views accordingly a predetermined movement pattern. The cameras have also been able to be controlled manually and have optics that can zoom. The film material has been examined in real time by internal officers from the command center in Skövde when alarm has been activated at a fire station. The control center that the cameras are connected to staff in emergency situations. Examination of what was captured by the camera's shooting range has only occurred in these situations. Sound has been able recorded in real time after the internal commander has activated a microphone to be able to talk with the intrusive force. A light has been lit in the car park when the microphone has been on activated. The camera-monitored fire stations are staffed by staff who are as well full-time employee (Skövde and Mariestad) as a part-time employee (all audited stations). When part-time staff move in, firefighters should normally be within five minutes from the alarm goes off, switch left the fire station in a vehicle. Then shall the firefighters have gone to the fire station, often in a private car, changed and ha placed in the correct vehicle. Full-time staff are usually at the fire station when alarms go and change from station uniform. Firefighters are on it guarded the place in the carriage hall for about a minute. The complaint has stated that it has happened to intruding staff in the event of an alarm in the middle of the night has arrived at the fire station in a bathrobe with underwear or nothing at all underneath, which has meant that staff have been camera-monitored naked or only in underwear when changing to an alarm stand. The rescue service has in an opinion received on 31 May 2021 stated that it does not occur at all that rescue personnel on standby arrive at the respective station in the event of an alarm only wearing bathrobe with only underwear or nothing at all underneath. Opinion received on 22 May 2019, it is stated that no employee will be staying in the Rescue Service's premises naked, except in changing rooms intended for this, as it can be experienced as troublesome and offensive to other employees. Furthermore, it has been stated that the alarm place is designed as such that its function is maintained regardless of whether the employee chooses to dress only in alarm stand or chooses to have undergarments under the alarm stand. The employees who choose to do not use e.g. underwear can choose to only wear underwear underneath the alarm place and will thus in such cases only wear underwear under one shorter time when dressing and undressing the alarm place. Furthermore, it has emerged that the employees at one of the fire stations protested against the camera surveillance in connection with the introduction in 2015 by covering for some of the surface where alarm places hang with a cardboard board. The rescue service has in the opinion which came in on May 22, 2019, with completion on May 28, 2019, stated that the cardboard board was removed after collaboration with a local union representative after a burglary. At collaboration with employee organizations in 2015, views emerged as among another argued that camera surveillance should not include a place where replacement takes place, that it would be an advantage to activate the camera only in the event of an alarm, that it was perceived as offensive to be monitored and that the information about the camera surveillance has been broken. Infront of collaboration in August 2015, it was stated that the employer's focus was that measures would taken so that areas where staff change could not be monitored by cameras. At the collaboration meeting was decided to ensure that each station would be adapted so that the Privacy Protection Agency Record number: DI-2018-22697 4 (17) Date: 2021-06-09 camera surveillance of changing rooms would not take place. The rescue service has stated that since August 2015 there have been no complaints against the camera surveillance or that the issue is raised on collaboration again. As for the information about the camera surveillance that is provided The rescue service stated that it is now on the checklist at the time of introduction that inform new employees about the camera surveillance, that a written information has been taken to ensure this information and that it is signposted on the premises camera surveillance. To its final opinion in May 2021, the rescue service attached a decision made on 6 May 2021 where it appears that the camera surveillance that is examined will end with immediate effect. Furthermore, the need for camera surveillance must be reassessed accordingly that the IMY has made a decision in the current case. Grounds for the decision Personal data manager The Executive Board of the Rescue Service Östra Skaraborg is stated to be personal data manager for the Rescue Service's personal data processing. IMY shares this view. The time for the trial The audited camera surveillance has been going on from March-April 2015 until 6 May 2021. When the Data Protection Ordinance first came into force on 25 May 2018, IMY's review, which takes place on the basis of the said regulation, limited to circumstances that have existed during the period thereafter. Circumstances in connection with the introduction of The camera surveillance in 2015 is thus outside the IMY's supervision. Rules for the Rescue Service's camera surveillance Camera surveillance is a form of personal data processing. How and in which to the extent that it is permitted to camera surveillance in the case in question is regulated in the Data Protection Ordinance and the Camera Surveillance Act (2018: 1200) which supplement the Data Protection Regulation. The Camera Surveillance Act Section 4 of the Camera Surveillance Act states that the Act applies to camera surveillance in accordance with section 3. takes place with equipment located in Sweden. Of § 3 point 1 of the Camera Surveillance Act It appears that camera surveillance includes a television camera, another optical-electronic instruments or comparable equipment, without being operated on site used in such a way as to involve permanent or regular repetition personal surveillance. The camera surveillance that the Rescue Service has conducted has not maneuvered on site and has involved a permanent monitoring of the employees as well other visitors. The Camera Surveillance Act therefore applies to the Rescue Service coverage. The Camera Surveillance Act contains provisions on when a permit is required to camera surveillance. It follows from section 7 of the Camera Surveillance Act that a permit is required for surveillance of a place to which the public has access if the surveillance is carried out by an authority or someone other than an authority when performing a task of general interest as the Privacy Protection Authority Record number: DI-2018-22697 5 (17) Date: 2021-06-09 follows from law or other statute, collective agreement or decision issued with support by law or other statute. The rescue service Östra Skaraborg is a municipal association and thus one authority, and is basically subject to a permit for camera surveillance. The question is then if the public is considered to have access to the place provided by the Rescue Service camera guards. Practice shows that the concept of ""place to which the public has access"" shall be interpreted broadly (see the Supreme Administrative Court's decision RÅ 2000 ref. 52). Many workplaces are, however, considered to be a place to which the public does not have access (Bill. 2017/18: 23 p.22). In the light of what has emerged about the location of the surveillance, IMY assesses that it is not a question of a place to which the public has access. Some requirement to apply permission does not exist. However, the fact that the camera surveillance is unlicensed does not mean that surveillance is allowed. In addition to the provision on permits, there are other rules in the Camera Surveillance Act, e.g. on the obligation of professional secrecy regarding the recorded material, obligation to negotiate with workers' organizations and information requirements, which may be relevant to follow during camera surveillance. In addition, the rules in the Data Protection Regulation. Data Protection Regulation According to Article 2 (1), the Data Protection Regulation shall apply, inter alia, to the processing of personal data in a completely automatic way. Of Article 4 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation it appears that any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person is a personal information. According to Article 4 (2), ""treatment"" means a measure concerning: personal data, such as collection, registration, reading and deletion. About one surveillance camera captures an identifiable person or other personal data in image, the rules in the Data Protection Regulation must therefore be followed. Since The rescue service has filmed, and recorded sounds from, identifiable people with theirs cameras apply to the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Protection Regulation contains a large number of rules that must be followed Processing of personal data. Within the framework of this supervisory matter is the IMY's review limited to whether the Rescue Service has a legal basis under Article 6 i the Data Protection Ordinance to conduct the current camera surveillance, if The rescue service has lived up to the basic principles of treatment of personal data in Article 5 (1) (a) on legality and regularity and in Article 5 (1) (c) on data minimization, and whether the Rescue Service has met the requirements for security in Article 32 by taking appropriate organizational measures. Is the Rescue Service's camera surveillance allowed according to the Data Protection Regulation? Legal basis for the processing of personal data (Article 6) Article 6 of the Data Protection Regulation states that processing is only legal if at least one of the conditions set out in the article is met, that is, there is a legal basis for the treatment. The processing is necessary to perform a task of general interest, 6.1 e The rescue service has stated that the legal basis for the surveillance is that the surveillance is necessary to perform a task of general interest under Article 6.1 e in the Data Protection Ordinance. Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2018-22697 6 (17) Date: 2021-06-09 Of the preparatory work for a law (2018: 218) with supplementary provisions to the EU The Data Protection Ordinance (hereinafter the Data Protection Act) states the following in Bill. 2017/18: 105 (p. 60). In order for the processing of personal data to be permitted according to the article 6.1 e of the Data Protection Regulation requires the purpose of the processing is necessary to perform the task. This is according to the government assessment is not interpreted as meaning that the task must be of general interest delimited so that it can only be performed in one way. The method as it personal data controller chooses to perform his task must, however - like all public administration - be efficient, effective and proportionate and must therefore not unnecessarily infringe individuals' privacy. The more detailed a particular task has been regulated, the more there should be less space for the person responsible for personal data to choose different approaches. This in turn leads to a larger predictability in terms of what personal data processing can updated. If an assignment has instead been settled on one more overall and results-oriented level, it can probably be performed at many different ways, which in relation to each other can be more or less necessary within the meaning of the Data Protection Regulation. In addition, pursuant to Article 6 (3), treatment pursuant to Article 6 (1) (e) shall be determined in accordance with with Union law or the national law of a Member State. The rescue service's activities are regulated nationally in the Act (2003: 778) on protection against accidents. By rescue service is meant according to ch. § 2 the rescue efforts by the state or the municipalities shall be responsible for in the event of accidents and imminent danger of accidents, for to prevent and limit damage to people, property or the environment. Of ch. § 3 states that the rescue service must be planned and organized so that the rescue efforts can be started within an acceptable time and implemented in an efficient manner. Although detailed provisions for how the Rescue Service is to process personal data missing, the regulation needs to be specific enough to be used as a basis for the assessment of legal basis in Article 6 of the Data Protection Regulation. That the legislation is overall can provide a greater opportunity for the Rescue Service to choose how their assignments must be carried out than if the regulation had been more specific. The rescue service has stated that the purposes that have been established for the surveillance are following. - To facilitate leadership and efficiency during a rescue operation - To facilitate the presence control of firefighters who step in after alarms - To facilitate vehicle selection - To make it possible to ensure that the force leader feels good and can handle the task To secure the shell protection and - To assess the correctness of any alarm connected to the key cabinets on the stations IMY assesses that the purposes can be divided into two categories. The initial four the purposes are intended to enable work management and efficiency in the event of an alarm situation. The the latter two purposes relate to physical security at the fire station.Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten Record number: DI-2018-22697 7 (17) Date: 2021-06-09 The rescue service has stated that the camera surveillance at all fire stations except at Tibro station with automatic has also taken place of the space there the expression clothes are stored. This means that at other fire stations have the surveillance includes the place where the staff changes to alarm stands. The reason for the camera at Tibro station has not monitored the place for replacement in case of alarm is one incorrect programming which has meant that the camera's movement pattern has not covered the location for replacement, if the camera has not been manually controlled to monitor it. According to However, the rescue service has intended to remedy this so that also the camera surveillance at Tibro station would include a place for replacement. Compared to those stations where the place for replacement has been guarded, the Rescue Service has stated that it is on Tibro station has been worse conditions for the management capacity and efficiency at emergency. It has been more difficult to ensure attendance control and to ensure that the force leader feels good in the event of an alarm. Through camera surveillance, the purposes can the surveillance relating to the alarm situation is achieved at the same time as the staff ready to go on alarm, that is, the working method is cost and execution efficient. IMY's assessment - legal basis IMY states that the camera surveillance conducted by the Rescue Service refers to monitoring of employees at their workplace where the staff must be under working hours. The registered are in a position of dependence and are guarded in their everyday environment. The monitoring has involved round-the-clock monitoring in real time and the catchment area has also included space for replacement. There is information that it has happened that employees for efficiency reasons during the change have stayed on the exchange site completely without clothes, which, however, has been rejected by the Rescue Service. Both the scope of surveillance and what is captured by the cameras has increased the intrusion of the individual. The camera surveillance, which among other things has included the employees in underwear, means that the Rescue Service has camera-monitored the employees in privacy-sensitive situations. The processing, however, has not included specific categories of personal data, so sensitive personal data, in accordance with Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation. The national law which, in accordance with Article 6 (3), is to lay down the legal basis therefore need not be more precise than in the law on protection against accidents, but can be generally held. In the light of the above and with regard to the Rescue Service's special assignments and requirements for efficiency, IMY makes the assessment that the treatment has been necessary to perform a task of general interest and that the Rescue Service has had a legal basis in accordance with Article 6 (1) (e) of the Data Protection Regulation for the person in question the treatment. The question then becomes whether the current treatment has lived up to some of them basic principles for the processing of personal data in Article 5. Basic principles for the processing of personal data (Article 5) Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation contains a number of basic principles such as that personal data controllers must take into account when processing personal data. It follows from Article 5 (1) (a), inter alia, that all personal data processing, in addition to being legal, must also be correct (the principles of legality and correctness). By article 5.1 c follows that personal data that is processed must be adequate, relevant and not the Privacy Protection Agency Record number: DI-2018-22697 8 (17) Date: 2021-06-09 too extensive in relation to the purposes for which they are dealt with (the principle of task minimization). Finally, it follows from Article 5 (2) that the personal data controller shall be responsible for and be able to demonstrate compliance with the principles set out in Article 5 (1) (the principle of liability). Principles of legality and regularity (Article 5 (1) (a)) The fact that the processing must be lawful means that there must be a legal basis in Article 6. IMY has assessed above that the Rescue Service fulfills the requirement of a legal basis in Article 6 (1) (e), task of general interest. The treatment is therefore judged to be compatible with the principle on legality in Article 5 (1) (a). With regard to the treatment being correct, the following is stated in the preparatory work for the Data Protection Act (Bill 2017/18: 105 p. 47). As far as the principle of correctness is concerned, in a comparison with other language versions are questioned about the Swedish term correctly corresponds to the purpose of the provision. In the Danish language version states instead that the data should be processed reasonably. On the equivalent way is used in the English language version the term fairly, which means fair, reasonable or reasonable. In the French language version the term loyale is used, which has the same meaning as English fairly. In the German language version, the term Treu is used und Glauben, which is usually translated as good faith or faith and honor. All these terms indicate, in the Government's opinion, more clearly than that Swedish term correctly, that a balance of interests must be struck. In it In the individual case, it can thus e.g. be incompatible with the principle of correctness to take a particular treatment measure, even if this in and for could be considered legally established under Article 6, namely if the processing is unreasonable in relation to the data subject. The legislator has stated here that even if there is a legal basis, it should at a assessment of whether the treatment lives up to the principle of correctness is still made one balancing of interests to determine whether the treatment is unreasonable in relation to it registered, in this case the employees. In the statement received on 22 May 2019, the rescue service stated that it did not there are some other, less privacy violating solutions to do the same thing without that the rescue effort is negatively affected. However, it has also been stated that it is not it is necessary for camera surveillance to take place around the clock to conduct rescue services, but that it only needs to happen in the event of an alarm to the current station. Furthermore, the Rescue Service has stated that the cameras are technically connected to the application they are shown on a daily basis around. To the balance of interests that the legislator believes should be made in an examination of the principle of correctness lacks further guidance. European Data Protection Board, EDPB, however, has in EU guidelines on built-in data protection and data protection as standard stated that, inter alia, the following circumstances shall be taken into account in the examination of whether 3 the principle of correctness is complied with. It states, for example, that the treatment should comply with the reasonable expectations of the data subjects. Furthermore, the balance of power should 3EDPB Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25, Built-in data protection and data protection as standard, version 2.0, p. 18 et seq. Date: 2021-06-09 be a central goal for the relationship between the personal data controller and the registered. The data controller must also respect the data subjects fundamental rights and take appropriate measures and safeguards. The The person responsible for personal data must also ensure the impact of the processing on the individual rights and dignity. IMY's assessment - the principle of correctness Regarding the balance of interests to be made, IMY makes the following assessment of the different interests. IMY initially states that the Rescue Service through the law on protection against Accidents have a requirement for their business that it must be conducted efficiently with regard to both time and execution, to prevent and limit damage in the event of accidents and danger of accidents people, property or environment. The rescue service has stated that, among other things, they are prepared for people which end up in distress at sea and other life-threatening situations, toxic substances released into nature, traffic accidents, fires that occur in buildings and terrain as well as people and property threatened by extreme weather. It is not uncommon for life to be endangered by them events The rescue service is alerted and then both seconds and minutes can make a difference. The purpose of the Rescue Service's camera surveillance, which is now being examined, is described in detail above and can be summarized to enable workflow and alarm efficiency respectively to ensure the physical safety of the fire station. The rescue service has stated that there are no other less privacy-sensitive ways to achieve the same efficiency. At Tibro fire station, where surveillance of place for replacement has not taken place automatically, the conditions for conductivity and emergency response has been worse compared to other stations. The staff do not stay at the station for more than the time they put on the alarm stand, which means that if communication with them is to take place without delaying the rescue operation, it must it takes place at the same time as the exchange takes place. Overall, IMY assesses that the Rescue Service's need for camera surveillance is on the place weighs heavily, especially in case of alarms. One of the purposes of the surveillance is to check the presence of firefighters who enter after noise. IMY notes that camera surveillance to perform presence check on one workplace is in principle not allowed. In the current case, the interest in surveillance has been judged to weigh heavy, especially in case of alarm. IMY makes the assessment that the Rescue Service's surveillance is one such a case where camera surveillance as presence control can be considered permissible. At it In the assessment, special consideration has been given to the requirement for efficiency in the event of an alarm The rescue service, where seconds and minutes can make a difference for life and health. As regards the interests of the data subjects, it can be stated that the places as camera-monitored are workplaces where the employees, who are dependent on their employer, must be present during their working hours. The employees stay in the car park both in the event of an alarm but also in the performance of other tasks. The character of the place means that the employees are there in their everyday environment and can not opt out be monitored by cameras. The interest in integrity therefore weighs heavily as a starting point. The Privacy Protection Agency Record number: DI-2018-22697 10 (17) Date: 2021-06-09 When it comes to listening and recording sound in connection with camera surveillance is this is particularly sensitive to privacy and is only exceptionally allowed. As privacy enhancing action, however, a light comes on when the microphone enables oral communication between the control center and the car park is activated. IMY notes that audio listening is thus limited to situations that require communication and that the microphone has been used in sharp situations in case of alarm, when the need to monitor weighs particularly heavily. Furthermore, the sound that is listened to is mainly a conversation with them which is monitored. That the staff is part of the conversation in combination with lamp activation does that they are aware that eavesdropping is taking place. The measure reduces the intrusion somewhat applies to listening and recording of sound. IMY therefore makes the assessment that sound recording in the event of an alarm as it has been conducted is permitted. Furthermore, it appears that the surveillance area also includes a place for change during pick-up and undressing of alarm stands, where the camera surveillance in case of alarm for a short time has caught the employees in underwear or underwear when they change into expression clothing. If the staff in some cases has been monitored completely without clothing has not been clarified in the case. The rescue service believes that the employees are extremely used to handling privacy-sensitive situations both in the performance of their duties in rescue operations towards third parties, but also at the station work and internally in the organization then it exchanges take place in front of each other at each alarm situation, but also at regular practice and education. The rescue service believes that the internal commander who has access to real-time surveillance has a management responsibility regardless of whether it takes place in the physical space or via technical equipment, for the best possible management. According to the Rescue Service assessment, the exchange in front of colleagues and officers fits well in a proportionality perspective. IMY assesses that the interest in privacy at the place where the exchange takes place is significantly more prominent than in the rest of the carriage hall. However, it should be considered that the solution with replacement to the alarm stand in the car park and the camera surveillance of this is deemed necessary for the efficiency of the business, which reduces the intrusion somewhat. IMY does though overall assessment that the integrity interest in the site as a whole weighs very heavy, as the guarding has been conducted. This also applies if the staff in the change situation has underwear or underwear on. In assessing the two sides of the balance of interests, IMY has thus assessed that the need for surveillance weighs heavily, especially in the event of alarms, and that it was recorded, they employees, interests in terms of camera surveillance of the place of exchange weigh a lot heavy. When balancing between the needs of the Rescue Service and the interests of the employees do IMY further the following assessment. As for whether the data subjects can expect it current camera surveillance, the Rescue Service has stated that it currently has informed about the surveillance in several ways, including through signs in the premises. However, it has emerged that there are no guidelines for the situations in which the competent person staff have had the right to access real-time surveillance, which may mean that they employees have had difficulty assessing the extent to which the material has been used. In question on the balance of power between the Rescue Service and the employees, it has been established that the employees are in a dependent relationship with their employer, which means that the balance of power is uneven. As the monitoring of exchanges includes privacy-sensitive information, higher requirements are set than otherwise on protective measures to reduce the invasion of privacy. IMY thinks it is necessary with privacy-enhancing measures, such as a partial shielding of the place of exchange. The rescue service has stated as integrity-enhancing measures that the Privacy Protection Agency Record number: DI-2018-22697 11 (17) Date: 2021-06-09 in addition to the fact that a lamp is lit when the microphone is activated, the sound can only be heard from the car park in a headset in the control center and that there is access restriction to the control center. As for, for example, masking or demarcating parts of the site for replacement to minimize the collection of this data, have any such action not emerged during the IMY review. Regarding masking the place for replacement, the Rescue Service has in an opinion on 22 May 2019, stated the following (p.7). Given that most stations have alarm points hanging in the carriage hall, the purpose of the cameras on these surfaces completely disappeared was screened off, that is, the carriage hall would not be seen in the cameras. Of images from the camera surveillance that the Rescue Service has sent in an opinion on it January 16, 2019, however, it seems in the IMY's opinion that it is clear that without much difficulty should be able to partially delimit the uptake of the place of exchange from respective camera, so that no more than, for example, heads are captured by the surveillance. This can be done, for example, either by a mask on the camera views that show the place for replacement or through a physical screen in each carriage hall. With regard to the impact of camera surveillance on employees' rights and dignity, the IMY notes that it has not emerged that it has been possible to avoid that be camera-monitored during the change to alarm stand. To have camera surveillance when changing occurs in the event of an alarm, could have meant that the employees have repeatedly stayed in their underwear short periods in the guarded area. In an objective assessment, it can be considered go beyond what is proper treatment on the part of an employer. Overall, IMY states that the purposes of the Rescue Service are justified. The rescue service's interest in surveillance has been judged to weigh heavily, especially in the event of an alarm. However, the interests of the data subjects have been judged to weigh very heavily, especially as regards place for switching to alarm stands, which have been camera-monitored without masking or demarcation. Even when the special circumstances and requirements have been taken into account effectiveness that prevails in the Rescue Service's efforts, IMY states that they the interests of employees weigh more heavily in the question of the place of exchange in the event of an alarm and that the surveillance in this situation, as it has been carried out, is unreasonable in relation to employees. The monitoring of the exchange situation in the event of an alarm without delimitation has therefore contrary to the principle of correctness in Article 5 (1) (a) of the Data Protection Regulation. The principle of data minimization (Article 5 (1) (c)) Article 5 (1) (c) of the Data Protection Regulation states that personal data processed shall be adequate, relevant and not too extensive in relation to the purposes for which which they are processed, which is the principle of data minimization. The camera surveillance that is now being examined has been conducted around the clock in real time in the car hall at eight fire stations and has included space for replacement without any masking or demarcation. Internal officers at the command center have examined the camera surveillance at alarm. The rescue service has stated that it is not necessary to monitor the car park with cameras around the clock, without it only having to take place in the event of an alarm to the relevant station. The cameras have however, have been connected to the technical solution where the camera image is displayed around the clock around.Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten Record number: DI-2018-22697 12 (17) Date: 2021-06-09 As for the surveillance of the place for replacement, the Rescue Service has stated that it does not there are other less privacy-sensitive ways to achieve the same efficiency. The surveillance of the place for replacement is necessary as the staff does not stay at the station anymore than the time when they put on alarm racks. This means that communication with them must take place at the same time as they change, so that the rescue effort is not delayed. IMY's assessment - the principle of data minimization IMY has stated above that monitoring employees who change involves treatment of privacy-sensitive information that goes beyond what the individual should need accept. The surveillance of the fire stations has included employees, who are in dependency on their employer. It places special demands on the employer to take measures to reduce the invasion of privacy for employees. Any adaptation of the surveillance has not been carried out, in addition to access restriction, and place for replacement has been monitored by a camera without masking or delimitation. The monitoring has been ongoing around the clock in real time, even though it has been stated to be necessary only in the event of an alarm. Against this background, the IMY states that the Rescue Service's camera surveillance has entailed an excessive processing of personal data in relation to purposes. The treatment has thus taken place in violation of the principle of data minimization in Article 5 (1) (c) of the Data Protection Regulation. The purpose of the rescue service which has been intended for physical safety fire stations, ie to ensure shell protection and to assess the correctness of alarms connected to the key cabinets at the stations do not have, according to the Rescue Service including preventing and investigating crime. IMY states that the purposes are justified, but that camera surveillance around the clock is too far-reaching for specified purposes. It should be possible to achieve the said objectives with less far-reaching measures, to example through another access solution or an activated alarm in case of alarm from the key cabinet. This treatment has also taken place in violation of the principle of data minimization in Article 5 (1) (c) of the Data Protection Regulation. Security of processing (Article 32) As far as the rescue service's safety in connection with the camera surveillance is concerned, IMY has reviewed the organizational security in terms of authorization management and guidelines for the handling of the monitoring material. Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation regulates security in connection with the processing. According to paragraph 1, the personal data controller and the personal data assistant shall among other taking into account recent developments, implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment and the risks, of varying degrees of probability and seriousness, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of safety appropriate to the risk. According to paragraph 2, special consideration shall be given to the assessment of the appropriate level of safety risks posed by the treatment, in particular accidental or unlawful destruction; loss or alteration or to unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data that has been transferred, stored or otherwise processed.Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten Record number: DI-2018-22697 13 (17) Date: 2021-06-09 Point 4 states that the person responsible for personal data and the personal data assistant shall take measures to ensure that every natural person performing work under it oversight of the personal data controller or personal data assistant, and who may access to personal data, only processes these on instructions from it personal data controllers. Recital 39 of the Data Protection Ordinance states, among other things, that personal data should treated in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality for personal data and prevents unauthorized access to and unauthorized use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing. The rescue service has stated that 29 people have had access to the command center where the camera surveillance in the event of an alarm has been taken up to full screen view, of which 6 internal officers as has its workplace in the command center, 16 other officers and managers who have tasks in the control center in the event of an alarm or staff work and 7 operating technicians for maintenance of premises and technology. Not all employees stay there at the same time, but the employee who has taken note of the camera material is on-duty internal officer in case of alarm. Every however, employees who have access to the management center have had the opportunity to see the camera image and what is going on at a fire station in real time. In cases where the effort is complicated or several parallel operations in progress may be several internal commanders or others management functions are in the management center at the same time and have then been able to see the camera image. The rescue service has stated that there have been no guidelines for when a competent person has been allowed to look at the camera image. The approach, however, has been to the camera image manually recorded in full screen view in the event of an alarm at the current station. IMY's assessment - safety of treatment As for who has access to the footage from the camera surveillance IMY states that the Rescue Service has stated that a number of people have access to the room where the camera surveillance is displayed in real time, the control center. Even if it is not it is clear how the full screen view showing the camera surveillance is delimited, IMY states that at different times and situations there may be a need for more people have access to real-time surveillance in the event of an alarm, as the Rescue Service has described the handling. The business also runs around the clock, which means that more than otherwise need to have access to the material. IMY therefore finds that it may be justified to a larger number of employees are authorized to access information from the camera surveillance. However, it is central that the person responsible for personal data then has organizational measures in place to ensure the security of the data. Among otherwise clear guidelines are needed for who should have access to the material, under which conditions and whether the competence is surrounded by special restrictions for the handling of the image material. The IMY states that a data controller in accordance with Article 32 (1) shall take appropriate action technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security that is appropriate in relation to the risk. When assessing the appropriate level of security, special account is taken of the risks posed by the treatment, including unauthorized access the personal data processed. The person responsible for personal data must, according to the article 32.4 of the Data Protection Regulation also take measures to ensure that a physical person only processes personal data according to instructions from it personal data controller.Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten Record number: DI-2018-22697 14 (17) Date: 2021-06-09 The more sensitive the information that is processed, the higher the security requirements for it it shall be considered appropriate in relation to the treatment carried out. That guidelines has been missing for when and how the camera surveillance may be used may mean that those who has handled the camera surveillance has gone beyond what is necessary and thus allowed. It also means that there may be uncertainty for those who have camera surveillance, in which situations the camera surveillance has been used and whether it has been limited to situations where surveillance has been necessary. As the monitoring has been conducted, it has included systematic monitoring of employees and privacy-sensitive processing of personal data with regard to surveillance of employees changing. The requirements for security are thus raised for it to be considered have an appropriate level. As guidelines are said to have been completely missing, IMY states that The rescue service has breached the requirement to ensure that personal data only handled according to instructions from the person responsible for personal data and that the requirement for appropriate organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security in relation to the risk is thus not met. IMY therefore notes that The civil protection service has processed personal data in violation of Article 32 (1) and (4) of the Data Protection Regulation. Choice of intervention Legal regulation If there has been a violation of the Data Protection Regulation, IMY has a number corrective powers under Article 58 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation. The supervisory authority may, among other things, order the person responsible for personal data to ensure this that the processing takes place in accordance with the Regulation and if required in a specific way and within a specific period. It follows from Article 58 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation that in accordance with Article 83, the IMY shall: impose penalty fees in addition to or instead of other corrective measures such as referred to in Article 58 (2), depending on the circumstances of each individual case. For authorities, Article 83 (7) of the Data Protection Regulation may specify national rules that authorities may be subject to administrative penalty fees. According to ch. 6 § 2 Under the Data Protection Act, penalty fees can be decided for authorities, but up to a maximum SEK 5,000,000 or SEK 10,000,000 depending on whether the violation relates articles covered by Article 83 (4) or 83 (5) of the Data Protection Regulation. Article 83 (2) sets out the factors to be taken into account when deciding on an administrative sanction fee shall be imposed, but also what shall affect the penalty fee size. Of central importance for the assessment of the seriousness of the infringement is its character, severity and duration. In the case of a minor infringement may, in accordance with recital 148 of the Data Protection Regulation, issue a reprimand instead of imposing a penalty fee. Penalty fee The inspections carried out by IMY have shown that the Rescue Service has processed personal data in violation of Article 5 (1) (a) and (c) and Article 32 (1) and (4) of the Data Protection Regulation. In assessing whether the violations are so serious that an administrative sanction fee is to be imposed, IMY has taken into account that the processing of personal data has been intended camera surveillance of employees in a position of dependence, in their everyday environment that has including privacy-sensitive situations. The monitoring has taken place systematically under the Integrity Protection Authority. Record number: DI-2018-22697 15 (17) Date: 2021-06-09 long time. The monitoring has meant that more information than necessary has been processed then on the other hand, it has taken place around the clock in real time, despite the fact that there is only a need for alarms, and partly without any masking or demarcation having taken place of the area where the employees changes. The scope of the surveillance has been relatively large as it has taken place around the clock around in real time in the car park at eight fire stations, which means a not insignificant number of registrants has been affected. Furthermore, it has not emerged that the Rescue Service, while the camera surveillance is in progress, in addition to a light indicating activated microphone as well as certain access restrictions, have taken some measures to reduce the intrusion on the employees. IMY's assessment is that the treatment did not involve one minor infringement. The violations must therefore lead to an administrative penalty fee. The provisions of the Data Protection Ordinance that the Rescue Service has violated covered by both Article 83 (4) of the Data Protection Regulation and Article 83 (5). The the maximum amount of the penalty fee is according to Article 83.4 and 83.5 and ch. 6 § 2 second paragraph of the Data Protection Act SEK 5 million regarding the violations of the article SEK 32 and 10 million in respect of the infringements of Article 5. The administrative penalty fee shall be effective, proportionate and deterrent. This means that the amount must be determined so that the administrative the penalty fee leads to correction, that it has a preventive effect and that it moreover, is proportionate in relation to both current infringements and to the supervisee's ability to pay. In determining an amount that is effective, proportionate and dissuasive can IMY note that the Rescue Service has camera-monitored employees who are in dependent relationship with their employer, in a privacy-sensitive situation when switching to alarm stand, which has meant that they have been systematically filmed in underwear or underwear at their workplace. Surveillance has been going on around the clock in real time despite that need has only existed in the event of an alarm. The rescue service has in these respects not have taken the necessary measures to limit the collection of data. The surveillance has taken place systematically for a long time and included eight fire stations. It has been the question of a relatively large number of people in the command center who have been able to take part of the surveillance. Although these have been authorized to take part in the surveillance has there was a complete lack of guidelines and instructions for the situations of competent persons had the right to access the camera surveillance. These circumstances are seen as aggravating. In its assessment, IMY has taken into account the Rescue Service's weighty need for the camera surveillance and the requirement for efficiency that is the responsibility of the Rescue Service, as well the socially important task of preventing and limiting accidents in the event of accidents and danger damage to people, property or the environment where seconds and minutes can be crucial. Account has also been taken of the fact that the current rules only began to be applied in May 2018. The trial has thus been limited to the time thereafter. It has also emerged that the camera surveillance has now ceased. It is clear that the decision in the case has dragged on not the Rescue Service to blame for the assessment of the violations. After an overall assessment, IMY finds that the Executive Board of the Rescue Service East Skaraborg must pay an administrative sanction fee of SEK 350,000, of which SEK 300,000 refers to the violations of Article 5 (1) (a) and 5.1 (c), respectively, and SEK 50,000 refers to infringements of Article 32 (1) and Article 32 (4) of the Data Protection Regulation.

Klarna thus processed personal data in violation of Articles 5 (1) (a), 5 (2), 12 (1) and 13 (1) (c) of the Data Protection Regulation. IMY notes that Klarna left during the period March 17 to June 26, 2020 incomplete and misleading information about who were the recipients of various categories of personal data when such were shared with Swedish and foreign respectively credit reporting companies. Klarna thus processed personal data in violation of Articles 5 (1) (a), 5 (2), 12 (1) and 13 (1) (e) of the Data Protection Regulation. IMY notes that Klarna during the period March 17 to June 26, 2020 will not provided information on to which countries outside the EU / EEA personal data transferred and where and how the individual could access or obtain documents concerning the safeguard measures applicable to the transfer to a third country. Klarna thereby processed personal data in breach of Articles 5 (1) (a), 5 (2), 12 (1) and 13 (1) (f) the Data Protection Regulation. IMY notes that Klarna left during the period March 17 to June 26, 2020 incomplete information about the periods during which personal data would be stored and the criteria used to determine these periods. Klarna thereby processed personal data in breach of Articles 5 (1) (a), 5 (2), 12 (1) and 13 (2) (a) i the Data Protection Regulation. IMY notes that Klarna left during the period March 17 to June 26, 2020 insufficient information regarding the data subjects' rights as follows.  the information provided about the right of the personal data controller request the deletion of personal data in accordance with Article 17 of the Data Protection Regulation did not comply with the requirement of transparency  the information provided about the right of the personal data controller request a limitation of the processing of the data subject under Article 18 i the Data Protection Regulation did not comply with the requirement of transparency  the information provided on the right to data portability in accordance with Article 20 i the Data Protection Regulation did not comply with the requirement of transparency  information provided on the right to object to the processing of personal data under Article 21 of the Data Protection Regulation did not comply with the requirement on transparency. Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with concerning the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and on the repeal of Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Regulation)., Integrity Protection Authority Registration number: DI-2019-4062 3 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 Klarna thus processed personal data in violation of Articles 5.1 a, 5.2, 12.1 and 13.2 b of the Data Protection Regulation. IMY states that Klarnas Data Protection Information during the period March 17 to on June 26, 2020 lacked meaningful information about the logic behind and the meaning and the foreseeable consequences of automated decision-making, including profiling, pursuant to Article 22 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. Klarna thus treated personal data in breach of Articles 5.1 (a), 5 (2), 12 (1), 13 (2) (f) and 14 (2) (g) i the Data Protection Regulation. IMY decides on the basis of Articles 58 (2) and 83 of the Data Protection Regulation that Klarna Bank AB must pay an administrative penalty fee of 7,500,000 (seven million five hundred thousand) kroner. 1 Report on the supervisory matter Klarna provides services that involve lending, as well as payment services such as does not include lending, including payment initiation services and account information services. IMY has read Klarnas Dataskyddsinformation som is published on the company's Swedish website (https://www.klarna.com/se/). IMY has in connection with this, it has been established that there is uncertainty about, among other things, for whom purpose personal data is collected and processed and how the data thereafter gallras. Article 5 (1) (a) of the Data Protection Regulation states, inter alia, that personal data shall: treated in an open manner in relation to the data subject (the principle of transparency). It further follows from Article 5 (2) that the data controller shall be responsible for and be able to show that the principles set out in 5.1 are complied with (the principle of liability). IMY has initiated supervision of Klarna to investigate the extent to which Klarnas Data protection information meets these requirements. Within the framework of supervision, IMY has audited how Klarna complies with the provisions on clear and unambiguous information and communication under Article 12 (1) and the right to information of personal data under Articles 13 and 14 and the right to information on the right to object under Article 21.4. IMY has not taken a position on Klarna's personal data processing in otherwise complies with the Data Protection Regulation. Supervision has taken place through correspondence. The inspection began on March 27, 2019 through that IMY sent a letter to Klarna with questions about the company personal data processing. The questions were based on the information provided by Klarna provided about its processing of personal data in the one published at that time The data protection information on the company's Swedish website. Klarna came in with one opinion on 26 April 2019. An annex with a summary was attached to the opinion over the purposes for which each category of personal data was processed indication of the applicable retention period. Klarna then revised his Data protection information as of 19 July 2019. Due to Klarna's opinion and the company's revised Data Protection Information asked IMY supplementary questions the company in a letter dated 1 August 2019. Klarna subsequently submitted an opinion on September 27, 2019. Klarna subsequently revised its Data Protection Information as of the 17th March 2020. Klarna again revised its Data Protection Information on 26 June 2020. IMY has also obtained the terms of service for the account information service ""My Finances"" as Klarna in its first statement to the IMY stated that the consumer accepts ""Special conditions"" for this service. IMY's assessment refers to Klarnas Data protection information as it was designed from 17 March 2020 to 26 June, Privacy Protection Agency Record number: DI-2019-4062 4 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 2020, Appendix 1, and Klarnas Terms of Use as they were drafted on April 2, 2020, Appendix 2. IMY describes what Klarna has stated in its opinions in relevant parts below the reasons for the decision below. 2 Grounds for the decision 2.1 Applicable provisions Article 5 (1) (a) of the Data Protection Regulation states, inter alia, that the data shall: processed in a legal, correct and transparent manner in relation to the data subject (legality, correctness and transparency). It further follows from Article 5 (2) that the data controller shall be responsible for and be able to show that the principles listed in 5.1 are complied with (liability). It follows from Article 12 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation that the controller shall: take appropriate measures to provide the data subject with all information that: referred to in Articles 13 and 14 and all communications pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 and 34 which refers to treatment in a concise, clear and distinct, comprehensible and easily accessible form, using clear and unambiguous language, in particular for information that is specific aimed at children. The information must be provided in writing, or in some other form, including, where appropriate, in electronic form. If the data subject requests it may the information is provided orally, provided that the identity of the data subject has been proven in other ways. Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation stipulates the information to be provided if the personal data is collected from the data subject. Article 13 (1) states this that if personal data concerning a registered person is collected from the data subject, the person responsible for personal data shall, when the personal data is obtained, to the data subject provide information as set out in Article 13 (1) (a) to (f). It follows from Article 13 (2) that it person responsible for personal data in the collection of personal data, in addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, shall provide the data subject with additional information in accordance with 13.2 a-f, which is required to ensure fair and transparent treatment. According to Article 13 (3) in addition, the person responsible for personal data, if he intends to process personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, before that further processing provide the registered information about this second purpose as well additional relevant information pursuant to paragraph 2. Article 13 (4) states that paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if and to the extent that the data subject already has the information. It follows from recital 39 that any processing of personal data must be lawful and fair. It should be clear to natural persons how personal data concerns them collected, used, consulted or otherwise treated and in which the extent to which personal data is processed or will be processed. The principle of openness requires that all information and communication in connection with the processing of this personal data is easily accessible and easy to understand and that a clear language is used. This principle applies above all to the information to registered about the identity of the data controller and the purpose of the processing as well as additional information to ensure fair and open treatment for those concerned natural persons and their right to receive confirmation and notification of which personal data concerning those processed. Natural people should be made aware on risks, rules, protective measures and rights in connection with the processing of, The Swedish Data Protection Agency Record number: DI-2019-4062 5 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 personal data and how they can exercise their rights with respect to the treatment. Recital 60 states that the principles of fair and transparent treatment require that data subjects are informed that treatment is taking place and the purpose of it. The personal data controller should provide the data subject with all additional information such as required to ensure fair and transparent treatment, taking into account the specific circumstances and context of personal data processing. In addition the data subject should be informed of the existence of profiling and of the consequences of such profiling. If the personal data is collected from it registered, he should also be informed if he or she is obliged to provide personal data and the consequences if he or she does not provide them. This information may be provided combined with standardized symbols to provide one clear, comprehensible, easy-to-read and meaningful overview of the planned the treatment. If such symbols are displayed electronically, they should be machine-readable. It follows from recital 61, inter alia, that information on the processing of personal data concerning the data subject should be provided to him or her at that time the personal data is collected from the data subject or, if the personal data is obtained directly from another source, within a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances of the case. If personal data can be legitimately disclosed to another recipient, they should registered persons are informed the first time the personal data is disclosed to this receiver. As regards the concept of profiling, this is defined in Article 4 (4) as any form of profiling automatic processing of personal data consisting of that personal data used to assess certain personal characteristics of a natural person, in particular to analyze or predict the work performance of this natural person, financial situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, whereabouts or transfers, Article 22 regulates automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Of the provision states that the data subject shall have the right not to be the subject of a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which has legal consequences for him or her or similarly significantly affect him or her. Examples of such decisions are given in recital 71, among others automated rejection of an online credit application. Exceptions to this prohibition apply if the decision is necessary for the conclusion or performance of an agreement between it registered and the data controller, such decisions are permitted under Union law or the national law of a Member State to which the controller is subject and which lays down appropriate measures to protect the data subject's rights, freedoms and legitimate interests, or is based on the express consent of the data subject. If an exception may be made in connection with an agreement or due to consent, it shall personal data controllers implement appropriate measures to ensure this registered rights, freedoms and legal interests, at least the right to personal contact with the personal data controller to be able to express their opinion and dispute the decision. Finally, the former so-called Article 29 Working Party has developed guidelines on partly openness, WP260 rev.01 (WP260), partly about automated individually decision-making and profiling, WP251 rev.01 (WP251), which are described in relevant parts under the IMY assessments below. The European Data Protection Board, EDPB, has endorsed these guidelines. Initially, however, the following can be highlighted. Article, Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2019-4062 6 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 The 29 Working Group emphasizes in WP260 that transparency is an overarching obligation according to the Data Protection Regulation which applies to three key areas; i) how they data subjects may be informed about fair processing; ii) how the data controllers communicate with the data subjects in relation to their rights under the Data Protection Regulation, and (iii) how the data controllers facilitate the exercised their rights. Openness is also an expression of it principle of fairness in the processing of personal data set out in Article 8 of the EU Charter on fundamental rights. Article 12 stipulates the form of information provided to the data subject; namely, in a concise, clear and distinct, comprehensible and easily accessible form, with use of clear and distinct language, in particular for information specifically aimed at children. The information shall be provided in writing, or in some other form, including, where applicable is appropriate, in electronic form. If the data subject requests it, he will receive the information provided orally, provided that the identity of the data subject has been proven in other ways. Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation sets requirements for what information it contains the person responsible for personal data must provide the data subject if the personal data is collected from the data subject and when the information is to be provided, namely when the personal data is obtained from the data subject. However, neither Article 12 nor 13 regulates in detail the form or location of the information submitted to the data subject. WP260 states that the information should be published in for example, a data protection information made available on it website of the data controller. Furthermore, it appears that on each side of the website should have a clearly visible direct link to the data protection information that should have been provided with an appropriate heading (eg ""Privacy"", ""Privacy Policy"" or ""Data protection message""). The Article 29 Working Party therefore recommends a best practice which means that a link to the data protection information is provided or that such information is provided on the same page as the personal data is obtained from, when personal data is collected online. Furthermore, the Article 29 Working Party considers that a stratified data protection information should be used if the data controller has one website so that visitors to the website can navigate to specific parts of the data protection information that is of greatest interest to them. All the information that addressed to the data subjects should, however, also be available to them on one and the same place or in a complete document (in digital or paper format), as they Registered users can easily access if they want to read all the information addressed to them. The following also appears from the above-mentioned guideline, pp. 7-9: “The requirement that information provided or communicated to the data subjects shall being in a ""concise, clear and distinct"" form means that those responsible for personal data should present the information / communicate in an effective and concise way to avoid information exhaustion. The information should be clearly distinguished from other information such as does not relate to privacy, such as contractual terms or general terms of use. IN Internet contexts, layered privacy policies / privacy notices can do that possible for the data subjects to go directly to a certain part of the privacy policy / privacy statement they want to read, instead of scrolling through large amounts of text to find the part in question. The requirement that the information must be ""comprehensible"" means that it should be understandable by one average member of the intended target group. Comprehensibility is closely linked to the requirement of a clear and distinct language. A person responsible for personal data will receive knowledge, The Swedish Data Protection Agency Record number: DI-2019-4062 7 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 about the persons about whom they collect information and can use it to determine what would probably be understandable to the target group \[…\] An important aspect of the principle of transparency described in these provisions is that they registered in advance should be able to determine the purpose and consequences of treatment and that it should not come as a surprise to them at a later date stage how their personal data has been used. This is also an important aspect of the principle of fairness under Article 5 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, where there is in fact a linked to recital 39, which states that natural persons “should be made aware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in connection with the processing of personal data ”. In the case of complex, technical or unexpected data processing In particular, the Article 29 Working Party considers that data controllers are not the only ones should provide the information set out in Articles 13 and 14 (which dealt with later in these guidelines), without them even having to specify, in a separate section and in an unambiguous language, the most significant consequences of the treatment, with in other words, how the special treatment specified in a privacy policy / one privacy notice will actually affect the data subjects. In line with the principle of liability and recital 39, the data controllers should assess whether there are special risks for natural persons whose personal data are processed in one in such a way that the data subjects should be given attention. That way you can get one an overview of the types of treatments that could have the greatest impact on them registered fundamental rights and freedoms with regard to their protection personal data. ""Easily accessible"" means that the data subjects do not have to look for the information; it should be immediately clear to them where and how they can access the information; for example by giving the information directly or linking to the data subjects, by clear guidance or in response to a question from a natural person (eg in a privacy policy / a privacy statement in several layers online, in ""Frequently asked questions"", via contextual pop-ups that are activated when the registrants fill in one online form or in an interactive digital context via a chatbot interface etc \[...\] The requirement for a clear and distinct language means that the information should be provided in such a simple way as possible and that complicated sentences and language structures should be avoided. The information should be concrete and accurate, and it should not be abstract or ambiguous or can be interpreted in different ways. Above all, the purposes and legal bases should for the processing of personal data be clear. "" In the following, the IMY assesses whether the requirements for transparency and information are met in different ways parts through Klarnas Data Protection Information as it was designed during the period 17 March to 26 June 2020. 2.2 IMY's assessment of Klarnas Data Protection Information meets the requirements of Articles 5 (1) (a), 5, 2, 12, 13 and 14 (i) the Data Protection Regulation 2.2.1 IMY's assessment of Klarna's information pursuant to Article 13 (1) (c) Pursuant to Article 13 (1) (c) of the Data Protection Regulation, information on the purposes must be provided with the processing for which the personal data is intended as well as the legal basis for the treatment., Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2019-4062 8 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 Klarnas Data Protection Information Section 2 of Klarnas Data Protection Information is entitled “What personal data do we use? ”. Section 2.2 is entitled ""Information we collect about you"" and of it the introductory paragraph follows “Depending on which Services you choose to use, we can will collect the following information about you, either yourself or through third parties (for example, credit bureaus, anti-fraud agencies, shops or public databases) ”. This is followed by an enumeration of what information it ""can"" move about. The last point in the list shows “Service-specific personal data - within the framework of some of our Services, we may collect and process additional personal data not covered by the categories above. See Section 4 below for to find out what these additional personal data are for each Service. ”. Section 3 of the Data Protection Information is entitled “What personal data do we process, for what purpose, and on what legal basis? "" and of the introductory paragraph states “Depending on which Services you use, Klarna may process your personal data for the purposes listed below, based on the legal bases which is accounted for at each purpose. You can see more specific information about how your personal data is processed in some of our Services in Section 4 below. ”. Thereafter follows a table with three columns, where the first column indicates the purpose of the treatment, the second column the personal data processed and the third column legal basis for the treatment. Section 4 of the Data Protection Information is entitled “In particular processing of personal data in some of Klarnas Tjänster ”and of the introductory paragraph appears “This section describes certain processing of your personal data that is specific to a particular Service. To get more information about our Services and theirs functionality, see the terms of use for each Service. ”. IMY's assessment IMY notes that the Data Protection Information Section 4 regarding the service “Min economy ”lacks clear information about the purposes of the treatments for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing in violation with the requirement of Article 13 (1) (c) of the Data Protection Regulation. The service ""My Finance"" is mentioned in Section 4.4 of the Data Protection Information, which is entitled “Clear user experience provided in accordance with Klarna's Terms of Use ”. It appears below the subheading “Klarna app” that “If you use the Klarna app, will personal data to be processed in order to provide the Services you choose to use inside the App, such as: \[…\] ”, followed by a list of different services in a bulleted list. One of these services is the ""My Finances"" service: “Your affiliated bank accounts (My Finance Service): Through this Service get you an overview of your entire finances, not just your transactions with Klarna, but also over connected accounts. When you choose to use this Service comes Able to process information about the bank accounts and other accounts (such as card accounts) you choose to connect, and collect information such as account number, bank, historical transactions from connected accounts, as well as balances and assets. Based on that information will Klarna visualize and give you tools to control your finances, using offers tailored to your specific situation (which may involve profiling as described in Section 6). This is done by comparing yours expenses with expenses from other users of the Service. Based on the comparison, we can ,, The Swedish Data Protection Agency Record number: DI-2019-4062 9 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 together with partners to us, offer ways to minimize your fasting and variable costs."" There is no information regarding the legal basis the processing of personal data regarding the service ""My Finances"" takes place. In addition it is not clear from the information contained in the enumeration in Section 4.4 in the Data Protection Information above, which specific personal data is processed within the framework of the service or the specific purposes of the treatment for which the personal data is intended. IMY further states that the service ""My Finance"" does not is mentioned in Klarnas' terms of use, which are generally available on Klarnas Swedish website, see Appendix 2 (Klarna's terms of use updated on 2 April 2020). Some separate terms or separate data protection information regarding the service, is also not generally available on Klarna's Swedish website. This notwithstanding that Klarna, on page 9 in its first statement to IMY, dated 26 April 2019, has stated that The ""My Finances"" service is an account information service that is available in the Klarna app after acceptance of ""Klarnas Terms of Use"" and that the consumer also accepts ""special terms"" for the service. The special conditions, ""Terms of service for the My Finance service"", may be taken by the consumer part of when the service is accepted. Regarding information about personal data processing according to the data protection regulation, the special conditions only refer back to The data protection information. The additional information provided in Section 4 of the The data protection information must appear in the special conditions is thus missing. IMY believes that the information that Klarna provides about the purposes of the treatment and the legal basis for the treatment does not meet the requirements of Article 13 (1) (c) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. The information is not concise, clear and distinct nor easily accessible. It therefore does not meet the requirements of Article 12 (1). The IMY considers that the infringement of Article 13 (1) (c) of the Data Protection Regulation, with account has also been taken of other infringements of Articles 13 and 14 set out in this decision, is so serious that it also infringes Articles 5 (1) a and 5.2. IMY therefore finds that Klarna violates Articles 5 (1) (a), 5 (2), 12 (1) and 13 (1) (c) i the Data Protection Regulation. 2.2.2. IMY's assessment of Klarna's information pursuant to Article 13 (1) (e) Pursuant to Article 13 (1) (e), information shall be provided on the recipients or categories of recipients who are to access the personal data, where applicable. Klarnas Data Protection Information In section 7 The data protection information informs Klarna about which stakeholders it is data subjects' personal data may be shared with. Section 7.4 describes how information is shared with credit reporting companies. Paragraph one states the following: 7.4 Credit Information Agencies If you are applying to use a Service that involves providing credit (see Section 4.1 above regarding which Services include credit), your personal data may come, Privacy Protection Agency Record number: DI-2019-4062 10 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 to be shared with credit bureaus, for the following purposes: To assess your creditworthiness in connection with your application for one of Klarna's payment methods, that confirm your identity and contact information, as well as protect you and other customers from fraud. Your phone number and address may also be shared credit bureaus to enable them to send a notification to a credit report performed on you. Depending on the rules of the country where you live will be sent a physical letter with information that a credit report has been made on you to you, or the letter is sent electronically. Your payment behavior may reported back to the credit bureaus by Klarna, which may affect your future credit rating. When a credit bureau receives an inquiry credit information from us, they may place a listing on your profile, which may seen by other companies providing credit. Credit bureaus may share your information with other organizations. The credit bureaus we collaborates with in Sweden you see here. On pages 21-22 in their second statement to IMY, Klarna dated 27 September 2019 specified the meaning of the information. Klarna states, regarding information relating to identification, which information is shared with credit reporting companies for the purposes set out in paragraph one varies depending on whether the consumer is shopping in a country that has a social security number or not. In countries there social security numbers are available parts Klarna only the consumer's social security number with credit reporting companies for the purposes requested (identification). Klarna does not have to share personal information such as address and phone number with credit reporting companies in Sweden to identify the registered person. In countries where social security numbers do not exist Klarna usually needs to share the consumer's name, address, date of birth and telephone numbers with credit reporting companies for specified purposes. With regard to the disclosure of information about the data subject's payment behavior states Clear that information about payment behavior is not reported in Swedish credit reporting companies. If, and to what extent, Klarna reports back payment behaviors to credit reporting companies in other countries where Klarna offers their services vary depending on each country's legislation and the agreement as Klarna has with the respective credit information company. IMY's assessment IMY states that the information in the Data Protection Information refers to the disclosure of personal data to both Swedish and foreign credit information companies. Which type of information provided to Swedish and foreign credit reporting companies are not listed. IMY believes that the information that Klarna provides about how information is shared credit reporting companies do not meet the requirement of transparency. The information is incomplete and does not explain what information is provided to Swedish respectively foreign credit reporting companies. The registered person may, among other things, be led to believe that information on payment behavior at Klarna is disclosed to, and registered by, Swedish credit reporting companies. This is directly misleading. IMY considers that the information that Klarna provides about the categories of recipients that shall not have access to the personal data does not meet the requirements of Article 13 (1) (e) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. The information is not concise, clear and distinct nor easily accessible. It therefore does not meet the requirements of Article 12 (1), the Privacy Protection Authority Record number: DI-2019-4062 11 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 The IMY considers that the infringement of Article 13 (1) (e) of the Data Protection Regulation, with account has also been taken of other infringements of Articles 13 and 14 set out in this decision, is so serious that it also constitutes a breach of 5.1 a and 5.2. IMY therefore finds that Klarna violates Articles 5 (1) (a), 5 (2), 12 (1) and 13 (1) (e) i the Data Protection Regulation. 2.2.3. IMY's assessment of Klarna's information pursuant to Article 13 (1) (f) According to Article 13 (1) (f), information must be provided that the data controller refers to to transfer personal data to a third country or an international organization; and whether or not a decision by the Commission on the adequate level of protection exists or, in the case of the transfers referred to in Article 46, 47 or other Article 49 (1) paragraph, reference to appropriate or appropriate protective measures and how a copy of they can be obtained or where these have been made available. Klarnas Data Protection Information Section 8 of the Data Protection Information is entitled “Where do we process yours personal data? ” and from this it follows: “We always strive to process your personal data within the EU / EEA. In some situations, such as when we share your information within the Klarna Group or with one supplier or subcontractor with operations outside the EU / EEA, can your personal data will, however, be processed outside the EU / EEA. About the store you shop at are outside the EU / EEA, our sharing with the store will also mean that yours data are transferred outside the EU / EEA. We ensure that an adequate level of protection exists, and that appropriate safeguards are taken in accordance with applicable data protection requirements, such as the GDPR, when we transfer your data outside the EU / EEA. These protective measures consist of ensuring that the third country to which the data is transmitted is the subject of a the Commission that there is an adequate level of protection, that the European Commission standard clauses have been entered into between Klarna and the recipient, or that the recipient is registered under the so-called US Privacy Shield procedure. "" IMY's assessment Of the comments of the Article 29 Working Party on the information requirement in the Guideline on transparency, pages 39-40 of WP260, states the following regarding Article 13 (1) (f): ""Information should be provided on the relevant article of the Data Protection Regulation for transmission and associated mechanism (eg decision on adequate level of protection under Article 45 / binding company rules in accordance with Article 47 / standardized data protection rules pursuant to Article 46 (2) / derogations and safeguard measures pursuant to Article 49, etc.). Furthermore, information is provided on where and how to access or obtain the document in question, for example by linking to the mechanism used. According to the principle of justice, it should information provided on transfers to third countries be as meaningful as possible the registered. This generally means that the names of third countries must be indicated. "" IMY states that Klarnas Data Protection Information lacks information on where and how the individual can access or receive documents regarding the protection measures for, The Privacy Protection Agency Record number: DI-2019-4062 12 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 transmission as described in the Data Protection Information. Furthermore, information on countries outside the EU / EEA to which personal data are transferred, in accordance with Article 29 working group recommendation above. IMY considers that the information that Klarna provides about the personal data controller intends to transfer personal data to a third country and whether a decision of the Commission whether or not there is an adequate level of protection or, in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46, 47 or the second subparagraph of Article 49 (1), appropriate or appropriate safeguards and how a copy of them can be obtained or where these have been made available do not meet the requirements of Article 13 (1) (e) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. The information is not concise, clear and distinct nor easily accessible. It therefore does not meet the requirements of Article 12 (1). The IMY considers that the infringement of Article 13 (1) (f) of the Data Protection Regulation, taking into account also taken to other infringements of Articles 13 and 14 set out therein decision, is so serious that it also infringes Articles 5 (1) (a) and 5.2. IMY therefore finds that Klarna violates Articles 5 (1) (a), 5 (2), 12 (1) and 13 (1) (f) i the Data Protection Regulation. 2.2.4. IMY's assessment of Klarna's information pursuant to Article 13 (2) (a) According to Article 13 (2) (a), information shall be provided on the period during which personal data will be stored or, if this is not possible, the criteria set by used to determine this period. Klarnas Data Protection Information Section 9 of the Data Protection Information is entitled “How long do we save yours personal data? ” and this shows the following: “We will process your personal data for the period of time needed to pursue the respective purpose of our treatment. These purposes are presented in this Data protection information. This means that when we stop processing your personal data for a specific purpose, we may still retain the data for as long as the data are needed for other purposes, but then only for processing in accordance with the remaining purposes. Especially:  As long as you have accepted Klarna's Terms of Use and until you have resigned these (by contacting us or by instructing us to remove your personal data through a request to be deleted) we will process the personal data we need to provide our Services to you, which includes information about your previous purchases.  We process personal data in credit information for the purpose of re-processing Assess your credit rating for up to 90 days from that the credit report was taken.  We process information about debts for the purpose of assessing yours creditworthiness for a period of three (3) years after the debt has been settled - which takes place either through payment of the debt or that the debt is written off of or sold., Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2019-4062 13 (25) Date: 2022-03-28  We process recorded telephone calls to Klarna's customer service for up to 90 days from the day of recording.  We process personal data for the purpose of complying with applicable legislation, such as consumer law, banking and money laundering legislation, and accounting rules. Depending on which applicable law, your personal data may be stored in up to ten years after the termination of the customer relationship. "" IMY's assessment Of the comments of the Article 29 Working Party on the information requirement in the Guideline on transparency, page 40 of WP260, states the following regarding Article 13 (2) (a): ""This is related to the requirement for data minimization in Article 5 (1) (c) and on storage limitation in Article 5 (1) (e). The shelf life (or the criteria used to: determine this) may be governed by factors such as statutory requirements or guidelines within industry, but it should be stated in such a way that it registered, based on its own situation, can assess the storage time for specific tasks / purposes. It is not enough that the person responsible for personal data generally states that the personal data is retained for that long necessary for the legitimate purposes of the treatment. In relevant cases different storage times should be specified for different categories of personal data and / or different processing purposes, including filing time where appropriate. "" Klarna has, on page 13 in its first statement to IMY, dated April 26, 2019, stated that the purposes for which each category of personal data is processed, with applicable storage period, is reported in an appendix that has been submitted to IMY. The appendix consists of a table with three columns, where the left column shows the purposes of the treatment based on the (at the current time) description in The data protection information, the column in the middle reports the time for which Klarna processes the current category of personal data for the current purpose, ie. storage time, and the right-hand column reports comments aimed at whether special conditions for the treatment for more specific purposes or more specific personal data is available. Here it appears that Klarna processes and stores personal data for more purposes than what appears from section 9 of Klarnas data protection information. It appears, among other things, that personal data is processed and stored for research purposes for two years. Furthermore, Klarna has, on pages 13-14 in the above-mentioned opinion, stated that, in addition the purposes set out in the said appendix, Klarna processes personal data within the framework of Klarna's customer service as follows:  “Incoming telephone calls are recorded for quality and security reasons. The recordings are saved for this purpose for 3 months, after which they are deleted. Incoming and outgoing e-mails are retained for 7 years from the time the message was received or sent.  Information that an individual consumer has chosen to block himself from using Klarna's credit products are saved to handle the block until the consumer himself announces that he wishes to lift the block (ie. as a starting point for the time being)., The Swedish Data Protection Agency Record number: DI-2019-4062 14 (25) Date: 2022-03-28  Notes relating to a dispute or other types of disputes are kept in 10 years from the time of closing the case. The reason for this is that one consumer at a later stage may contact Klarna in the same or similar matters. The time period is based on the limitation period according to the statute of limitations (1981: 130).  Notes of other kinds than above are preserved for 5 years from the time of the registration, ie. from the time the note was made. The reason for this is that one consumer at a later stage may contact Klarna in the same or similar matters. "" Of these purposes and retention periods, only the preservation information of incoming phone calls for quality and safety reasons for three months that are found in section 9 of Klarnas Data Protection Information. In light of the above, IMY considers the information in Klarnas Data protection information does not comply with the requirement of Article 13 (2) (a) of the Data Protection Regulation that information must be provided about the period during which the personal data comes to be stored or the criteria used to determine this period when Klarnas opinion and appendix mentioned above clearly show that Klarna processes personal data for more purposes and has more detailed storage times, and in addition criteria such as used to determine these periods, which are not set out in section 9 of The data protection information. IMY considers that the information that Klarna provides about the period during which personal data will be stored or, if this is not possible, the criteria set by used to determine this period does not meet the requirements of Article 13 (2) (a). The information is not concise, clear and distinct, nor is it easily accessible. It meets thus not the requirements of Article 12 (1). The IMY considers that the infringement of Article 13 (2) (a) of the Data Protection Regulation, with account has also been taken of other infringements of Articles 13 and 14 set out in this decision, is so serious that it also infringes Articles 5 (1) a and 5.2. IMY therefore finds that Klarna violates Articles 5 (1) (a), 5 (2), 12 (1) and 13 (2) (a) i the Data Protection Regulation. 2.2.5. IMY's assessment of Klarna's information pursuant to Article 13 (2) (b) Pursuant to Article 13 (2) (b), information shall be provided that there is a right to it personal data controller request access to and correction or deletion of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or that object to processing and the right to data portability. It follows from the Article 29 Working Party's Guideline on Transparency WP260 (pp. 27-28) that Transparency entails three obligations for the person responsible for personal data regarding them data subjects' rights: ""• To inform data subjects of their rights (in accordance with the requirements of Article 13 (2) (b) and 14.2 c)., Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2019-4062 15 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 • To observe the principle of transparency (ie in terms of the quality of communication according to the article 12.1) in communicating with data subjects about their rights under Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34. • To facilitate the exercise of data subjects' rights in accordance with Articles 15 to 22. The requirements of the Data Protection Regulation regarding the exercise of these rights and the type of information required is intended to give the data subjects a significant opportunity to assert their rights and hold the data controllers accountable the processing of their personal data. Recital 59 emphasizes that procedures should: ""which makes it easier for data subjects to exercise their rights"" and that it personal data controllers should also “provide aids for electronically submitted requests, especially in cases where personal data are processed electronically '. That procedure which a personal data controller determines for the data subjects to be able to exercise their rights should be appropriate to the scope and type of the relationship and the interaction that exists between the data controller and the data subject. One The controller may therefore wish to establish one or more different procedures for the exercise of rights which reflect the different ways in which they registered interacts with the personal data controller. "" In addition, the Article 29 Working Party makes the following comments on the information requirement in Guideline WP260 (pp.40-41), concerning Article 13 (2) (b): ""This information should be specific to the treatment in question and include one summary of what the right entails, how the data subject can proceed to exercise it and the limitations to which the right may be subject (see paragraph 68) above). In particular, the right to object to treatment must be expressly notified to it registered at the latest at the first communication with the registered and be reported clearly, clearly and separately from any other information. \[…\] "" IMY notes that there is a special section in the Data Protection Information, Section 10, which is entitled ""Your rights in relation to your personal data"", which in turn to some extent refers to other sections of the Data Protection Information. However, IMY believes that The data protection information provides incomplete information regarding the data subjects rights, in violation of Article 13 (2) (b) of the Data Protection Regulation, as follows. The right to delete Regarding the right to deletion (Article 17), follows from Section 10 of the Data Protection Information “The right to be deleted. You have the right to request deletion of your personal data example when it is no longer necessary to process the data for the purpose they were collected, or if you withdraw your consent. As described in Sections 3 and 9 above, however, Klarna needs to follow certain laws that prevent us from deleting immediately certain information. "" IMY considers that this wording does not summarize the meaning of the right in an open manner way. According to Article 17 of the Data Protection Regulation, the data subject has the right to receive his personal data deleted by the personal data controller, which, however, is not one absolute right. On the one hand, there is an enumeration in the mentioned article regarding in which case the personal data controller is obliged to delete personal data without unnecessary delay, and there are certain exceptions to this obligation for necessary treatment in some cases. It is not clear how this right relates to the right to, Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2019-4062 16 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 object in accordance with Article 21. As the information is worded in The data protection information regarding this right gives it a difficult picture of what the right entails and in which cases it applies. That it refers to the general ones Sections 3 and 9 of the Data Protection Information make it even less clear. IMY assesses that the infringement of Article 13 (2) (b) with regard to the requirement to provide information on the right to deletion, taking into account also other infringements of Articles 13 and 14 which is apparent from this decision, is so serious that it also constitutes a breach of Articles 5.1 (a) and 5.2. IMY further believes that Klarna also does not meet the requirements for completion and clear information as set out in Article 12 (1). IMY therefore considers that the information in this part of the Data Protection Information does not complies with the requirement of transparency, in particular in the light of the above statements in the guidelines on transparency and thus finds that Klarna violates Articles 5.1 a, 5.2, 12.1 and 13.2 b of the Data Protection Regulation. The right to restriction Regarding the right of restriction (Article 18), the IMY finds that it is missing information about this right in the Data Protection Information. In Section 10 i However, the data protection information contains the following information “Right to oppose you processing of your personal data or objecting to our processing. If you considers that your personal data is incorrect or has been processed in violation of applicable law you have the right to ask us to stop the treatment. You can also object to ours treatment when you consider that there are circumstances that prevent the treatment carried out in accordance with applicable rules. Furthermore, you can always object to us using your marketing information. "" IMY considers that the information provided is both incorrect and incomplete in relation how the right is reflected in Article 18 of the Data Protection Regulation. It summarizes thus not the right in a way that enables the data subjects to understand what it means. This in turn makes it difficult for data subjects to exercise their rights. In addition to the information being incomplete, it also involves the right to object certain treatment (marketing), without further developing what this right entails or in which situations it may be invoked (cf. Article 18 (1) (d) and the reference to Article 21 (1)). The IMY considers that the infringement of Article 13 (2) (b) what applies to the requirement for information on the right to restriction, taking into account also other infringements of Articles 13 and 14 set out in this Decision are as follows serious that it also infringes Articles 5 (1) (a) and 5 (2). IMY consider further that Klarna also does not meet the requirements for clear and distinct information that appear of Article 12.1. IMY therefore considers that the information on the right to restriction does not comply with the requirement transparency, in particular in the light of the statements made by the Article 29 Working Party above, and thus finds that Klarna violates Articles 5.1 a, 5.2, 12.1 and 13.2 b i the Data Protection Regulation. The right to data portability Regarding the right to data portability (Article 20), follows from Section 10 of the Data protection information “Right to access your data. You can request a copy of your personal information if you want to know what information we have about you. This copy can also transmitted in a machine-readable format (so-called “data portability”). ”., the Swedish Data Protection Authority. Date: 2022-03-28 IMY does not consider that information about the right has been provided in a transparent manner, then it partly has been included under the right of access even though data portability is a separate right under Article 20 of the Data Protection Regulation, partly because it has not been summarized in one clear way that enables the data subjects to understand what the right entails. According to Article 20, the right is aimed at the data subject being entitled to receive them personal data relating to him or her in a structured, widely used and machine-readable format, and has the right to transfer these to another personal data controller under certain conditions. IMY assesses that the violation of Article 13 (2) (b) as regards the requirement for information on the right to data portability, with account has also been taken of other infringements of Articles 13 and 14 set out in this decision, is so serious that it also infringes Articles 5 (1) a and 5.2. IMY further believes that Klarna also does not meet the requirements for clear and distinct information provided for in Article 12 (1). IMY therefore considers that the information regarding the right to data portability does not complies with the requirement of transparency, in particular in the light of the Article 29 Working Party statements above, and notes that Klarna violates Articles 5.1 a, 5.2, 12.1 and 13.2 b of the Data Protection Regulation. The right to object With regard to the right to object (Article 21), the IMY states that it is missing complete information about this right in the Data Protection Information. In Section 10 i The data protection information contains the following information inserted in the above the information on “Right to oppose the processing of your personal data or object to our treatment ”:“ You can also object to our treatment when you considers that there are circumstances which mean that the treatment is not carried out in accordance with applicable rules."". The following information is also available in Section 10 of Data protection information “Right to object to an automated decision. You are right to object to an automated decision made by Klarna if this decision entails legal consequences or constitutes a decision which in a similar way significantly affects you. See Section 6 above on how Klarna uses this form of automatic decision. ”. In addition, the following information is available in Section 3 of the Data Protection Information, for the purpose of processing personal data for the purpose of performing customer satisfaction surveys about Klarna's services, “You can object to this at any time preferably. You will also receive information on how to unsubscribe from this each once you are contacted for this purpose. "". The following information is also available in Section 6, regarding Klarna's profiling and automated decision-making, “Predict which marketing that may be of interest to you. You can always object to this and unsubscribe from marketing and this profiling, by contacting us. For more information about our processing of personal data to provide marketing see Section 3 above; ”, and“ You always have the right to object to one automated decisions with legal consequences or decisions that are similarly significant degree affects you (along with the coherent profiling) by contact us at the e-mail address in Section 13. An employee at Klarna will come in such cases to look at your case. ”. Under Article 21, the data subject has the right to object in several different situations. It follows from Article 21 (1) that the data subject has the right to object at any time against the processing of personal data relating to him or her on which it is based Article 6 (1) (e) (public interest) or f (legitimate interest / balancing of interests), including profiling based on these provisions. The person responsible for personal data receives, The Swedish Data Protection Agency Record number: DI-2019-4062 18 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 then no longer process the personal data, unless he can prove compelling legitimate reasons for the processing which outweigh the interests of the data subject; rights and freedoms, or whether it is for the determination, exercise or defense of legal claims. IMY states that the Data Protection Information in its entirety lacks information about the law to object to the processing of personal data based on article 6.1 (f) of the Data Protection Regulation, including profiling based on it provision, despite the fact that Klarna for several different treatments, which are described in i Section 3 of the Data Protection Information, states that this is one of the legal bases that applied and that profiling takes place. The profiling is developed in more detail in Section 6 in The data protection information, but even there there is no information about the right to object pursuant to Article 21 (1). The IMY considers that the infringement of Article 13 (2) (b) with regard to the requirement of information on the right to object, taking into account others as well infringements of Articles 13 and 14 set out in this Decision are so serious that it also infringes Articles 5 (1) (a) and 5 (2). IMY further considers that Klarna also does not meet the requirements for clear and unambiguous information set out in the article 12.1. IMY therefore considers that the information regarding the right to object in The data protection information does not comply with the requirement of transparency and thus states that Klarna violates Articles 5.1 a, 5.2, 12.1 and 13.2 b of the Data Protection Regulation. 2.2.6. IMY's assessment of Klarna's information pursuant to Article 13 (2) (f) and (2) (g) According to Articles 13 (2) (f) and 14 (2) (g), information shall be provided on the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling in accordance with Article 22 (1) and (4), whereby at least in these cases, meaningful information about the logic behind it should be provided as well the significance and the foreseeable consequences of such processing for the data subject. Applicable regulation The Article 29 Working Party's guide WP260 (pp. 22-23) states that information on the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, in accordance with Article 22 (1) and 22.4, as well as meaningful information about the logic behind and the meaning and those the foreseeable consequences of the processing for the data subject, form part of it mandatory information that must be provided to the data subject in accordance with Article 13 (2) (f) and 14.2 g. The Article 29 Working Party has in the guidelines WP251 on automated individual decision-making and profiling described how openness should be applied precisely in question about profiling. WP251 (p. 10) emphasizes the following: The profiling process is usually not visible to the registered person. The process is done in this way that derived or derived data is created about individuals. These are ""new"" personal data that has not been provided directly by the data subjects. Individuals have different degrees of understanding how the process goes and can have a hard time understanding the complex techniques used in profiling and automated decision making. According to Article 12 (1), the controller shall provide the data subjects concise, clear and unambiguous, comprehensible and easily accessible information on the treatment of their personal data., Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2019-4062 19 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 According to Article 22 (1), the data subject shall have the right not to be the subject of a decision which: based solely on automated processing, including profiling which has legal consequences for him or her or similarly significantly affect him or her or her. Such automated decision-making is only allowed if one of them exceptions provided for in Article 22 (2) exist. Exceptions are made in that case decision-making is necessary for the conclusion or performance of an agreement between it registered and the data controller or permitted under Union law or a national law of the Member State to which the controller is subject and which lays down appropriate measures to protect the data subject's rights, freedoms and legitimate interests or is based on the express consent of the data subject. The following is emphasized in WP251 (p. 17): Given that the central principle behind the Data Protection Regulation is transparency personal data controllers must ensure that they explain in a clear and unambiguous manner individual how profiling or automated decision making works. Especially if the treatment involves decision-making based on profiling (whether or not the treatment is subject to the provisions of Article 22) clarify to the data subject that the processing concerns both a) profiling and b) decision-making based on the profile created. Recital 60 states that the provision of profiling information is included in it the transparency obligations of the controller pursuant to Article 5 (1) (a). The data subject has the right to information from the personal data controller about ""profiling"", and in some case the right to object to ""profiling"", regardless of whether it is only automated individual decision-making based on profiling. The data subject's right to information under Articles 13 (2) (f) and 14 (2) (g) is dealt with in WP251 (p. 26): Given the potential risks to data subjects' rights and the conclusions which can be deduced from the profiling covered by Article 22 should personal data controllers pay special attention to their obligation to ensure transparency in treatment. According to Articles 13 (2) (f) and 14 (2) (g), personal data controllers shall: provide readily available information on established automated decision-making only on automated processing, including profiling, which has legal or on similarly significant consequences. If the person responsible for personal data understands automated decisions under Article 22 (1), he must  tell the data subject that they apply this method;  provide meaningful information about the underlying logic and  explain the significance and the foreseen consequences of the treatment. The provision of this information also helps data controllers to ensure that they comply with some of the mandatory safeguards set out in Article 22 (3) and recital 71. If the automated decision-making and profiling is not covered by the definition in Article 22 (1), it is nevertheless good practice to provide the above information. In which In any case, the controller must provide sufficient information to the data subject so that the processing is considered fair and fulfills all others information requirements in Articles 13 and 14., Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2019-4062 20 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 … The data controller should try to explain in a simple way the logic behind, or the criteria for arriving at, the decision. In the Data Protection Ordinance, it is imposed personal data controller to provide meaningful information about the logic behind processing, not necessarily a complex explanation of the algorithms used or to disclose the complete algorithm. The information provided should however, be comprehensive enough for the data subject to understand the reasons for the decision. Klarnas Data Protection Information Section 6 of Klarnas Data Protection Information states the following: Decisions with legal consequences or decisions that in a similar way significantly affect you Automated decisions with legal consequences or automated decisions as on similar ways significantly affect you means that certain decisions in our Services exclusively taken automatically, without the involvement of our employees, and may have significant effect on you as a customer, comparable to legal consequences. By grasping such decisions automatically increase Klarna objectivity and transparency in decisions when we offers these Services. We use this type of automated decision making when we:  Decides to approve your application to use a Service such as includes credit;  Decides not to approve your application to use a Service as includes credit;  Decides whether you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, if ours treatment shows that your behavior indicates money laundering or fraudulent behavior, that your behavior is not consistent with previous use of our Services, or that you have attempted to conceal your true identity. IN relevant cases, Klarna also investigates whether specific customers are listed on sanction lists. See Section 3 for more information on which categories of personal data are processed for these purposes. Section 3 provides the following information regarding the data protection information credit assessment (purpose, categories of data, basis for personal data processing): Perform credit check before credit Follow the law, when the credit Contact and in question are regulated by law. granted (See Section 4.1 on Klarna's identification information, For those cases the credit Services that involve credit provided and Section 7.4 on how we financial information and is not regulated by law information on how to perform the treatment collaborates with interacts with Klarna. to be able to fulfill credit bureaus). credit agreement., Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2019-4062 21 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 In its reply to IMY on 26 April 2019, Klarna has specified which categories of information processed in connection with automated decisions, including profiling for credit review purposes: Information collected from the consumer himself or generated by Klarna  Personal and contact information (such as name, address, social security number / date of birth and e-mail address) Source: provided consumer when buying.  Information about how the consumer has interacted with Klarna (for example outstanding debt, if the consumer has chosen to block himself from Klarnas services or have been suspended due to abuse). Source: Consumer previous relationship with Klarna.  Klarna's internal credit score (which is reported in answer 4 above).  Confirmation from Klarna's internal fraud check (i.e. ""yes"", ""no"" or ""Additional verification required""). Source: The consumer's previous relationship with Clear, information provided by consumers at the time of purchase, or collected by Clear in connection with these. Data collected from external suppliers  Personal and contact information (external verification of the consumer and his address, as well as external information about the owner of the telephone number as provided). Source: External supplier  Financial information (external credit information, such as income, payment remarks or debt restructuring) Source: External supplier.  Confirmation from Klarna's internal fraud check (i.e. ""yes"", ""no"" or ""Additional verification required""). Source: External supplier. IMY's assessment IMY states that Klarnas Dataskyddsinformation lacks meaningful information about the logic behind as well as the significance and the anticipated consequences of such treatment for the registered. The Data Protection Information only shows that certain types of information is used in connection with the automated decision (Contact and identification information, financial information and information on how to interact with Klarna). It is not clear that Klarna uses its own internal scoring model based on other on both internal and external financial information or the types of information included in the financial information, for example information on debts of others lender. No information is given about what circumstances may be of crucial for a negative credit decision. IMY believes that the requirement to provide meaningful information about the logic behind one automated credit decision includes information about which categories of information are of crucial in the context of an internal scoring model and the possible existence of conditions that always lead to a rejection decision within the framework of the decision support it personal data controller uses., Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2019-4062 22 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 IMY does not consider that the information on automated credit decisions is provided in one easily accessible way. The individual consumer should be provided with this type of difficult-to-understand information in one context instead of disseminated in different places in The data protection information. IMY believes that the information that Klarna provides about the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling in accordance with Article 22 (1) and (4) (i) the Data Protection Regulation, making it meaningful at least in these cases information about the logic behind it and the significance and the anticipated consequences of such processing for the data subject does not meet the requirements of Articles 13 (2) (f) and 14 (2) (g). The information is not concise, clear and distinct, nor is it easily accessible. It meets thus not the requirements of Article 12 (1). The IMY considers that the infringement of Articles 13 (2) (f) and 14 (2) (g), taking into account to other infringements of Articles 13 and 14 set out in this Decision, is so serious that it also infringes Articles 5 (1) (a) and 5 (2). IMY therefore finds that Klarna violates Articles 5.1 a, 5.2, 12.1, 13.2 f and 14.2 g of the Data Protection Regulation. 3 Choice of intervention 3.1 Legal regulation In the event of violations of the Data Protection Regulation, the IMY has a number of corrections powers, including reprimand, injunction and penalty fees. It follows Article 58 (2) (a) to (j) of the Data Protection Regulation. IMY shall impose penalty fees in addition to or in lieu of other corrective actions referred to in Article 58 (2), depending on the circumstances of each case. If a personal data controller or a personal data assistant, with respect to a and the same or interconnected data processing, intentionally or by negligence violates several of the provisions of this Regulation may it the total amount of the administrative penalty fee does not exceed the amount determined for the most serious infringement. It is clear from Article 83 (3) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty fees in each individual case are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The provided for in Article 83 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. Article 83 (2) sets out the factors to be taken into account when deciding on an administrative penalty fee shall be imposed, but also what shall affect the penalty fee size. 3.2 Penalty fee Klarna provides payment solutions to about 90 million consumers and more than 200,000 stores in 17 countries. Klarna provides several different services that are important for the financial system, such as direct payment, various forms of “try first and pay later ”services and installments. To be able to provide these services must Ready to process a very large amount of personal data. IMY has above assessed that, The Swedish Privacy Protection Agency Record number: DI-2019-4062 23 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 Klarna has not fulfilled the basic principle of openness and they data rights of data subjects. Klarna has violated Articles 5 (1) (a), 5.2, 12.1, 13.1 c, e-f and 13.2 a-b, f and 14.2 g in the Data Protection Regulation. IMY consider not that it is a question of less serious infringements. Klarna must therefore be applied administrative penalty fees for the said infringements. IMY believes that the disclosure of information takes place via Klarnas Data protection information is one and the same data processing and that a common sanction amounts shall be determined for these. IMY states that Klarna has violated several articles covered by Article 83 (5), which means that a higher penalty amount can applied. As regards the calculation of the amount, Article 83 (5) of the Data Protection Regulation states that companies that commit infringements on which the relevant ones can be fined up to twenty million euros or four percent of total global annual sales during the previous financial year, whichever is higher. When determining the maximum amount for a penalty fee to be imposed on a company the definition of the term company used by the European Court of Justice should be used application of Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU (see recital 150 i the Data Protection Regulation). It is clear from the case - law of the Court that this covers every unit engaging in economic activities, regardless of the legal form of the entity and the manner in which it operates financing and even if the entity in the legal sense consists of several physical or legal entities. IMY assesses that the company's turnover is to be used as a basis for calculating the administrative sanction fees that can be imposed on Klarna are Klarna's parent company Klarna Holding AB. Klarna Holding AB's annual report for the year 2020 states that annual sales in 2020 were approximately SEK 10,093,659,000. The highest penalty amount which can be determined in the case is four percent of this amount, that is to say approx SEK 404,000,000. In determining the size of the penalty fee, IMY takes into account that Klarna is one multinational company that processes personal data of a large number of registrants. Klarna processes many different categories of personal data where the data in some cases refers to financial circumstances and the creditworthiness of the data subject. IMY believes that high demands must be placed on a large company with such a comprehensive and privacy-sensitive personal data processing to provide information that is concise, clear and distinct, comprehensible and in easily accessible form. In aggravating direction speaks that there have been violations concerning articles that are central so that the data subject has the opportunity to exercise his or her rights under the Data Protection Regulation and that the information provided in The data protection information concerns a very large number of registered and that the infringement has been going on for a long time. As a mitigating circumstance, it is taken into account that Klarna has changed during the supervision and improved the information in the Data Protection Information. In view of the seriousness of the infringements and the administrative penalty fee shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, the IMY determines the administrative the sanction fee for Klarna Bank AB to SEK 7,500,000., The Swedish Data Protection Agency Record number: DI-2019-4062 24 (25) Date: 2022-03-28 This decision was made by Director General Lena Lindgren Schelin after the presentation by the department director Hans Kärnlöf.

I hereby consent to the processing of personal data within The Bonnier Group.” In its statement to IMY, Bonnier Magazines and Brands has stated that the information in the registration flow in the company's webshop, Magasinshoppen, was accidentally not updated in the same way as on other web pages. In accordance with the data protection regulation coming into force in 2018, Bonnier Magazine and Brands AB carried out an extensive work which meant, among other things, that the company reassessed its legal basis for Processing of personal data. Instead of consent, Bonnier Magazine founded and Brands AB's processing of customers' personal data mainly on legal grounds Postal address: the grounds in Article 6.1 b of the Data Protection Regulation, agreement, or in Article 6.1 f i Box 8114 data protection regulation, legitimate interest. In the normal registration flow that 104 20 Stockholm is used on Bonnier Magazine and Brands AB's web pages, the customer is asked to Website: agree to the subscription terms and confirm that he has taken part in Bonnier www.imy.se Magazine and Brands AB's data protection policy. Bonnier Magazines and Brands AB has E-mail: stated that immediately when IMY started the supervision measures were taken to imy@imy.se update the Magasinshoppen with correct information in the registration flow. Phone: 08-657 61 00 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6523 2(3) Date: 2023-06-26 Bonnier Magazines and Brands AB has been dissolved by merger on June 1, 2022 and joined Expressen Lifestyle AB (556025-4525). Justification of the decision Of ch. 23 Section 1 of the Companies Act (2005:551) follows that the effects of a merger mean that all assets and liabilities are taken over by another company at the time of the merger. The The acquiring company is therefore responsible for the obligations that existed in the company that taken over. In light of this, IMY makes the assessment that the acquiring company after the time of the merger is a party to IMY's supervision matter and this supervision is therefore aimed at against Expressen Lifestyle AB. When a personal data controller collects personal data from a registered person shall information regarding the legal basis for the processing appears, according to Article 13.1 c in the data protection regulation. The person in charge of personal data must, according to Article 12.1 i data protection regulation take measures to provide this to the data subject information in a concise, clear and clear, comprehensible and easily accessible form, with the use of clear and unambiguous language. IMY considers that the text next to the checkbox on the company's website ""I accept the subscription terms. I hereby agree personal data processing within the Bonnier Group"", gives the registered impression that the company's legal basis for processing personal data is consent according to article 6.1. a in the data protection regulation. The information text that was under the link with the text of the subscription terms further reinforces this through wording ""When ordering, you agree that your personal data including email address, mobile number for calls and text messages and any other digital addresses, may be stored and used within Bonnier for digital services, marketing, as well as for statistical and analysis purposes.”. Furthermore, information is provided in the same place about the terms of consent including the right to withdraw consent. The company has stated that the company does not base its processing on customers' personal data on consent but mainly on the legal grounds agreement or justified interest according to Article 6.1 b and f of the data protection regulation. Against this background, IMY notes that the company has processed personal data in violation of Article 13.1 c of the Data Protection Regulation by stating the wrong legal basis for the processing of data subjects' personal data. Choice of intervention From article 58.2 and article 83.2 of the data protection regulation, it appears that IMY has power to impose administrative penalty charges in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, the administrative sanction fees are imposed in addition to or instead of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2), which for example injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83.2 states which factors which must be taken into account when deciding whether administrative penalty charges must be imposed and at determining the size of the fee. If it is a question of a minor violation, IMY gets as set out in recital 148 instead of imposing a penalty charge issue one reprimand according to article 58.2 b. Consideration must be given to aggravating and mitigating factors circumstances of the case, such as the nature, severity and duration of the infringement as well as previous violations of relevance. IMY notes the following relevant circumstances. Bonnier Magazines and Brands AB immediately took measures when IMY began its supervision to update the Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6523 3(3) Date: 2023-06-26 the information in the registration flow on its website so that it registered accordingly neither met with a consent request nor informational text about consent. Instead the data subject is asked to accept the subscription terms (ie the terms of purchase) and confirm that he has read the company's data protection policy. The website has not been the page through which most of the company's customers signed their subscriptions. The use of the web shop has therefore been limited, which is why only 1372 customers signed their subscriptions via this website during the current time period. Further where it was a mistake that the website was not updated in connection with the company's review its routines in connection with the entry into force of the data protection association. IMY assesses that the shortcoming in question did not have serious consequences for the data subjects. Against this one background, IMY assesses that it is a question of such a minor violation in that sense which is referred to in reason 148 which results in Expressen Lifestyle AB being given a reprimand according to article 58.2 b of the data protection regulation for the identified deficiency. This decision has been taken by the unit manager Catharina Fernquist after a presentation by lawyer Ulrika Bergström.

The Privacy Protection Authority further notes that Spotify AB during the period from and with June 11, 2019 through May 16, 2022 by default do not provide the description of the data in the technical log files in English has met the requirements that all communications provided to the data subject pursuant to Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation shall be clear and understandable in the manner specified in article 12.1 of the data protection regulation. Spotify AB has thus processed personal data in violation of articles 12.1, 15.1 a-d, 15.1 g and 15.2 of the data protection regulation. The Privacy Protection Authority decides with the support of articles 58.2 and 83 i the data protection regulation that Spotify AB must pay an administrative fee for these shortcomings sanction fee of 58,000,000 (fifty-eight million) kroner.

The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 4(30) Date: 2023-06-12 - articles 15.1 a-h and 15.2 of the data protection regulation, by not having provided any of the information specified in these regulations. The Swedish Data Protection Authority gives Spotify AB a reprimand according to article 58.2 b i the data protection regulation for the deficiencies regarding complaints 1 and 2. The Swedish Privacy Protection Authority orders Spotify AB according to article 58.2 c in the data protection regulation that regarding complaint 2 no later than one month after this decision gained legal force accommodate the appellant's request for access by, with subject to any applicable exceptions in Article 15.4 of the Data Protection Regulation and 5 ch. data protection law, give the complainant access to all personal data that Spotify will process the complainant by providing the complainant with a copy of the personal data according to 15.3 and provide information according to articles 15.1 a-h and 15.2. 2 3 The complainant's identification information appears in Appendix 1 The Act (2018:218) with supplementary provisions to the EU's data protection regulation. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 5(30) Date: 2023-06-12 1 Description of the supervisory matter The Swedish Data Protection Authority (IMY) has, in the light of IMY having taken note of complaints directed against Spotify AB (Spotify) regarding the right of access pursuant to Article 15 i data protection regulation, initiated supervision of Spotify with the aim of investigating the company's way of handling the data subject's request for access is in accordance with the data protection regulation regulations. IMY has initially reviewed the company's general procedures upon request about access and not what existed in the individual complaints. The review has been focused on whether the company's processes and routines to provide access according to article 15 on a general level enables data subjects to gain access to the personal data the company processes them and other information according to the provision. With registered refers in this context to the customers who use Spotify's services and not other categories of data subjects, e.g. employees of Spotify. Within the scope of this review, IMY has not checked which personal data Spotify processes and if all of these are issued with each individual request. For example has any comparison between Spotify's records of processing pursuant to Article 30 i the data protection regulation and the personal data included in the copy of personal data according to Article 15.3 of the data protection regulation has not been done. IMY also does not have within the framework for this supervision reviewed whether Spotify's personal data processing otherwise complies the provisions of the data protection regulation, e.g. regarding basic principles and legal basis for the processing. The supervisory case was initiated with a supervisory letter on 11 June 2019. Response to the supervisory letter was received on July 31, 2019. On October 16, 2019, a request was sent about completion in the case. Answer received on November 15, 2019. Spotify has subsequently on his own initiative received further additions on 25 August 2020 for the purpose to inform IMY of updates regarding procedures for handling requests for access. Spotify is an organization with operations and users in several EU member states. In consideration of the fact that the case is cross-border, IMY has applied the mechanisms for cooperation and uniformity found in Chapter VII of the Data Protection Regulation. Every data protection authorities in the EU have been concerned supervisory authorities in this case. With reason for the mechanisms of cooperation and uniformity, and the need for a 4 harmonized complaint handling within the EU, the IMY extended in November 2020 the ongoing general supervision to also include what existed in three individuals complaints, which also include the complaints that were initially the basis for the supervision of the general routines. On November 5, 2020, IMY requested that Spotify explain its approach to them deficiencies alleged in the complaints and what steps Spotify has taken to respond on the respective request for access. Spotify has responded to IMY's request on 18 December 2020. Spotify has subsequently submitted supplementary statements, on 15 April 2021 in response to supplementary questions that IMY asked on March 24, 2021 as well as on 31 August 2021 in response to questions raised by IMY on 9 July 2021. 4 In 2020, the data protection authorities worked together to determine common working methods with the handling of complaints, which resulted in internal guidance that was established in February 2021. From that end the complaints with a standard response, IMY now makes an individual assessment of each complaint. Internal EDPB Document 02/2021 on SA's duties in relation to alleged GDPR infringements, adopted February 2, 2021. Data Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 6(30) Date: 2023-06-12 On October 19, 2021, another request for completion was sent regarding Spotify's general procedures. Answer received on 12 November 2021. On 8 June and 17 In October 2022, Spotify has, on its own initiative, submitted further additions in purpose of informing IMY about updates regarding routines for handling the request about access. Spotify has commented on IMY's draft decision on 20 December 2022. IMY has then provided the other relevant supervisory authorities with the opportunity to comment accordingly Article 60 of the Data Protection Regulation. The French data protection authority has thereby expressed a relevant and reasoned objection to IMY's draft decision. Spotify has on March 13, 2023, an opportunity has been prepared to comment on the objection and IMY's revised draft decision. Spotify's response was received on April 11, 2023. Against the background of the above, the supervisory case includes an examination of Spotify's general routines for handling requests for access, partly a review of what existed in the three complaints. The general routines regarding the provision of personal data according to article 15.1 and 15.3 of the data protection regulation which reviewed are those that have been in force since IMY's supervision began on 11 June 2019 up to and including 16 May 2022. Regarding the information according to Article 15.1 and 15.2 of the data protection regulation that must be provided when a request for access has Spotify updated it several times since supervision began. IMY has therefore limited its review to the information that was valid during the period from 16 November 2021 through May 16, 2022. 5 2 Applicable regulations According to Article 15.1 of the data protection regulation, the data subject has the right to of it personal data controller receive confirmation as to whether personal data concerning him or her is being processed and in that case gain access to the personal data and information about a) The purposes of the processing. b) The categories of personal data to which the processing applies. c) The recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data has provided or to be provided, especially recipients in third countries and international organizations. d) If possible, the anticipated period during which the personal data will stored, or if this is not possible, the criteria used to determine this period. e) The existence of the right to request correction from the personal data controller or deletion of the personal data or restrictions on processing of personal data relating to the data subject or to object to such treatment. f) The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. g) If the personal data is not collected from the data subject, all available information about where this data comes from. h) The existence of automated decision-making including profiling according to article 22.1 and 22.4, whereby at least in these cases it must be left meaningful 5See Spotify's information according to Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation in Appendix 2. Of the information, which was printed by IMY on 16 May 2022, it appears that the current website was last updated on 16 November 2021. The time period for the review is therefore set for the period from and including November 16, 2021 to and including May 16, 2022. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 7(30) Date: 2023-06-12 information about the logic behind as well as the meaning and the anticipated consequences of such treatment for the data subject. Article 15.2 of the data protection regulation states that if the personal data is transferred to a third country or to an international organisation, the data subject shall have the right to information on the appropriate protective measures that have been taken in accordance with Article 46 at the time of transfer. It follows from Article 15.3 of the data protection regulation that the person in charge of personal data must provide the data subject with a copy of the personal data that is being processed. Furthermore, it appears that if the request is made in electronic form, the information must, if not otherwise requested, provided in an electronic format that is generally used. Recital 63 of the data protection regulation states, as far as relevant, the following: The data subject should have the right to access personal data that has been collected this as well as being able to exercise this right in a simple way and at reasonable intervals, for to be aware that treatment is taking place and to be able to check that it is legal. (…) All data subjects should therefore have the right to be informed and notified above all, for what purposes the personal data is processed, if possible which time period the processing is in progress, who receives the personal data, underlying logic in connection with automatic processing of personal data and, at least when the processing is based on profiling, the consequences of such treatment. (…) It also follows from Article 12.1 of the data protection regulation that it personal data controller must take appropriate measures to ensure that all communications given to the registered under Article 15 must be in a concise, clear and clear, understandable and easily accessible form, using clear and unambiguous language. It follows from Article 12.2 of the data protection regulation that the person in charge of personal data must facilitate the exercise of the data subject's right of access under Article 15. According to Article 12.3 of the Data Protection Regulation, the personal data controller must request, without undue delay and in any case no later than one month after having received the request, provide the registered information about the actions which was taken in accordance with Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation. This period may if necessary be extended by a further two months, taking into account the complexity of the request and the number of requests received. The personal data controller must notify it registered for such an extension within one month of the receipt of the request and state the reasons for the delay. 3 Spotify's general procedures for handling request for access - Justification of decision 3.1 Information - article 15.1 a-h and 15.2 i data protection regulation 3.1.1 What emerged in the matter In summary, Spotify has stated the following. Spotify provides information in in accordance with article 15.1 a-h and 15.2 of the data protection regulation via an online function. This function is available in 21 different languages and those who visit the page will The Danish Data Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 8(30) Date: 2023-06-12 automatically to be given the information in language based on language settings in their browser. Registrants who exercise their right of access are informed about the function in several ways. IN each copy of personal data provided pursuant to Article 15.3 i data protection regulation, a link to the information is included. The information also goes to find online, partly in the list of available functions on the company's page for ""Integrity & Security"" partly via the answer to the question ""Where can I find information about Spotify's processing of personal data that Spotify is obliged to provide under Article 15 of the GDPR?” on the company's page for ""Personal data rights and privacy settings"". In the information according to Article 15 of the data protection regulation that Spotify submitted the period from and including 16 November 2021 to and including 16 May 2022, as IMY taken note of, Spotify provided, among other things, information about the purpose of treatment (article 15.1 a), which categories of personal data are processed (Article 15.1 b), recipients or categories of recipients (Article 15.1 c) and the source of the personal data (Article 15.1 g). In addition to that, the information according to Article 15 also contained information about international transfers (Article 15.2), criteria for how long the personal data saved (Article 15.1 d), what rights the data subject has (Article 15.1 e), the right to submit a complaint to the data protection authority (Article 15.1 f), automated decision-making (Article 15.1 h) and the possibility of obtaining a copy of personal data. In the information pursuant to Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation, Spotify also informed that the processing of personal data is described in more detail in the company's privacy policy, which could also be accessed through a direct link. In the privacy policy can be found including descriptions of the categories of personal data that Spotify processes. Spotify has stated that all questions that are not answered by the information according to Article 15 i the data protection regulation or which has not been explained to the user in one satisfactory manner is promptly escalated to the company's data protection team. In that way, the company states, the data protection team is made aware of, and given the opportunity to respond, questions about clarifications or requests for more individualized information about the processing of personal data according to Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation. 3.1.2 The Privacy Protection Authority's assessment IMY states that Spotify's function for information according to Article 15 i the data protection regulation during the period that is the subject of review existed available on several different pages on Spotify's website. Furthermore, a link to was included the information in the ""Read me first"" file that was attached to each copy of personal data which was provided to the data subject in accordance with Article 15.3 i the data protection regulation in case of a request for access. IMY assesses with that in mind above that Spotify's routines during the relevant period were sufficient to ensure that information according to Article 15 was provided to the data subject at each access request. IMY further notes that Spotify's information according to Article 15 i the data protection regulation covered all the points of information that according to article 15.1 a-h and 15.2 of the data protection regulation must be provided to the data subject. For that the information must meet the requirements set in the data protection regulation must 6 See appendix 2 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 9(30) Date: 2023-06-12 however, the information is also designed in such a way that the purpose of the right of access is fulfilled. The purpose of the right of access is for the data subject to be aware that processing takes place and be able to check that it is legal, which is evident from reason 63 to data protection regulation. For example, a registered person must be able to check which categories of data are processed about him or her, for which purposes and for how long. So that the registered person can check if the processing of personal data is legal, he or she must know which treatments are are relevant in his or her specific case. The information provided must hereunder provided in a manner that meets the requirements for transparency in Article 12.1 i data protection regulation. Against the background of the purpose of the right of access, there is often a need to adapt the content of the information according to Article 15.1 and 15.2 i the data protection regulation to the data subject who has made the request, for example depending on which of the personal data controller's services the data subject has chosen to use. However, this does not apply to all parts of the information. While the right to enter complaints to a supervisory authority (Article 15.1 f of the Data Protection Regulation) not changes depending on who requests access, other information may vary depending on which service the data subject uses, for example which categories of personal data processed, recipient and from where personal data was collected. The same applies to information about whether a transfer has taken place to a third country and if so what appropriate protective measures have been taken during the transfer. In order for the data subject to have the opportunity to check that the processing concerns him or her is legal it is therefore required, in accordance with what is stated above, that Spotify must have taken measures to adapt the information to that of the registrant 7 specific situation. IMY notes that the information provided by Spotify pursuant to Article 15 i the data protection regulation was generally designed. The same information was thus provided regardless of who requested access in accordance with Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation. The information was thus not adapted based on each request for access. However described Spotify when certain information was relevant for the data subject, for example ""If you use a third-party service (…)"", ""If you choose to pay for a service or function via invoice (…)” and “In cases where you have given us permission (…)”. There was thereby certain prerequisites for the data subject to determine which information meant him or her. There was also an opportunity for registrants to apply to Spotify and request more individualized information as well as clarification of it information that had been provided. IMY considers that such generally designed information may be suitable for standardized services that include personal data processing. Because they data subjects must understand how their personal data is processed, however, it must always be possible to clearly and simply read out which information is applicable in which situations based on the information provided. This means that the possibility for those registered to turn to Spotify for more individualized information as well as clarifications does not affect the assessment of whether the information here is sufficiently clear the respect. Generally designed information must not entail any ambiguities regarding 7 See the European Data Protection Board's (EDPB) guidelines on the right of access - Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights – Right of access, version 2.0 (finally adopted on 28 March 2023), paragraph 113. 8 See appendix 2 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 10(30) Date: 2023-06-12 whether the data subject is affected by the current information or not based on his individual situation. IMY therefore has to test the information that Spotify submitted met these requirements. Information on categories of personal data, purpose, recipient and source Information about the purpose of the processing must refer to the purposes for which it is data subject's personal data is actually processed, and must not consist of only one enumeration of various purposes without clarifying which purposes are relevant the person requesting access. Furthermore, information about the categories of personal data which are processed need to be adapted to the circumstances of the data subject who requests access. With regard to information about recipients or categories of recipients, such should information be as specific as possible. The data controller should normally state to which actual recipients the personal data has or is to be disclosed, if it is not impossible because, for example, there is no information yet about who the recipients are. In addition, all available information must be provided about where from the personal data will, if the personal data has not been collected from it 9 registered. Regarding the information provided by Spotify about the purpose of the processing, recipient of personal data and source from which the data was collected states IMY that the information was divided based on different categories of personal data. These categories of personal data consisted of ""user data"", ""usage data"", ""data on plan verification"", ""voting data"", ""payment and purchase data"" and ""competition, survey and lottery data”. The categories of personal data specified were generally held and contained none in several cases, for example regarding ""user data"" and ""usage data"". more detailed description of which personal data could be included. IMY believes that, especially in the absence of a clear description of the relevant categories, was not possible for the data subjects to, based on the information provided, understand which personal data which were included in the various categories. Because the information on purpose, recipient and source was divided according to these categories of personal data entails this lack that it was also not possible for data subjects to easily understand which personal data processed for which purposes, which personal data taken from which source or which personal data was provided to a particular recipient or category of recipients. Those registered have thus not had the opportunity to read out in which way their personal data was processed. IMY therefore believes that Spotify has not provided sufficiently clear information about the purposes with the processing (Article 15.1 a of the data protection regulation), the categories of personal data processing applies (Article 15.1 b of the data protection regulation), recipients or categories of recipients (Article 15.1 c of the data protection regulation) or source from which the data was collected (Article 15.1 g of the Data Protection Regulation). The information was not concise, clear and clear, nor was it easily accessible. The thus also did not meet the requirements of Article 12.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. Information on storage period Information provided about how long personal data is stored must be sufficient specific so that the data subject understands how long his personal data will last to be stored. If it is not possible to specify the time of deletion, the relevant one should be used instead 9 Cf. the European Data Protection Board's (EDPB) guidelines on the right of access - Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights – Right of access, version 2.0 (adopted on 28 March 2023), paragraphs 114-120 and judgment of 12 January 2023 in EU- court case C-154/21, Österreichische Post.Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten Diary number: DI-2019-6696 11(30) Date: 2023-06-12 the event affecting conservation is specified, such as the expiration of a warranty period. The storage periods shall refer to the personal data that is linked the data subject requesting access. If this personal data is subject to different storage periods, information about the storage periods must be specified in relation to each current personal data processing and category of personal data. 10 Spotify provided information about storage periods under the heading ""Criteria for retention of personal data”. The information contained general information about for which purposes the personal data is saved and criteria used to determine the storage periods. Among other things, it was stated that personal data as standard is retained for 90 days, unless a longer period is chosen due to a legitimate business reason. Furthermore, it was stated, among other things, that personal data is stored for a suitable period in order to deliver a personalized service over time and that streaming history is usually preserved during lifetime of an account. The information on how long data is kept was generally designed and, with exception, among other things, for the information about streaming history, not clearly linked to which categories of personal data were intended by the different storage times. The registrants could therefore find it difficult to decipher which of their personal data was preserved for what period of time. The criteria for determining the storage period which were stated in the information were furthermore in some cases very imprecise. It is for example difficult for a data subject to understand what was included in ""legitimate business reason"" and thus in which situations personal data was kept longer than 90 days or whatever meant that streaming history was ""usually"" preserved for the lifetime of an account. In an overall assessment, IMY considers that the information provided regarding storage periods did not meet the requirements in Article 15.1 d of the data protection regulation partly then the information in this part was generally designed and lacked connection to current category of personal data, partly then some of the criteria used to determining the storage period was too imprecise for the data subject to understand how long his personal data was stored. The information was not concise, clear and clear and also not easily accessible. It therefore also did not meet the requirements of the article 12.1 of the data protection regulation. Information on third country transfer In order for the registered person to be able to assess a possible transfer of his personal data to third countries is legal, the data subject must get meaningful information that makes it possible to find out whether his personal data has been transferred and if so, what safeguards have been used. To enable it was registered checking whether his or her personal data has been processed legally, it should i 11 it will normally also be clear to which third countries the transfer has taken place. In the information provided by Spotify regarding transfers to third countries it was clear under the heading ""International transfers"" that Spotify can share personal data globally with other Spotify Group companies, service providers, partners, etc. Further stated that Spotify ensures that the transfer is carried out in accordance with the applicable data protection and privacy laws and that technical and organizational measures, and i in particular, appropriate protective measures are applied, e.g. the standard contract clauses which 10 European Data Protection Board (EDPB) guidelines on the right of access - Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights – Right of access, version 2.0 (finally adopted on 28 March 2023), paragraph 118. 11 Cf the Article 29 Group's Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, WP260rev.01, adopted by European Data Protection Agency, p.40. Data Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 12(30) Date: 2023-06-12 approved by the European Commission when personal data is transferred from European economic cooperation area (EEA). IMY states that the information provided by Spotify regarding third country transfers was generally designed and not linked to the registered own situation. It was not clear whether the data subject's personal data had transferred to any third country, and if so, what appropriate safeguards were in place taken at the time of transfer. It was also not clear to which third countries the transfer had happened. IMY therefore assesses that the information provided regarding third country transfers did not meet the requirements of Article 15.2 of the Data Protection Regulation. The information was not concise, clear and clear, nor was it easily accessible. The thus also did not meet the requirements of Article 12.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. Summary assessment of the information according to Article 15.1 and 15.2 i data protection regulation In summary, IMY finds that the information provided by Spotify according to article 15.1 and 15.2 of the data protection regulation during the period between 16 November 2021 up to and including 16 May 2022 has been deficient in the above-mentioned respects. Spotify has thus processed personal data in violation of articles 12.1, 15.1 a-d, 15.1 g and 15.2 of the data protection regulation. 3.2 The right to access personal data and a copy of personal data under processing – article 15.1 and 15.3 i data protection regulation 3.2.1 What has emerged in the case Spotify has stated that their response to access requests, with a few exceptions, is designed to disclose all personal data that they process regarding it registered. The company has further explained its routines to ensure that all personal data is disclosed, for example when new or updated personal data processing. The copy of personal data provided by Spotify in accordance with Article 15.3 i the data protection regulation can be given through three different answers, Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3. The personal data covered by Type 1 is profile information and the personal data which Spotify has deemed to be of greatest interest to those registered. In Type 1 is included therefore, it recorded playlists, streaming history and recent searches the year, objects saved in the registrant's library, the number of followers of the registrant has, the number of users the registrant follows, the names of artists the registrant follows, user data and payment information. To give the registrant access to Type 1 information, the company has introduced a function called ""download your data"" on a privacy settings web page. The web page through which the data subject can access to this information is available to all customers via their Spotify account and provided in the same language as their Spotify service. Those registered may access to the Type 1 information within about seven days. Those registered can also get access to the Type 1 information by contacting Spotify's customer service. Type 2 information consists of technical log files that are stored in Spotify's system linked to the data subject's user ID. To access the Type 2 information the data subject can send a request via Spotify's web form for privacy issues or by contacting customer service or Spotify's data protection officer through someone Date: 2023-06-12 other channel (email, Facebook, Twitter or letter). It takes about two to four weeks to compile and disclose this personal data. Type 3 information consists of the information that a registered person specifically requests and can for example, refer to the data subject's listening history on a particular date, an extended listening history or a request for unstructured personal data, for example a request for certain email correspondence. Type 3 information can be requested on the same way as Type 2 and such a request normally takes less than 30 days to process. In case it takes longer to process the request, due to the complexity of the request, the data subject is informed of the delay. On 15 June 2021, Spotify implemented changes which mean that all Spotify users who request a copy of personal data beyond what is available in ""Download your data"" tool, or that directly requests a copy of all its personal data from Spotify's customer service, get access to extended streaming history as well as technical log information in one package. Spotify has stated that the design of the process and its development up to today are one aggregate result of joint discussions, careful considerations and analyses as well as meetings with relevant customer service and development teams. Spotify's data protection team has provided advice regarding legal requirements and ""best practices"" in data protection and continues to continuously update these based on a number of identified parameters, including relevant and current legislation, guidance, the ability to quickly respond to a large number of requests, ease of use and categories of personal data that is processed. Spotify has stated that they have over 232 million monthly active users and that during the period from 25 May 2018 to 30 June 2019 they answered 753,575 requests about access. According to Spotify, the division of data into three different types has done so possible to provide a quick and easy way for the data subject to download them personal data that is likely to be most relevant to the data subject and to generate answer in large measure and with the speed required to satisfy the majority of those registered. 12 Spotify further refers to statements in the EDPB's transparency guidelines that it i data protection regulation there is an inherent tension between the requirements to provide the recorded extensive information on the one hand and that the information should be given in one concise, clear and clear, comprehensible and easily accessible form on the other hand, that one must determine how to prioritize information that must be provided to data subjects and which levels of detail and methods are suitable for conveying the information and that the principle of openness is an overarching obligation. Spotify believes that these guidelines has relevance for the design of a concise, open, easy to understand and easily accessible process for data subjects to exercise their rights under Article 15 i data protection regulation. By providing three layers of response to requests for access to registered, Spotify intends to balance the data protection regulation's interests on one correct way in favor of Spotify's registrants. Spotify's goal is to provide correct information in accordance with Article 15 to all data subjects at the right time by provide information in different layers and in different ways. Spotify has stated that the company informed registered users that it was possible to request access to more personal data than those covered by Type 1 and Type 2, as well as 12Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, WP260rev.01, as adopted by European Data Protection Board, point 1 and point 34. Data Protection Authority Diary number: DI-2019-6696 14(30) Date: 2023-06-12 that this information was provided to data subjects before they requested access to theirs personal data. Furthermore, Spotify has stated that it appeared that those registered could request access to more personal data than those covered by Type 1 by request a Type 2 response. In addition, registered users could contact Spotify's customer service with special requests (so-called Type 3 request). The information about this is provided in different ways way, including on the website for ""Personal data rights and privacy settings"" and on the website where information according to Article 15 i the data protection regulation is published. When a user requests access to the personal data covered by Type 1 by going to ""Download your data"" is further according to Spotify clear from the context that users get access to a selection of their personal data and not all their personal data. On the ""Download your data"" page there is also a reference to the web page ""Personal data rights and privacy settings”. For requests according to both Type 1 and Type 2, information is given according to article 15 of the data protection regulation which contains a comprehensive description of available data. The information sources also explain that the user can request access to their personal data via customer service or by contacting Spotify via email. If a user contacts Spotify's customer service to exercise the right of access according to article 15 of the data protection regulation, customer service can explain all three types of personal data that is available and inform users about it further information that is available. The registrants were also informed that they could request access to more personal data than they have already downloaded on the website ""Understand my data"". Furthermore, during the processing of the case, Spotify has updated the information that directs itself to the data subjects in order to make it more transparent for data subjects that it exists more to request than what is available in the ""Download Your Data"" tool. With regard to the clarity of the information, Spotify has essentially stated the following. At designing the access request response format the company focused on provide all information in a way that makes it relevant, transparent and helpful for those registered. The company developed a routine to ensure that the descriptions of the personal data is correct and complete, which included extensive efforts for to translate technical information into a simple language that can be understood by a average customer, however, without removing such details as are necessary for transparency. To facilitate understanding, Spotify does, among other things, the following. - When downloading Type 1 information, the registered person also receives a so-called ""Read Me First"" file. In the ""Read Me First"" file there is a link to the web page ""Understand my data"", where the format and personal data included in Type 1 are described. This one page has been updated during the processing of the case to now also include one general description of the data in the technical log files and the extended the streaming history. The linked pages are automatically displayed on the customer's preferred one language based on the language setting in the customer's browser. - In the Type 2 information, which consists of technical log files, there is some information which is highly technical in nature. To help data subjects understand the formatting of the personal data Spotify provides a detailed description of the personal data in a special file in connection with the data provided (in a “Read Me First” file for Type 2 requests). This description provided by default in English. Spotify also answers customers' questions about the significance of the personal data provided, as part of its process for access request was registered. Spotify also continuously updates both 13From June 15, 2019 comprehensive Type 2 information, in addition to the technical log files, also expanded listening history. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 15(30) Date: 2023-06-12 the format of technical log files attributable to the customer's user ID (Type 2) and corresponding information in the Type 2 “Read Me First” file to increase transparency based on the questions asked. – As regards special requests (Type 3), when the personal data which provided may require explanations, Spotify may, if necessary, leave the information in an e-mail to the data subject together with the copy of the personal data. Spotify has stated the following as background to the description of the Type 2 data by default is left in English. To ensure that the information that the company providing the registrants are correctly translated into their local language they are sent files to be translated by manual translation to professional translators. Against background of technical log data changing more dynamically over time than others personal data that is collected, the company would have to send the extensive ""Read me First” file on translation several times a month. This would be disproportionate and unreasonable to do for all local languages given the extra time, resources and administration it would entail. Furthermore, many of the words have appear in the technical log data typically no translation because they often reflect technical concepts communicated primarily in English and usually not translated into local languages. However, the company helps with translation the information into local language if a user requests it to the extent they the technical terms are translatable. Spotify has further stated that they have responded to approximately 340,000 requests for access to technical log files. Of these requests, only two registrants have turned to the company and requested one translation of the description into their local language. Spotify further believes that translation of the technical log files without request would mean that all data subjects would have to wait longer to obtain their right of access by the technical the log files provided. In terms of which format is used, Spotify has stated that the personal data provided in JSON format which, according to the company, is a structured and widely used format that can be understood by both computers and humans. Data provided to however, following a Type 3 request is provided in the format needed to respond request. Spotify has further informed IMY on 17 October 2022 that the company has since the time allowed for data subjects to request access to account data, extended streaming history and technical log information directly through ""Download your data""- the tool, i.e. without contacting customer service. These routines are not covered by IMY's review when the update has taken place after May 16, 2022. 3.2.2 The Privacy Protection Authority's assessment According to Article 15.1 of the data protection regulation, the data subject has the right to receive confirmation on whether the personal data controller processes personal data concerning him or her and in that case gain access to the personal data. The personal data controller has, according to Article 15.3, an obligation to provide the data subject with a copy of the personal data that is being processed. The right of access is the same regardless by who the data controller is but the way to handle a request for access may vary, among other things depending on the extent of the personal data that processed and the number of registrants. According to Article 12.2 of the Data Protection Ordinance, the personal data controller an obligation to facilitate the data subject to exercise their rights. The Data Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 16(30) Date: 2023-06-12 The purpose of the right of access is for the data subject to become aware of it processing that takes place and be able to check that it is legal. The The data controller must therefore ensure that the copy of personal data that is provided contains all the personal data processed about it registered and is designed in a way that is comprehensible to the registered. Access to the personal data must be given in a way that meets the requirements for transparency in Article 12.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. The requirements placed on the design and content of the copy mean that they personal data controllers who process a large amount of data or data that is particularly difficult to understand, may need to take special measures when the information presented to those registered. Spotify, whose personal data processing is both extensive and complex, has taken develop special procedures for handling requests for access. The question is about these routines enable the company to provide access to the personal data they process in one way that satisfies the data subject's right of access. Division of the copy of personal data into different layers Spotify divides the copy of personal data into different layers, Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3. IMY believes that there is no obstacle to dividing the copy of personal information in this way as long as the right of access is satisfied. In some situations, on the contrary, it can help the registrant to absorb the information if it is presented separately, in any case when it is a matter of an extensive amount of information. The provision of the copy on however, personal data in different layers must neither restrict the right of access nor make it difficult the exercise of it. The person in charge of personal data must therefore take this into account in particular the assessment of whether it is an appropriate measure to divide the copy of personal data. A data subject who addresses a personal data controller to request access to their personal data normally lacks knowledge of which personal data are actually treated. Acquiring this knowledge is instead often the very purpose of request. If the personal data controller in this situation only provides it registrant with a selection of his personal data, the registrant risks that is led to believe that the copy provided is complete. For this reason, IMY considers that the personal data controller, in the channel he has established so that the data subject can request access, must be clear that the copy of the personal data is divided into different layers. It must also be clear to it recorded what information is in the various layers and in what way registrants can access these.4 In the report Spotify has submitted, it appears that the registered, in several different channels, receives information that access to different personal data can be requested in different ways. Through these channels it appears that access to ""your most relevant personal data"" can obtained through the ""download your data"" function as well as access to technical log information, extended streaming history or responses to other specific data protection requests may be obtained upon request via e-mail or customer service. IMY can, of those reported in the report the examples, state that the information provided to the registered also contains 14 Cf. The European Data Protection Board's (EDPB's) guidelines on the right of access - Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights – Right of access, version 2.0 (finally adopted on March 28, 2023), point 146. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 17(30) Date: 2023-06-12 an overall enumeration of which personal data the various types of requests include. IMY assesses that the information provided by Spotify in this regard, during that period which the review of the general routines refers to, is sufficiently clear that it data subjects must understand how the copy is divided, including what information is contained in them the different layers, and how the different layers should be requested. To set up special conditions for the exercise of the right of access without support i the data protection regulation risks causing the data subject to be unduly hindered in their exercise of the right. In other words, it can be perceived as unnecessarily complicated to exercise the right, which in turn may result in the data subject refraining from requesting out all information to which the registered person is entitled. There are reasons to emphasize that the personal data controller, according to article 12.2 of the data protection regulation, has a obligation to facilitate the exercise of the data subject's rights. In order to the provision of the copy of personal data in different layers shall not entail that the right is restricted or that the exercise of the right is made more difficult, IMY therefore considers that it cannot be required that the data subject returns to the personal data controller on several occasions to gain access to all personal data. Nor can it be complicated to request access to the various layers. IMY therefore considers that it registrants must be able to request access to all warehouses from the beginning and that it should be easy to get access to these. Another thing is that the registered, with the knowledge of how the data is divided, yet can choose to only request access 15 to one or more layers. From Spotify's statement, it appears that the registered person can request access to the various the layers in different ways. It is not required that the registrant returns to Spotify to take part of the different layers. However, the data subject may have to take several measures to get access to several layers, e.g. by both downloading Type 1 information through function ""download your data"" and by requesting access to Type 2 and Type 3 information through customer service. If the data subject contacts customer service directly with their request, the data subject can request access to all personal data at the same time. IMY considers that the fact that the data subject must take various measures for requesting the various layers of data may cause some inconvenience. The registered however, has the opportunity to take all of these actions at one and the same time. All measures can also be taken easily via Spotify's website. At an overall assessment, IMY believes that Spotify's routines enable the registered to request access to all their personal data in a sufficiently simple way. The design of the copy and format of the copy It follows from Article 12.1 of the data protection regulation that the information provided according to Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation must be given in a concise, clear and understandable, understandable and easily accessible form using clear and unambiguous language. What requirements should placed on clarity in the individual case must be assessed against the background of the purpose of the right of access, i.e. that the data subject must become aware of the treatment which takes place and be able to check that the processing is legal. 1 Cf. The European Data Protection Board's (EDPB's) guidelines on the right of access - Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights – Right of access, version 2.0 (finally adopted on March 28, 2023), point 146. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 18(30) Date: 2023-06-12 The majority of the data that Spotify processes, especially when it comes to data in the technical log files are by their very nature very technical as they contain e.g. codes and numbers. Such information can be difficult for the average data subject to understand. To to provide such information without further explanation would, according to IMY, not live up to the requirements for clarity, in terms of the purpose of the right. Because the data to provided in accordance with Article 15.1 of the Data Protection Regulation and covered by a copy according to article 15.3 of the data protection regulation shall be the personal data which is processed, however, it is not permitted for the personal data controller to change difficult-to-understand personal data to facilitate understanding. Such data can instead need to be explained. Spotify provides, together with the copy of personal data, additional descriptions for to make the data in the various layers comprehensible to the data subject. Spotify responds also on the data subject's questions about the meaning of the personal data provided and updates its general procedures and descriptions based on the questions that are asked. IMY believes that data in the technical log files that Spotify provides can be complicated to understand, despite the descriptions provided by Spotify. IMY believes however, that by providing these descriptions, Spotify enables it registered, albeit with some effort, to assimilate the information. That it despite descriptions, some effort may be required by the data subject to understand some particularly complicated tasks are a natural consequence of the nature of these tasks. By default, Spotify provides only the detailed description of the data in the technical log files in English. Neither Article 12.1 nor Article 15 i the data protection regulation contains an explicit requirement in which language personal data, or the description thereof, must be provided to the data subject. However, IMY believes that it follows from the purpose of the right of access and the requirements for clarity i article 12.1 that the registered should be able to receive the information in a language they know, i at least when the personal data controller directs its activities to countries where this constitutes an official language. This means that the personal data controller must take sufficient measures to ensure that the data subject understands the information. Spotify provides the majority of information provided to registered according to Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation, including a general description of what the technical log files may include, based on the language settings in the individual's web settings, i.e. the local language. Further Spotify leaves clear information, in the local language, about the possibility to request translation of the description of the technical log files in the ""Read Me First"" file which provided with each request for access. This information is also provided at the local the language on the ""Understand my data"" webpage. Spotify has thus taken extensive measures to provide information in a language that the data subject must know comprehend. However, Spotify has reported significant difficulties in translating the description of the data in the technical log files to all local languages in them countries to which they direct their operations. The difficulties have their basis in the constant the changes to the data in the technical log files and the fact that many technical concepts can hardly be translated from English. 1Cf the Article 29 Group's Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, WP260rev.01, adopted by European Data Protection Board, point 13 and the European Data Protection Board's (EDPB) guidelines on the right to access – Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights – Right of access, version 2.0 (finally adopted on 28 March 2023) point 142. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 19(30) Date: 2023-06-12 However, IMY notes that Spotify has stated that, at the request of a data subject, they have possibility to translate the description of the data in the technical log files into one local language to the extent that the technical terms are translatable. Since a translation is therefore possible in practice, IMY believes that such a translation should can be provided even before a request for translation has been made from one registered. Spotify's stated difficulty in translating the description, including that translation may need to be done on several occasions each month and the additional ones resources this requires, cannot justify leaving the description as default either in English. Considering the purpose of the right of access, it is crucial that it data subjects understand which of their personal data has been processed in the technical the log files, which requires an understandable description of its content. IMY therefore considers that Spotify should have provided the description in local language already in connection with that the technical log files were provided to the data subject, at least to that extent it was necessary to understand the data in the technical log files. Against this background, IMY believes that Spotify has not taken sufficient measures to ensure that the data subject understands the description of the data in the technical the log files when this information is only provided in English by default. The information that Spotify provides in this part therefore did not meet the requirements that all communications provided to the data subject pursuant to Article 15 i the data protection regulation must be clear and understandable in the manner specified in Article 12.1 i data protection regulation. The fact that a data subject has the opportunity to return to Spotify to request a translation does not cure this deficiency. It follows from Article 15.3 of the data protection regulation that a data subject who makes a request if access in electronic form must receive the information in an electronic format that is generally used, unless the data subject requests otherwise. Spotify is leaving the data in JSON format. In the guidelines on the right to data portability, JSON format is given 17 as an example of a widely used open format. IMY states that the requirements set for formats are different for the right to data portability and the right of access when data portability according to article 20.1 of the data protection regulation also requires that the data be provided in a structured and machine-readable format format. In terms of the purpose of the right of access, IMY requires that the format in which the data is provided in accordance with Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation must be possible to read for a natural person. However, there is nothing to prevent the format from also being machine readable. Such a format can, in many cases, make it easier for the registered to himself make various summaries or searches to facilitate understanding. IMY believes that JSON format, which can be read by both computers and natural persons, i the current situation is such an electronic generally used format as referred to in Article 15.3 i data protection regulation. Summary assessment regarding the right of access to personal data and copy on personal data during processing – article 15.1 and 15.3 of the data protection regulation In summary, IMY finds that Spotify's way of dividing the copy of personal data in different layers does not hinder the exercise of the data subjects' rights and thus is in accordance with article 12.2 of the data protection regulation and that the design and format on the copy of personal data largely meets the requirements for transparency in Article 12.1 i data protection regulation. 1Article 29 Group Guidelines on the right to data portability, WP242 rev.01, adopted by the European the Swedish Data Protection Agency, p. 19. The Swedish Data Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 20(30) Date: 2023-06-12 However, IMY finds that the description of the data in the technical log files which Spotify left during the period from and including 11 June 2019 to and including 16 May 2022 has not met the requirements of Article 12.1 of the Data Protection Regulation when this information by default has only been provided in English. Spotify has thus i in this respect processed personal data in violation of Article 12.1 i data protection regulation during the relevant time period. 4 Examination of individual complaints - Justification of decisions 4.1 Complaint 1 (from the Netherlands with national reference number z2018-28415) 4.1.1 Background The appellant has argued in summary that Spotify due to his the access request made on 27 May 2018 has not provided access to all of his personal data within the time prescribed in Article 12.3 of the data protection regulation and that, once he has gained access to all personal data, these have not provided in an understandable form in the manner prescribed in Article 12.1 i data protection regulation. 4.1.2 What has emerged in the matter Spotify provides three types of responses to ensure an appropriate and complete response response to its users' requests in accordance with Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation. Spotify has stated that information about all three types of responses (Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3) as well as information on how to request access to them was available at the time of the appellant's request. In connection with a user choosing to load down its data (Type 1), was evident from the description and instructions in direct connection with the download tool that this was just a convenient way to get a copy of “the most"" personal data from his account and which categories of personal data that were available through the tool. From the context it was therefore clear enough that other personal data was also available. The appellant also had the opportunity to contact customer service via several channels and request additional personal data. The complainant had also had the opportunity to turn to customer service and directly request access to all their personal data. Spotify believes that the process at the time was transparent enough to users would be able to understand as well as request additional available data in addition to those which was included in the ""Download your data"" tool. Many other users also requested both Type 2 and Type 3 tasks at that time. The appellant also succeeded in requesting and access both Type 1 and Type 2 information. Spotify has subsequently done the majority improvements in their processes to ensure that users cannot miss all three types of information available and how to easily request access to it the information. Spotify has stated that with regard to the provision of the complainant's personal data, so provided all requested personal data within the time frame specified in article 12.3 of the data protection regulation. ""Download your data"" (Type 1) was requested by complainant on 27 May 2018. The data was made available and downloaded by complainant on May 28, 2018. A response time of one day is consistent with Spotify's goal of quickly providing the most relevant information to users through their automatic tools. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 21(30) Date: 2023-06-12 Technical log files (Type 2) were requested by the complainant via email on 11 June 2018. In Spotify's response on July 6, 2018, Spotify informed the complainant that the provision of the personal data would take a little longer than expected due to the high number requests and the complexity of compiling such technical information. The information was made available for download on July 17, 2018. Even after having informed the appellant of the reason why the response would be delayed, only 36 elapsed calendar days (26 working days) between the complainant's request and the receipt of a response. Regarding the complainant's complaint regarding the format of the personal data, Spotify has stated that Type 2 data contains a large number of files with technical log data. What data is processed may differ significantly for different users based on what kind of Spotify service plan they have (eg Free, Premium, Family), features and the specific user's activity, as well as variations in the usual internal the processing and error logging of the Spotify software itself. Its a challenge to find a way to explain this kind of technical information in a way like that the average Spotify user can understand. At the time of the complainant's request, Spotify provided the information in a JSON format. However, Spotify did not provide any additional documentation to further clarify what types of data were included and how these should be interpreted (in addition to the information that appears in the JSON data fields themselves). Since 2019 however, Spotify provides a supplementary ""Read Me First"" file upon delivery of all Type 2 data, which further describes the information contained in each file and data field. Given the complexity and volume of the technical log files required the creation of the ""Read Me First"" file a lot of work, and Spotify had not yet completed this process at the time of the appellant's original request for access. It was a mistake to provide the appellant with some of the technical log files in encrypted format. Spotify stores data in its systems in encrypted format to reinforce the integrity and security in connection with the company's own internal processing of personal data. It was not Spotify's intention to withhold from the complainant personal data from him. Although most of the encrypted data was decrypted before being included in the appellant's technical log files, some of the fields were not decrypted. That kind of problem was fixed upon discovery of this, and now requested personal data is always provided unencrypted. Spotify wants to draw IMY's attention to the fact that the complainant requested their personal data again in July 2020. This request came after his complaint to IMY and the improvements as described above. The complainant received his personal data significantly faster than within 30 days. The complainant requested ""Download your data"" (Type 1) on 28 July 2020. Spotify provided the personal data three calendar days later, on July 31, 2020. The complainant also requested its technical log files (Type 2) on August 3, 2020 and downloaded the personal data when it was available 15 days later, on August 18 2020. Both of these requests were answered within a total of 18 days by Spotify and the complainant was able to receive all his personal data within a total of 21 calendar days. This one timeframe is representative of Spotify's handling of these types of requests from user. All technical information received by the complainant on August 18, 2020 was unencrypted. The complainant should also have received a ""Read Me First"" file as field by field explained the information provided. With the fulfillment of the appellant's latest request, Spotify hopes that all the complainant's questions regarding articles 12.1 and 12.3 of the data protection regulation that he raised in his complaint have been answered. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 22(30) Date: 2023-06-12 4.1.3 The Privacy Protection Authority's assessment As IMY states in the assessment of the company's general routines, section 3.2.2 i this decision, it is possible to divide the copy of personal data into different layers provided that the data subject has received sufficient information, among other things, about how the copy personal data is divided and how access to the various layers can be requested. The fact that the complainant claims that his personal data was not provided in time shows that the appellant must have considered that his initial request which was sent on 27 May 2018 referred to all personal data that Spotify processed about him. Of data such as the complainant left further states that he contacted Spotify because he himself noticed that the copy of personal data he received on 28 May 2018 was not full. The fact that he contacted Spotify was thus a consequence of those conclusions the appellant himself drew from the copy of personal data he received and not from on the grounds that the complainant understood Spotify's division of the copy into personal data and how access to additional data could be requested. These circumstances speak according to IMY for the information provided by Spotify at the time of the complainant the request regarding the division of the copy on personal data has not been sufficient clear. IMY also believes in an assessment of the information provided by Spotify description and instructions in connection with the appellant making his Type 1 request on May 27, 2018 that that information alone was not clear enough to the appellant should have understood that it was only a subset of the personal data which was covered by the request. At the time of the appellant's request, it was also missing information that is currently available on Spotify's website, including on the website for ""Personal data rights and privacy settings"", where it is clear which personal data given in the various responses, and how access to these can be requested. IMY further considers that what Spotify stated that the complainant could turn to customer service and requesting additional information is irrelevant as such action presupposes that the complainant would have understood that there were additional personal data that could be released. In view of the above, IMY considers that Spotify, at the time of the complainant request for access, did not provide sufficiently clear information for the appellant to understand that the copy of personal data was divided. That there is sufficient information for that a registered person must understand that his request only refers to a selection of them personal data that is processed is a prerequisite for the personal data controller must be able to limit the disclosure of this personal data. In case it is unclear about the request only concerns a selection of the personal data, so it should personal data controller assume that the registered person wants access to all of their personal data. Spotify should therefore, as the information in this regard was deficient at the time of the complainant's request, have disclosed all personal data that they dealt with the appellant in connection with his request for access made on May 27, 2018. The time within which Spotify had to leave the copy on all personal data must therefore be calculated from this time. Spotify would, according to the article 12.3 of the data protection regulation, have provided a full copy of the complainant personal data or notified the complainant of an extension of the time period at the latest on 27 June 2018. Spotify first notified the complainant of an extension on 6 July 2018 of the time period. The copy of the additional personal data was provided on 17 July 2018. IMY states that Spotify did not announce the extension within the time that prescribed in article 12.3 of the data protection regulation. Spotify has therefore left the copy on the complainant's personal data too late. The Swedish Data Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 23(30) Date: 2023-06-12 From the complainant's information, as confirmed by Spotify, it appears that they further personal data he gained access to on 17 July 2018 has been difficult to understand as well as, in some case, encrypted. As IMY states under section 3.2.2, it is required that the personal data controller explains particularly difficult to understand personal data so that the purpose of the right of access shall considered fulfilled. IMY notes that Spotify has not lived up to its obligations in the appellant's case as they have not provided an explanation for the particularly difficult to understand information they provided in the copy as well as when they have provided certain information encrypted. IMY states with regard to the above that Spotify in its management of the complainant's request for access made on 27 May 2018 has processed personal data in violation of article 12.3 of the data protection regulation, by making the copy on personal data has been provided too late, as well as in violation of articles 12.1, 15.1 and 15.3 of the data protection regulation, by not having provided all the complainants personal data in an understandable form. 4.2 Complaint 2 (from Austria with national reference no D130.198) 4.2.1 Background The complainant has alleged that Spotify due to his request for access which was made on October 10, 2018 has not provided all the personal data that Spotify treats the complainant that Spotify has not provided any of it information on the processing of the complainant's personal data as required by Article 15.1 a–h and 15.2 of the data protection regulation and that Spotify has not provided the personal data in an understandable form in the manner prescribed in Article 12.1 i data protection regulation. The appellant has stated, among other things, that the information has provided in a format that is only machine-readable and not comprehensible to physical users people. 4.2.2 What has emerged in the matter Spotify has stated that the complainant requested access to ""Download your data"" (Type 1) on 10 October 2018. The data was made available and downloaded by the complainant on 18 October 2018. The complainant then never contacted Spotify again to bring them forward views raised in his complaint to the IMY. Nor did he request access to additional information beyond that made available through ""Download Your Data""- the tool. Spotify provides three types of responses to ensure an appropriate and complete response response to its users' requests in accordance with Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation. Spotify has stated that information about all three types of responses (Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3), as well as information on how to request access to them was available at the time of the appellant's request. In connection with a user choosing to load down its data (Type 1), was evident from the description and instructions in direct connection with tool that this was just a convenient way to get a copy of ""most"" personal data from his account and which categories of personal data were available through the tool. From the context it was therefore clear enough that other personal data was also available. The appellant also had the opportunity to contact customer service via several channels and request additional personal data. Spotify believes that the process at the time was transparent enough to users would be able to understand and request additional available data in addition to those Date: 2023-06-12 which was included in the ""Download your data"" tool. Many other users also requested both Type 2 and Type 3 tasks at that time. Spotify has subsequently done the majority improvements in their processes to ensure that users cannot miss all three types of information available and how to easily request access to it the information. At the time of the appellant's request, the specific web page had information according to article 15.1 a-h and 15.2 of the data protection regulation not yet created and such information was also not automatically included in the access request response. Spotify confirms that the complainant did not receive this information along with his Type 1- response in October 2018. Spotify notes that although the complainant did not receive the specific the information under Article 15 in connection with its request, the information was available for the complainant in Spotify's privacy policy. Spotify has further stated that the company had processes in place to provide additional information and take action in the event that their response would not be considered sufficient to fully respond to a data subject's access request. About the appellant had contacted privacy@spotify.com or Spotify's customer service team regarding their questions, they would have been happy to provide additional personal data and other information according to Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation which he requested. It is true that the complainant's ""Download your data"" data was provided in JSON format. JSON is a recommended standard format that can be understood by both people and computers. The information in ""Download your data"" (Type 1) is largely self-explanatory based on the file and field names. Nowadays, Spotify provides however, also a detailed description of the data on the information webpage, ""Understand my data"". 4.2.3 The Privacy Protection Authority's assessment As IMY states in the assessment of the company's general routines, section 3.2.2 i this decision, it is possible to divide the copy of personal data into different layers provided that the data subject has received sufficient information, among other things, about how the copy personal data is divided and how access to the various layers can be requested. The complainant has, as IMY understands it, wanted access to all the information that Spotify treats about him. However, the appellant has only requested access to Type 1- the data and has also not returned to Spotify for further information. According to IMY, the complainant's actions indicate that the information provided by Spotify at the time of the appellant's request regarding the division of the copy on personal data and how access to the various layers could be requested was not sufficient clear so that the complainant would understand how he would get access to all the information. IMY also believes in an assessment of the information provided by Spotify description and instructions in connection with the appellant making his Type 1 request on October 10, 2018 that that information alone was not clear enough to the appellant should have understood that it was only a subset of the personal data which was covered by the request. At the time of the appellant's request, it was also missing information that is currently available on Spotify's website, including on the website for ""Personal data rights and privacy settings"", where it is clear which personal data given in the various responses, and how access to these can be requested. IMY further considers that what Spotify stated that the complainant could turn to customer service and requesting additional information has no meaning as such action requires that the Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 25(30 Date: 2023-06-12 the complainant would have understood that there were additional personal data that could be released. In view of the above, IMY considers that Spotify, at the time of the complainant request for access, did not provide sufficiently clear information for the appellant to understand that the copy of personal data was divided. That there is sufficient information for that a registered person must understand that his request only refers to a selection of them personal data that is processed is a prerequisite for the personal data controller must be able to limit the disclosure of this personal data. In case it is unclear about the request only concerns a selection of the personal data, so it should personal data controller assume that the registered person wants access to all of their personal data. Spotify should therefore, as the information in this regard was deficient at the time of the complainant's request, have disclosed all personal data that they processed about the appellant. IMY states that Spotify has not disclosed all of them personal data they processed about the complainant. Spotify has therefore not complied the requirements in articles 15.1 and 15.3 of the data protection regulation to give the data subject access to their personal data as the company has not provided the registered with one full copy of the personal data that was being processed. The complainant has further stated that the personal data he has been given access to was difficult to understand. Spotify's response shows that at the time of the complainant's request a description of the information provided to the appellant (Type 1) was missing. IMY however, deems that the information provided pursuant to a Type 1 request is sufficient clear for the average user to be able to understand the data and that these therefore do not require any further explanation. IMY therefore believes that they personal data provided has been sufficiently clear to meet the requirements according to article 12.1 of the data protection regulation, i.e. that the information provided according to Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation must be given in a concise, clear and understandable, understandable and easily accessible form using clear and unambiguous language. Some lack therefore has was not available regarding how clear the personal data provided to the appellant was where. However, IMY looks positively on the improvements that Spotify has implemented after this time, which can further increase the understanding of the personal data provided in Type 1 response. The complainant has further stated that his personal data was provided in a format which was only machine readable and not comprehensible to natural persons. Spotify has stated that the data was provided in JSON format. IMY believes, which also appears above below 3.2.2, that JSON format, which can be read by both computers and natural persons, i the current situation is such an electronic generally used format as referred to in Article 15.3 i data protection regulation. IMY therefore considers that there was no deficiency in respect of the format in which the information was provided to the complainant. The appellant has finally claimed that he did not receive information according to Article 15.1 a-h and 15.2 of the data protection regulation. Spotify has confirmed that the complainant did not receive this information together with the response to the request submitted in October 2018. Spotify has thus not fulfilled its obligation to, in connection with the appellant's request for access, provide information according to article 15.1 a-h and 15.2. The fact that information at the time of the complainant's request was available in the company's privacy policy healer not this deficiency. IMY concludes in summary that Spotify in its handling of the complainant's request if access made on 10 October 2018 has processed personal data in violation with article 15.1 and 15.3 of the data protection regulation, by not having given access to the Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 26(30) Date: 2023-06-12 all personal data that Spotify processed about the complainant and in conflict with article 15.1 a-h and 15.2 of the data protection regulation, by not having provided any of the information set out in these regulations. 4.3 Complaint 3 (from Denmark with national reference number 2018-31-1198) The complainant has claimed that Spotify has not responded to the complainant's request access according to Article 15 of the data protection regulation made on November 12, 2018. The investigation into the matter has not shown that Spotify failed in its handling of the complainant request for access, which means that the current complaint must be rejected. The receiving supervisory authority, i.e. the Danish data protection authority, shall therefore adopt the decision regarding this complaint in accordance with Article 60.8 of the Data Protection Regulation. The justification for the decision in this part is thus reported in a separate decision from it Danish Data Protection Authority. 5 Choice of intervention 5.1 Applicable Regulations In the event of violations of the data protection regulation, IMY has a number of corrective measures powers, including reprimands, injunctions and penalty charges. It follows from article 58.2 a–j of the data protection regulation. IMY shall impose penalty fees in addition to or in lieu of other corrective measures as referred to in Article 58(2) of the Data Protection Regulation, depending on the circumstances i each individual case. If a personal data controller or a personal data assistant, with respect to a and the same or connected data processing, intentionally or by negligence violates several of the provisions of this regulation, it may the total amount of the administrative penalty fee does not exceed the amount determined for the most serious violation. It appears from Article 83.3 i data protection regulation. Each supervisory authority must ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty charges in each individual case are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The stated in Article 83.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. In article 83.2 of the data protection regulation, the factors that must be considered in order to decide whether an administrative penalty fee should be imposed, but also what should affect the size of the penalty fee. The EDPB has adopted guidelines on the calculation of administrative penalty fees according to the data protection regulation which aims to create a harmonized method and principles 18 for calculation of penalty fees. 18EDPB's guidelines 8/2020 Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR, final adopted on 24 May 2023. Data Protection Authority Diary number: DI-2019-6696 27(30) Date: 2023-06-12 5.2 Same or connected data processing As noted above, IMY, in the review carried out by the authority, has Spotify's general processes and routines for providing access according to Article 15 i data protection regulation, found deficiencies in the information provided in accordance with Article 15.1 a–h and 15.2 of the data protection regulation as well as in the description of the data in them the technical log files provided by Spotify. Spotify has also failed in its handling of request for access in relation to two of the complaints IMY has reviewed, complaint 1 and complaint 2. The violations regarding the general routines relate to the information according to article 15.1 a-h and 15.2 of the data protection regulation, to the period from on November 16, 2021 through May 16, 2022 as well as, regarding the description of the data in the technical log files, to the period from June 11, 2019 to and with May 16, 2022. Request for access covered by the individuals the complaints were made on 27 May 2018 and 10 October 2018 respectively. IMY assesses among other things against this background that the violations refer to the general ones the procedures and violations relating to the two complaints do not constitute the same or connected treatments in the manner referred to in Article 83.3 i data protection regulation. However, IMY considers that Spotify's provision of information covered by article 15.1 and 15.2 of the data protection regulation and the provision of the description of the data in the technical log files are interconnected. The the assessment is made, among other things, against the background of the identified deficiencies in these parts relate to the requirements for transparency in the information that Spotify has provided to them registered according to Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation under a partial coinciding time period. Furthermore, the complaints are deemed to be connected with each other. IMY must therefore decide on the choice of intervention partly for the identified deficiencies i Spotify's information according to article 15.1 and 15.2 of the data protection regulation and i the description of the data in the technical log files partly for the findings the deficiencies regarding the two complaints. 5.3 Deficiencies in information according to article 15.1 and 15.2 i the data protection regulation and in the description of the data i the technical log files IMY has assessed that Spotify has violated articles 12.1, 15.1 a-d, 15.1 g and 15.2 i data protection regulation. Against the background, among other things, that the violations have been able to affect a large number of registrants, that the violations have been going on for a long time and as the deficiencies in the information made it difficult for registered users to take care of their others rights according to the data protection act, it is not a question of minor violations. Spotify must therefore be charged a penalty fee for the violations in this part. IMY states that Spotify has violated articles covered by Article 83.5 i data protection regulation which means that a penalty fee of up to twenty million EUR or four percent of the global annual turnover in the previous financial year, depending on which value is higher, may be imposed. When determining the maximum amount of a penalty charge to be imposed on a company should the definition of the term company be used that the EU Court of Justice uses at the Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 28(30) Date: 2023-06-12 application of Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU (see recital 150 i data protection regulation). It appears from the court's practice that this includes every entity that carries out economic activities, regardless of the legal form of the entity and the way of doing so financing as well as even if the unit in the legal sense consists of several physical or legal entities. IMY assesses that the company's turnover is to be used as a basis for calculating the administrative penalty fees that Spotify may impose are Spotify's parent company Spotify Technology S.A. From Spotify Technology S.A.'s annual report for the year 2022 it appears that the annual turnover in 2022 was approximately SEK 132,000,000,000. The highest sanction amount that can be determined in the case is four percent of this amount, approx SEK 5,280,000,000. When assessing the seriousness of the violations, IMY takes in addition to what is stated above, i.e. that the violations have been able to affect a large number of registrants, that the violations has been going on for a long time and that the deficiencies in the information made it difficult for data subjects to take advantage of your other rights according to the data protection regulation, also taking into account the following. The violations have entailed a risk that the purpose of the right of access is then thwarted the deficiencies in the information provided made it difficult for data subjects to understand which of their personal data that has been processed and how. The registrant thus does not have nor had the opportunity to check whether the processing was legal. Spotify's processing of personal data further includes a large amount of personal data about each registered and affects many registered users in several different countries. However, as far as has come to light, the data processed are not such special ones categories of personal data specified in Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation. Processing of personal data that takes place within the framework of a customer relationship at the provision of a music streaming service does not normally get large either consequences for the data subjects. IMY has further, despite the scope of Spotify's personal data processing, only received a few complaints regarding the company's handling access requests. It is also important that Spotify has a challenge in providing comprehensive information about complex personal data processing in a way that is comprehensible to the data subjects which entails difficult trade-offs to assess how the information should best be used is presented. Spotify has provided certain information in accordance with all points in Article 15.1 and 15.2 of the data protection regulation. Furthermore, Spotify has provided information about its processing of personal data on several pages on the company's website. Some information about how the personal data was processed can also be read from that copy personal data according to article 15.3 of the data protection regulation that Spotify has provided to the data subjects who requested access and which IMY has generally assessed meet the requirements for clarity in Article 12.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. The investigation into the matter further shows that Spotify, on its own initiative and before the relevant date supervisory case was initiated, has taken several measures and put in extensive work to produce, develop and improve processes regarding requests for access that shall be transparent for those registered. These processes and routines have since been developed and continuously improved. According to IMY, this suggests that Spotify intends to fulfill the right of access in a way that is transparent to the data subjects. It also has forward until last year, when the EDPB adopted guidelines on the right of access, was lacking in detail guidance on how the information should be provided and at what level of detail, among other things 19 European Data Protection Board (EDPB) guidelines on the right of access - Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights – Right of access, (adopted on January 18, 2022 for public consultation and finally adopted on March 28, 2023). Data Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6696 29(30) Date: 2023-06-12 regarding the degree of individualization of the information to be provided according to article 15.1 and 15.2 of the data protection regulation and which language should be used in communication according to Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation. Overall, IMY assesses, against the background of the reported circumstances, that they the violations in question are of low seriousness. The starting point for the calculation of the penalty fee should therefore be set relatively low in relation to the current situation the maximum amount. To ensure a proportional penalty fee in the individual case there are also reasons to further adjust the starting point for it already at this stage continue the calculation downwards, taking into account the high turnover involved basis for the calculation of the penalty fee. In addition to assessing the seriousness of the violation, IMY must assess whether it exists any aggravating or mitigating circumstances that become relevant the amount of the penalty fee. The circumstances which have already been considered at the assessment of the seriousness of the infringement cannot be reconsidered at this stage of the assessment. IMY assesses that there are no further aggravating circumstances that affect the amount of the penalty fee. As a mitigating circumstance, IMY attaches particular importance the possibility for those registered to contact Spotify's customer service through several different channels to receive further individualized information. Furthermore, Spotify has in June 2022 informed that the company has made updates to the information in accordance with Article 15 among other for the data subject to understand the specific personal data processing which is applicable to their unique use of the Spotify service. As for the shortcomings regarding Spotify's choice of language for the description of the data in the technical the log files, it is also important that data subjects have had the opportunity to turn to Spotify to have the description translated or explained in its local language and to Spotify provided clear information about this possibility in the ""Read Me First"" file which submitted in connection with the data being provided to the data subject. Against the background of the seriousness of the violations, aggravating and mitigating circumstances and the high turnover in relation to those established the violations, the IMY determines the administrative penalty fee for Spotify at 58 000 000 kroner. In doing so, IMY has assessed that this amount, which corresponds to approximately 1 percent of the highest possible sanction amount that can be determined in the case, is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in the present case. 5.4 Violations regarding complaints 1 and 2 IMY has established that Spotify breached its obligations in relation to the complainants in complaints 1 and 2. However, IMY can state that the complainants in both cases have received access to some of their personal data in a timely manner. Spotify has further, when the appellant in complaint 1 contacted them, were helpful in providing further information and answered questions. Regarding complaint 2, Spotify has not been made aware that the complainant considered that his request for access was not fully met. The appellant has did not turn to Spotify and stated that he was dissatisfied with the company's handling of his request for access why Spotify has had difficulty remedying the shortfall. IMY states that the violations currently in question did not include sensitive ones personal data. Spotify has further taken measures, albeit insufficient, in order to accommodate the appellants' requests. Although the complainants' right of access does not Date: 2023-06-12 met fully, the deficiencies that have been present are therefore of a less serious nature character than if the requests had been left unanswered. In an overall assessment, IMY finds that, regarding the violations in complaint 1 and 2, are minor violations and that there is therefore reason to waive from imposing a penalty fee on Spotify for the established violations herein part. Spotify must instead be given a reprimand in accordance with Article 58.2 b i data protection regulation. Spotify has stated that the company is happy to cooperate with the complainants directly in order to ensure that it has provided all the data and the information that the complainants searching as well as that it has answered their questions. From information that emerged in the case, the complainant in complaint 1 has turned to Spotify again in July 2020 and subsequently granted access in accordance with Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation. The complainant received all his personal data, including an explanatory document about the personal data that was processed, within 21 days. The personal data that then were left unencrypted. When the appellant has had his request for access granted if there is no reason to order Spotify to grant access again in accordance with Article 15. Regarding complaint 2, no information has emerged that the complainant has received access to more personal data or more information after the response to the access request in October 2018. Spotify must therefore, with the support of Article 58.2 c of the data protection regulation, ordered to comply with the appellant's request for access pursuant to Article 15 i the data protection regulation by giving the complainant access to all personal data that Spotify processes about him by providing him with a copy of the personal data according to article 15.3 of the data protection regulation as well as information according to article 15.1 a-h and 15.2 of the data protection regulation. Spotify has thereby to take into account the exceptions to the right of access in Article 15.4 of the Data Protection Regulation and ch. 5 the data protection act that can be updated. IMY assesses that access should submitted within one month of this decision becoming legally binding. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This decision has been taken by the general manager Lena Lindgren Schelin after a presentation by lawyers Karin Ekström and Evelin Palmér.

This has been done by the regional board within the region sent sensitive personal data and social security numbers via e-mail. The transmission of e- the mail was encrypted but not the information in the emails. The treatment has also occurred in violation of Region Uppsala's own guidelines. This means that the regional board have not taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of safety appropriate to the risk of treatment. The IMY decides on the basis of Articles 58 (2) and 83 of the Data Protection Ordinance and Chapter 6. § 2 of the Data Protection Act that the regional board, for violation of Article 32 (1) i the Data Protection Regulation, shall pay an administrative penalty fee of 300,000 (three hundred thousand) kronor. Report on the supervisory matter The starting point for supervision IMY decided to initiate an investigation against the regional board after a report of personal data incident from the regional board on 7 May 2019. IMY's review covers two categories of personal data processing. The first category refers to emails with patient information sent automated to relevant care administrations within the Uppsala Region for, among other things administration and quality assurance. The second category refers to emails with patient information sent manually to researchers and doctors within the Uppsala Region for, among other things, research and quality monitoring. IMY has examined whether the personal data processing in the e-mail meets the requirements security provided for in Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Protection Ordinance came into force on 25 May 2018. IMY's supervision covers therefore the period from 25 May 2018 to 7 May 2019 (when notification was received). IMY has has not reviewed the measures that the regional board has stated that it has taken after the 7th May 2019. Information from the regional board The Regional Board has stated, among other things, the following. Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with concerning the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and on the repeal of Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Regulation). 2The Act (2018: 218) with supplementary provisions to the EU Data Protection Regulation. Page 2 of 10, Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2019-9457 3 (10) Date: 2022-01-26 The first category of personal data processing - e-mail sent automated The statistical database Cosmic Intelligence retrieved personal data from the main journal system Cosmic. The personal information was then retrieved by Business Objects that put the information in an excel file. The transfers took place automatically each month. Business Objects then sent the Excel files to the relevant healthcare administrations within the Uppsala Region, such as the University Hospital and the Hospital in Enköping. E- the mail messages were sent automatically every month to Region Uppsala's e-mail postal domains. The emails were sent only to authorized persons within it administration that was concerned within the Uppsala Region. The current excel files could contain all the information from the patient record, in addition to the running text from the patient record's free text field. Depending on the type of report, other information could also be included, such as waiting times and patient category. The Excel files also contained information about social security number, name, care unit and contact date. About 25 emails were sent each month to about a hundred recipients within The academic hospital's area of activity. Hundreds of transmitters and receivers within The Uppsala region had access to the personal data. The overall purpose of the processing of personal data has been administration, for example, to correct errors in the operations and to rectify them. In addition, the purpose has been to develop and ensure the quality of the business. The processing of personal data has been ongoing since 2015 until the Regional Board notification of the incident to IMY on May 7, 2019. The treatment was stopped completely in in connection with the discovery of the incident. The second category of personal data processing - e-mail sent manually The statistical database Cosmic Intelligence retrieved personal data from the main journal system Cosmic. The Diver output system then retrieved personal data from Cosmic Intelligence and the patient administration systems IMX and PAS. Socket of personal data was then done manually from Diver to Excel files. The manual the withdrawals were made by, among others, the system developer and the administrator at the regional office. These excel files were then sent to doctors when they had requested information for quality monitoring purposes and to researchers when requested research data. The emails were sent only to recipients who were employees within Region Uppsala, ie only to Region Uppsala's e- postal domains. This means that the emails were not sent to email addresses affiliated with Uppsala University. The Excel files could, among other things, contain information about social security numbers, diagnostic codes, contact date, area of activity, age, county, action code and department. The Excel files did not contain name information. The Excel files only concerned patients who were being treated at the Academic Hospital. Approximately 200−250 emails were sent per year. Hundreds of transmitters and recipients within the Uppsala Region had access to the personal data. The personal data was processed for administrative purposes and to develop and secure the quality of the business and for research purposes. Page 3 of 10, Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2019-9457 4 (10) Date: 2022-01-26 The processing of personal data lasted from September 2014 until the regional board's notification about the incident to IMY on May 7, 2019. The treatment was stopped completely in connection with that the incident was discovered and work began to develop a solution for email encryption. Information concerning both personal data processing Personal data responsibility The Regional Board is responsible for personal data for the personal data processing that concerns compilation of data in Business Objects and for the processing that takes place at automatic transmission by e-mail. The processing takes place at the administration regional office, which is placed under the board's regional board. This assessment is made against given that the regional board is an independent administrative authority which determines the purpose and means of the processing of personal data. The Regional Board is also responsible for personal data for the processing that takes place in Diver and for the processing that takes place via the manual transmission via e-mail. The Regional Board has attached the documents Regulations for boards and committees in Uppsala Region and the Regional Board's delegation procedure. Control document According to Region Uppsala's governing document on handling mail and e-mail gets sensitive personal data is not communicated via e-mail. Categories of registered Categories of registered are employees, patients, children and persons with protection identity. In the case of employees, information about them only appears in sending and receiving e-mail addresses. The personal data processing affects a total of between 100,000 and 500,000 individuals for the period 2015−2019. Categories of users The categories of users who have access to the personal data are administrative personnel with access to source systems and storage areas. Encryption The transport (transmission) of e-mail within the region was encrypted though the information in the excel files was not protected by encryption. The transport of the e-mail was sent encrypted with the cryptographic the communication protocol TLS1.2 to recipients within the Uppsala Region. In the first processing of personal data, the Regional Board used a local e- mail server when transporting e-mail between Business Objects and recipients within the region. In the second reading, the Regional Board used Microsoft's Outlook for e- the mail. Page 4 of 10, Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2019-9457 5 (10) Date: 2022-01-26 There were no technical protection measures to prevent reading and modification of the information in the excel files. There were also no protective measures in place to prevent that unauthorized persons took part in the information. Justification of the decision Applicable rules The responsibility of the personal data controller He who alone or together with others decides the purposes and means for the processing of personal data is the person responsible for personal data. It is stated in Article 4 (7) in the Data Protection Regulation. The person responsible for personal data is responsible for and must be able to show that the basics the principles of Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation are complied with (Article 5 (2) of the Regulation). The person responsible for personal data is responsible for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the treatment is carried out in in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. The measures shall be implemented taking into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment and the risks, of varying degrees of probability and seriousness, for the freedoms and rights of natural persons. The measures must be reviewed and updated as necessary. It is stated in Article 24 (1) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. The requirement for security in the processing of personal data, etc. Health information constitutes so-called sensitive personal data. It is forbidden to process such personal data in accordance with Article 9 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, unless the treatment is not covered by any of the exceptions in Article 9 (2) of the Regulation. It follows from Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation that the controller and the personal data assistant shall take appropriate technical and organizational measures to: ensure a level of safety that is appropriate in relation to the risk of the treatment. This must be done taking into account the latest developments, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment and the risks, of varying degrees of probability and seriousness, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In assessing the appropriate level of safety, special consideration shall be given to the risks involved the treatment entails, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or change or to unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data that transferred, stored or otherwise processed. It is clear from Article 32 (2) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. Recital 75 of the Data Protection Regulation sets out factors that must be taken into account in the assessment of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Among other things, the loss of confidentiality of personal data covered by the obligation of professional secrecy and whether the treatment concerns information about health or sexual life. Furthermore, if the processing concerns personal data about vulnerable natural persons, in particular children, or if the processing involves a large number of personal data and applies to a large number of registered. Recitals 39 and 83 also provide guidance on the more detailed meaning of the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation on security when processing personal data. Page 5 of 10, Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2019-9457 6 (10) Date: 2022-01-26 IMY's assessment Personal data responsibility The Regional Board has stated that it is responsible for personal data for the e- mail transfers described in the case, which is supported by the investigation in the case. IMY therefore assesses that the regional board is responsible for personal data for those concerned the treatments. Sensitive personal data has been sent unencrypted within the region The Regional Board has sent excel files with patient information within the region via e-mail. In the case of the first category of personal data processing, about 25 e-mails were sent mail messages automatically every month and for the second category about 200-250 emails were sent manually per year. The transmission of e- the entry within the region was encrypted but not the information in the excel files. The Regional Board has stated that sensitive personal data may not be communicated via e- mail according to Region Uppsala's governing document on handling mail and e-mail. As the person responsible for personal data, the regional board shall take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security in relation to the risks (Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation). The personal data as treated must, for example, be protected against unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access. What is the appropriate level of security varies in relation to, among other things, the risks for the rights and freedoms of natural persons arising from the treatment and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment. In the assessment must it is taken into account, for example, what type of personal data is processed, to for example, in the case of health information. 3 The current Excel files contained personal health information that is sensitive personal data. Processing of sensitive personal data can mean significant risks to privacy. In addition, the excel files contained social security numbers 4 which are considered to be particularly personal data. The information in e- the mail messages were therefore of such a nature that they required strong protection. The transmission of the e-mail from the regional board was encrypted but not the information in the emails. This meant that the information in the excel files could not be intercepted (read) during the actual transfer. However, the information could be read in clear text by both authorized and unauthorized recipients after the transfer. At an automated transmission, there is a certain risk that data will fall into the wrong hands if the system would be updated incorrectly. In the case of a manual transfer of personal data, there is one more higher risk of the data falling into the wrong hands compared to an automated one transfer. This is because the person sending the information could write one incorrect recipient address. According to IMY's assessment, the regional board should have taken action technical measures, for example in the form of encryption, to protect the information in the automated and the manual e-mails against unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access and thereby ensure an appropriate level of protection. According to the regional board, Region Uppsala's governing document on handling mail states and e-mail that sensitive personal data may not be communicated via e-mail. 3 4See recitals 75 and 76 of the Data Protection Regulation. See Article 87 of the Data Protection Ordinance and Chapter 3. Section 10 of the Data Protection Act. 5See the Swedish Data Inspectorate's report Reported personal data incidents 2019 (report 2020: 2). Page 6 of 10, Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2019-9457 7 (10) Date: 2022-01-26 The Regional Board has thus identified the risks that the treatment of sensitive personal data in e-mail entails but has not taken sufficient measures to comply guidelines. IMY thus finds that the regional board has not taken the appropriate ones organizational measures required to ensure the safety of treatment. Overall, IMY finds that the Regional Board has not taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security in in relation to the risk of the treatment. The Regional Board has therefore considered personal data in breach of Article 32 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. Choice of intervention Legal regulation In the event of violations of the Data Protection Regulation, the IMY has a number of corrections powers available under Article 58 (2) (a) to (j) of the Data Protection Regulation, inter alia reprimand, injunction and penalty fees. IMY shall impose penalty fees in addition to or in lieu of other corrective actions referred to in Article 58 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation, depending on the circumstances of each individual case. Member States may lay down rules on whether and to what extent administrative penalty fees can be imposed on public authorities. It is clear from Article 83 (7) (i) Regulation. Sweden has accordingly decided that the supervisory authority shall receive charge sanction fees by authorities. For infringements of, inter alia, Article 32, the fee amounts to a maximum of SEK 5,000,000. It appears from ch. 6 Section 2 of the Data Protection Act and Article 83 (4) of the Data Protection Regulation. If a personal data controller or a personal data assistant, with respect to a and the same or interconnected data processing, intentionally or by negligence violates several of the provisions of this Regulation may it the total amount of the administrative penalty fee does not exceed the amount determined for the most serious infringement. It is clear from Article 83 (3) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty fees in each individual case are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The provided for in Article 83 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. Article 83 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation sets out the factors to be taken into account in order to: decide whether to impose an administrative penalty fee, but also at determining the amount of the penalty fee. If it is a question of a smaller infringement may IMY as set out in recital 148 instead of imposing a issue a reprimand in accordance with Article 58 (2) (b) of the Regulation. Consideration shall taken to aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the case, such as the infringement character, degree of difficulty and duration as well as previous violations of relevance. Imposition of a penalty fee IMY has above assessed that the regional board has violated Article 32 (1) i the Data Protection Regulation. Infringements of that provision may, as stated above, give rise to penalty fees. Page 7 of 10, Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2019-9457 8 (10) Date: 2022-01-26 The violations have taken place because the regional board has sent a large amount unencrypted patient data within the region via encrypted email. The personal information in the e-mail included sensitive personal information and social security number, which entailed a high risk to the data subjects' freedoms and rights. The treatments have taken place systematically and for a long time. The treatments have also occurred in violation of Region Uppsala's own guidelines. These factors mean overall that a penalty fee should be imposed. IMY states that the manual and the automatic transmission of e-mail constitute interconnected data processing within the meaning of Article 83 (3) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. This is because the treatments concern patient data such as was retrieved from the main journal system Cosmic for similar purposes such as administration and quality assurance. In addition, it is a matter of violation of the same provision, ie Article 32 (1) of the Regulation. In determining the size of the penalty fee, the IMY shall take into account both aggravating and mitigating circumstances and that the administrative penalty fee should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. It is aggravating that the personal data processing has been going on for a long time, that is, during the period under review from 25 May 2018 to 7 May 2019, and that they have taken place systematically. It is also aggravating that the treatments included a large amount of health information that unauthorized persons have been able to access after the transfer. As for the first category of personal data processing, it has been about about 25 emails per month that unauthorized persons have been able to access and in the case of the second category, it has been around 200−250 e- mail messages per year. The Regional Board estimates that the personal data processing has in total touched between 100,000 and 500,000 individuals for the period 2015−2019. It is thus a question of a large number of registered during a year. Through the data processed, the data subjects can be identified directly through, for example, names, social security numbers and health information. IMY therefore considers that the nature, scope of the data and the dependency of the data subjects the regional board has a special responsibility to ensure appropriate protection for personal data, which did not happen. It is also aggravating that the treatments took place in violation of Region Uppsala's own guidelines that sensitive personal data should not be sent by e-mail. As mitigating circumstances, IMY considers that the transmission of the e-mail was encrypted and that the e-mail was sent internally within the region. This means that the regional board has taken certain measures in order to comply with the requirements and reduce them the risks of the treatments. IMY also considers that the regional board stopped the processing in connection with the notification of a personal data incident to IMY on 7 May 2019. IMY decides on the basis of an overall assessment that the regional board must pay one administrative sanction fee of SEK 300,000 (three hundred thousand).

Decision of the Data Protection Authority The Data Protection Authority finds that Bonnier News AB (559080-0917) during the period from 7 November 2019 to 11 June 2020 has processed personal data without having a legal basis for it according to Article 6(1) of the Data Protection Regulation by a) processing personal data for the purpose of profiling the data subjects based on their behavioural data in so-called supplemented behavioural profiles and making the profiles available to affiliated companies for the purpose of displaying customised advertisements, b) processing personal data for the purpose of profile the data subjects based on their behavioral data in so-called simple behavioral profiles and make the profiles available to affiliated companies for the purpose of displaying customized advertisements, c) to process personal data by profiling the data subjects based on their supplemented customer database profiles for the purpose of making contact details available to affiliated companies for telephone sales and postal marketing. The Swedish Data Protection Authority decides, based on Articles 58(2) and 83 of the Data Protection Regulation, that Bonnier News AB shall pay an administrative sanction fee of SEK 13,000,000 (thirteen million). 2. Statement of the supervisory case The Swedish Data Protection Authority (IMY) has, in a supervision of the former Bonnier Magazine and Brands AB, now Expressen Lifestyle (ref. DI-2019-6523), noted that Bonnier News AB, together with other companies within the Bonnier Group, processes personal data for, among other things, marketing purposes based on the legal basis legitimate interest according to Article 6(1)(f) of the Data Protection Regulation. IMY has initiated supervision of Bonnier News AB with the aim of investigating whether Bonnier News AB complies with the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation for the processing of personal data for marketing purposes. Within the framework of this supervision, Bonnier News AB has been asked to comment on seven complaints submitted to IMY regarding various marketing measures taken by companies within the Bonnier Group. Bonnier News AB has commented on the complaints and it has then emerged that the marketing measures taken have not been caused by withdrawals from the group-wide databases nor have they occurred under Bonnier News AB's personal data responsibility. Against this background, IMY does not find any reason to investigate these complaints further within the framework of this case. Within the framework of the supervision, IMY has examined whether Bonnier News AB has a legal basis according to Article 6 of the Data Protection Regulation for the processing of personal data that takes place in the group-wide databases for marketing purposes. The supervision covers the processing of personal data that takes place by creating profiles and making such data available for use by affiliated companies to display customized advertisements. It also covers the processing of personal data, 1Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). 2DI-2018-22602, DI-2019-10121, DI-2019-10513, DI-2019-11057, DI-2019-7484, DI-2019-8104 and DI-2019-9556 4 creation of profiles and making data available to affiliated companies for the purpose of using them for telephone sales and direct mail marketing. IMY has not taken a position on whether Bonnier News AB's personal data processing is otherwise in compliance with the Data Protection Regulation. The supervisory case began with an inspection on 7 November 2019. In connection with IMY sending the inspection report to Bonnier News AB, IMY asked the company additional questions on 20 December 2019. Bonnier submitted comments on the inspection report and submitted responses to IMY's questions on 14 February 2020. On 15 May 2020, IMY asked further additional questions to Bonnier News AB, to which the company submitted responses on 11 June 2020. Due to Bonnier News AB having updated its personal data policy, the company submitted additional information on 21 July 2020. Bonnier News AB has commented on IMY's draft decision on 13 April 2023. Since the case concerns cross-border processing, IMY has used the mechanisms for cooperation and consistency contained in Article 56 and Chapter VII of the Data Protection Regulation. The supervisory authorities concerned have been the authorities in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway and Germany. 2.1 Description of the group-wide personal data processing The following has emerged during the inspection and subsequent correspondence. Within the Bonnier Group, there is a collaboration between Bonnier News AB and a number of affiliated companies that are part of the group (the affiliated companies). Which companies are affiliated changes over time. At the time of the inspection, there were 15 affiliated companies, which drew to 8 during the spring of 2020. The processing of personal data that takes place within the framework of the collaboration is limited to the affiliated companies' customers on the Swedish market. The affiliated companies collect personal data from their customers and people who visit the companies' websites. The collected data is transferred to two group-wide databases, a customer database (KDB) and a behavior database (the behavior database). In these databases, profiles of individuals are created. The profiles are also linked to information obtained from Bisnode Sverige AB. Bonnier News AB has stated that it stores collected data in the group-wide databases for the following purposes: • To establish a common customer register for affiliated companies with good data quality, which includes compiling customer and user data and checking that the data is correct, updated and appropriate • To offer the affiliated companies' customers an easy way to exercise their rights and an opportunity to ask questions about personal data to the joint customer service • To make personal data available to affiliated companies for the purpose of: • Using the contact information of other affiliated companies in order to market the affiliated companies' own products and services through direct mail marketing and telephone sales. 5 • Displaying customized content and customized advertisements in the affiliated companies' digital services, based on the customers' and users' customer profiles and behavior on the affiliated companies' websites. • Perform analysis of customer data in order to use the customer insight obtained to conduct customer communication, marketing of its own products, services and service. • Perform analysis of customer data in order to improve and develop existing services and products. The personal data processing that takes place for the purpose of adapting affiliated companies' advertisements is based on data saved in the behavioral database. The personal data processing that takes place to disclose personal data to affiliated companies for use in telephone sales and direct mail marketing is based on data in the KDB. 2.1.1 Description of the processing of personal data contained in the behavioral database The investigation into the case reveals the following. The data contained in the behavioral database is processed for the purpose of displaying customized content and customized advertisements in the affiliated companies' digital services. When an individual visits an affiliated company's website, the affiliated company collects information about the individual's surfing behavior. This is done by the affiliated company having placed a script on its website that requests to save a text file (cookie) on the visitor's computer, tablet or mobile phone. The information in the cookie can be used to track the user's surfing on the website. The information (behavioral data) that is collected when the individual surfs and then transferred to the behavioral database and added to the individual's profile is: • Information about the URL (web address) of the page visited, its category and a content tag. • Information about the user's device type on which the page was viewed, the browser type and the part of the user's IP address that refers to the country, • Information about behavior in the form of time spent and time of the page view, • Information about a unique randomly generated cookie value (hereinafter referred to as the cookie identifier), • Information about whether the page was viewed in logged-in mode. Bonnier News AB discards the cookie identifier after 30 days and from day 31 the generated behavioral data is no longer used to adapt advertisements to individuals. Data in the behavioral database and in the KDB can in some cases be linked together. 3A content tag is a description of the content that has been consumed in the participating companies' services. Bonnier News AB collects two types of tags, predefined according to the IAB (The Interactive Advertising Bureau) standard and tags produced by the affiliated companies' editorial departments. 6 When the data in the behavioral database cannot be linked with data in the KDB the data subject's behavioral profile consists only of the data specified above, a profile that in this decision will be referred to as a simple behavioral profile. In cases where data in the behavioral database and data in the KDB can be linked together in the behavioral database, data from the KDB on purchase history, gender, age, household additional ownership and postal code, as well as statistical variables based on the individual's residential area such as life stage, purchasing power and housing type are added to the behavioral database. These profiles will hereinafter be referred to in this decision as supplemented behavioral profiles. The data is made available to affiliated companies through a search tool linked to the behavioral database, where the affiliated company can order a segment of customer data based on its chosen variables. An administrator checks whether the order meets certain criteria determined within the collaboration. If so, the affiliated company is given access to a code that makes it possible to target advertisements to users who are included in the segment. The affiliated companies can only retrieve data from the behavioral database based on behavioral data collected from the company's own digital services. This applies regardless of whether it is a simple or supplemented behavioral profile. However, the supplemented behavioral profile may also contain purchase history from other affiliated companies. In the KDB, data is filtered after two years, which is why data older than that cannot be linked to the behavioral database or disclosed to affiliated companies. 2.1.2 Description of the processing of personal data stored in the KDB The investigation into the case reveals the following. The data about individuals in the KDB is processed for the purpose of being used for affiliated companies' marketing of their own products and services through direct mail and telephone sales. When an individual makes a purchase or signs up for a subscription, the affiliated company that has a contractual relationship with the customer collects data from them. Some of this data is transferred to the KDB. In the KDB, information is linked to a profile. In the KDB, the customer profile is assigned a KDB ID. If the affiliated company's customer is already registered in KDB, the existing customer profile is updated/supplemented with the new engagement. Otherwise, a new customer profile is created with a new KDB ID. The information stored in KDB and collected from the customer's contact with the affiliated company is name, address, telephone number, personal identification number, email address and information linked to the customer's purchase, such as product category, brand, type of packaging (whether it is a digital or traditional product and whether it is a free or paid product). The KDB also records whether the customer has objected to the use of information in KDB for marketing purposes and information whether the customer has registered in the so-called NIX register. There are restrictions for the following categories of information: • Information about email addresses is not disclosed to affiliated companies in the case of telephone sales and direct mail marketing. • Personal identification number information is only used to check whether the customer has registered to oppose marketing in the NIX register (NIX blocking) and to check that the customer is not deceased. • Personal identification number information is not made available to the affiliated companies. 7 In addition to the information collected by the affiliated companies, Bonnier News AB collects information from Bisnode Sverige AB for the purpose of checking and supplementing individuals' contact information, and to provide statistical data such as life stage, purchasing power and housing. Furthermore, information on car ownership and on deceased persons is collected as well as information on a so-called GEDI-id (which is a unique identifier in the form of a pseudonymized ID). Information in the KDB and the behavioral database can in some cases also be linked in the KDB. The profile then constitutes what in this decision will be referred to below as a supplemented customer database profile. This is done by a customer of an affiliated company visiting the company's website and logging into their account with the company. The behavioral data that has been collected about the customer and that is linked to a cookie identifier can then, under certain conditions, be linked with the customer's KDB ID. In cases where the customer's KDB ID and the cookie value can be linked, the KDB profile is supplemented with information collected over the past 30 days from the behavioral database. The information that is retrieved is information about which websites the customer has visited, which section of the website the customer has visited (so-called content tags), and which device type the customer has surfed from. Bonnier News AB has limited the type of content tags that companies other than the one whose website the individual surfed can base their profiling on 4 for the purposes of telephone sales and direct mail marketing. When a person ceases to be a customer of an affiliated company, KDB is notified that the customer's engagement has ceased and the customer is flagged as a passive customer. The customer's data is then deleted in KDB after two years. Data obtained from the behavioral database is filtered after 30 days. Any NIX blocking is always activated when contact data in KDB is made available to customers of other affiliated companies and contact data to own customers when these have been passive for 12 months. Data is made available to affiliated companies upon request through an application in KDB. A selection file is created in KDB based on the criteria specified by the affiliated company. Within the framework of the collaboration, something called purpose-adapted schedules are applied. These regulate what information is disclosed from KDB. When disclosed, only the data points defined as necessary for the marketing channel specified at the time of disclosure are disclosed, i.e., for example, telephone numbers in a telephone sales campaign and addresses in postal direct marketing. The data points on which the segmentation is based are not disclosed. The data is made available through an interface in KDB to the affiliated company. The data subject has the option of requesting deletion from KDB. The data subject also has the right to object to the use of the data for telephone sales and postal direct marketing. Bonnier News AB has stated that all affiliated companies are majority-owned by Bonnier Group AB and subject to the Bonnier Group's framework for personal data processing and that only a small portion of the profiles in question have been able to be linked to data in the behavioral database. 4Only tags categorized with the IAB taxonomy are collected. 8 3. Justification of the decision 3.1 IMY's authority 3.1.1 Current circumstances Some of the personal data processed within the group-wide cooperation has been collected by affiliated companies placing a cookie on the visitor's computer, tablet or mobile phone. Bonnier News AB has stated that the collection is done through affiliated companies' websites. The affiliated companies then transfer this information to the behavioral database and in some cases the information is also linked with profile information in KDB. Bonnier News AB has stated that the obligations that followed from the provisions of the Electronic Communications Act (2003:389) and now follow from the Electronic Communications Act (2022:482) (LEK), affect affiliated companies and not Bonnier News AB since it is the companies that are responsible for the actual collection of the data. 3.1.2 Applicable provisions, etc. It follows from Article 95 of the Data Protection Regulation that the Data Protection Regulation shall not entail any additional obligations for natural or legal persons who process personal data, for areas that are already covered by obligations in accordance with the so-called eData Protection Directive. The eData Protection Directive has been implemented in Swedish law through the LEK, which, among other things, regulates the collection of data through cookies. According to Chapter 9 Section 28 of the LEK states that data may be stored in or retrieved from a subscriber's or user's terminal equipment only if the subscriber or user is given access to information about the purpose of the processing and consents to it. It is further stated that this does not prevent such storage or access that is necessary to transmit an electronic message via an electronic communications network or that is necessary to provide a service that the user or subscriber has expressly requested. Before 1 August 2022, when the LEK came into force, the corresponding requirements were set in accordance with Chapter 6, Section 18 of the Electronic Communications Act (2003:389). The Swedish Post and Telecom Agency (PTS) is the supervisory authority under the LEK (Chapter 1, Section 5 of the Electronic Communications Ordinance \[2022:511\]). The EDPB has issued an opinion on the interaction between the ePrivacy Directive and the 6th General Data Protection Regulation. The opinion states, among other things: that the national supervisory authority designated under the ePrivacy Directive is solely competent to monitor compliance with the Directive. However, the supervisory authority under the Data Protection Regulation is the competent supervisory authority for processing not specifically regulated in the ePrivacy Directive. If only part of the processing falls under the ePrivacy Directive, this does not limit the competence of the data protection authority to examine other parts of the processing under the Data Protection Regulation. 7 This means, among other things, that the supervisory authority under the Data Protection Regulation is competent to assess the lawfulness of the processing of personal data that takes place after the data has been retrieved from the individual's terminal equipment, such as the storage of retrieved 5Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications). 6Opinion 5/2019 on the interaction between the Directive on privacy and electronic communications and the General Data Protection Regulation, in particular as regards the competence, tasks and powers of data protection authorities, adopted on 12 March 2019 7See paragraphs 68 and 69 of the Opinion. 9 data and analysis of such data for the purposes of behavioural advertising 8 online. 3.1.3 IMY's assessment The data added to the behavioural database has been collected by the affiliated companies through cookies. The personal data processing examined in this supervisory case is Bonnier News AB's subsequent processing of personal data in the behavioural database. That processing is not covered by the regulation in LEK or the previously applicable regulation in the Act on (2003:389) on electronic communications. This means that the regulations in the Data Protection Regulation apply to the processing and that IMY is the competent supervisory authority. 3.2 Bonnier News AB's personal data responsibility 3.2.1 Current circumstances and Bonnier News AB's position It is Bonnier News AB's opinion that Bonnier News AB and the respective affiliated company have a joint personal data responsibility for the processing that takes place in the KDB and the behavioral database for the purposes stated above as common. Furthermore, Bonnier News AB has stated that Bonnier News AB and affiliated companies have a common view of purposes and means and that Bonnier News AB has entered into a so-called Joint Data Controller Agreement with the affiliated companies in accordance with Article 26(2) of the GDPR. Bonnier News AB has stated that each affiliated company has its own independent (""local"") personal data responsibility for its own collection of data. Bonnier News AB has further stated that it does not have a joint controller for the processing of personal data carried out after the data has been disclosed to affiliated companies from the joint databases. It is the affiliated company that has retrieved the data that is the controller for the processing carried out by this company after the retrieval. 3.2.2 Applicable provisions, etc. According to Article 4(7) of the Data Protection Regulation, the controller is the person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. The fact that purposes and means can be determined by more than one actor means that several actors can be controllers for the same processing. According to Article 4(2) of the Data Protection Regulation, processing is an action or combination of actions concerning personal data or sets of personal data. In the Fashion-ID case, the CJEU held that a website operator who uses social network plug-ins on its website may become a joint controller with the social network. This applies to the collection and disclosure by transmission of personal data of website visitors that takes place using the social network plug-in. The CJEU also stated that each party is only responsible for those parts of the processing chain for which it actually determined the purposes and means. 8 See paragraph 75 of the Opinion. 9 See judgment in Fashion-ID, C-40/17, EU:C:2019:629, paragraphs 64-85 10 In the Wirtschaftsakademie case, the CJEU stated that joint responsibility for processing does not necessarily mean that the different actors involved in the processing of personal data have the same responsibility. On the contrary, these actors may be involved at different stages of the processing of personal data to varying degrees, and the level of responsibility of each must be assessed taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the individual case. 3.2.3 IMY's assessment Bonnier News AB provides two databases, the KDB and the behavioral database, where information from affiliated companies is combined into profiles of individuals. Under the conditions determined by Bonnier News AB and the companies, the information is made available to Bonnier News AB and the respective affiliated company. IMY notes that, in addition to making the databases available to the affiliated companies, Bonnier News AB has, together with the companies, set up the framework for the processing in various ways. IMY therefore assesses that Bonnier News AB is jointly controller of personal data with the affiliated companies for the part of the personal data processing that takes place for the common purposes of making personal data, through profiling of individuals' data, available to affiliated companies to display customized advertisements and for use in telephone sales and direct mail marketing. This includes the collection of data for the databases, the storage in the databases and the profiling, the collection of additional data from Bisnode Sverige AB, the connection between the behavioral database and KDB, and the transfer of data between the databases. Furthermore, Bonnier News AB is jointly responsible for personal data with the affiliated companies for the actions taken prior to and in the event of disclosure to an affiliated company. 3.3 What data constitutes personal data? 3.3.1 Current circumstances and Bonnier News AB's position The section ""Description of the group-wide personal data processing"" states that a large amount of data collected from individuals is processed in the KDB and the joint behavioral database. Bonnier News AB believes that what is referred to in this decision as a supplemented behavioral profile constitutes personal data. However, data in the behavioral database - which cannot be linked with data in the KDB - constitutes anonymous behavioral data according to Bonnier News AB. This is because they cannot be linked to a person either via KDB-ID, customer ID, IP address or any other identifier for a person. Bonnier News AB therefore believes that the behavioral profiles referred to in this decision as simple behavioral profiles do not constitute personal data. According to Bonnier News AB, the segmentation made on these simple profiles is only based on the affiliated company's own collected information in the behavioral database (a company can, for example, choose to adapt sports-related content and advertisements to the information registered via a cookie over the last 30 days). 3.3.2 Applicable provisions and other general starting points According to Article 4(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (i.e. the data subject). The same provision states that an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data or online identifiers or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. According to recital 26 of the GDPR, the principles of data protection should apply to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data which have been pseudonymised and which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of supplementary information should be considered as data relating to an identifiable natural person. In order to determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means, such as screening, which, either by the controller or by another person, can reasonably be used to directly or indirectly identify the natural person. In order to determine whether means can reasonably be used to identify the natural person, all objective factors, such as the cost and time required for identification, should be taken into account, taking into account both the technology available at the time of the processing and the state of the art. According to recital 26, the principles of data protection should not apply to anonymous information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person, or to personal data which has been rendered anonymous in such a way that the data subject is no longer identifiable. The Regulation therefore does not concern the processing of such anonymous information, which includes information for statistical or research purposes. According to recital 30 of the Data Protection Regulation, natural persons may be linked to online identifiers provided by their equipment, applications, tools and protocols, e.g. IP addresses, cookies or other identifiers, such as radio frequency tags. This may leave traces which, in particular in combination with unique identifiers and other data received by the servers, can be used to create profiles of natural persons and identify them. 11 An opinion of the Article 29 Working Party, which contains an analysis of the concept of personal data, states that a natural person in a group is considered to be “identified” when he or she can be “distinguished” from other individuals in some way. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), in its guidelines on targeted advertising in social media, has stated that even individuals who use a social media service without having created an account or profile with the social media service may constitute data subjects within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the GDPR if the person is directly or indirectly identified or identifiable. The EDPB has referred to the concept of “thinning” in recital 26 of the GDPR and to the above-mentioned opinion of the Article 29 Working Party. The Article 29 Working Party’s opinion on online behavioural advertising further elaborates on what it means to be identifiable: The Article 29 Working Party notes that behavioural advertising often leads to the processing of personal data. Behavioural advertising typically involves the collection of IP addresses and the processing of unique identifiers (through the cookie). The use of such functions with a unique identifier makes it 11The so-called Article 29 Working Party was an advisory and independent working party consisting of representatives of the supervisory authorities in the EU and the EEA. , The working party was tasked with contributing to the uniform application of the Data Protection Directive through, among other things, recommendations. On 25 May 2018, the working party was replaced by the European Data Protection Board, the EDPB. 12See WP 136. Article 29 Working Party Opinion 4/2007 on the concept of personal data, adopted on 20 June 2007, p. 12 f 13See EDPB Guidelines 8/2020 on targeted advertising in social media Version 2.0, adopted on 13 April 2021, p. 19 12 allow users of a particular computer to be tracked even if dynamic IP addresses are used. In other words, such features make it possible to “point out” individual data subjects, even if their names are not known. Moreover, the information collected in the context of behavioural advertising relates to (i.e. concerns) the characteristics or behaviour of a person and is used to influence that specific person. This view is further strengthened if one considers the possibility that profiles can be linked at any time to directly identifiable information provided by the data subject, such as information provided when registering on a website. Other scenarios that can lead to identifiability are mergers, data losses and the growing availability on the Internet of personal data linked to IP addresses. 14 3.3.3 IMY's assessment IMY initially notes that the supplemented behavioural profiles (i.e. behavioural profiles linked to KDB) contain data relating to identified or identifiable natural persons. The supplemented behavioural profiles are thus personal data. With regard to the simple behavioural profiles (i.e. behavioural profiles without a link to KDB), IMY makes the following assessment. In order for a piece of data to qualify as personal data, it is first required that the data relates to a natural person. This requirement is met with regard to simple behavioural profiles since the data describes how the individual surfed with a number of different parameters. Furthermore, it is required that the natural person is identified or identifiable. Article 4(1) of the GDPR states that it is sufficient that a person can be identified indirectly. The provision further states that identification can be made by reference to an online identifier. Recital 30 of the GDPR lists cookies (in the English version) as an example of online identifiers. Identification within the meaning of Article 4(1) can thus be made by means of such unique cookie values used in the behavioural database. IMY further notes that recital 26 of the GDPR states that selection is a way of identifying a person. This means that a person can be identified by being distinguished from other persons. It is therefore not required that the person be identified by name or personal identification number. Such selection or selection occurs when the information processed makes it possible to identify, draw conclusions about or take specific measures in relation to a user. In the behavioral database, the information is linked to a unique identifier, a unique cookie value, which is linked to a specific browser or app, which in turn is linked to a device such as a computer or phone. One of the purposes of the processing of the data is to target marketing to a user based on the user's behavior based on that user's previous behavior in an identified browser or app. The purpose of the processing is thus to draw conclusions about the individual by creating a profile and based on this to influence the individual. IMY thus states that even the simple behavioral profiles that are not linked to the KDB mean that individuals are identifiable. 14See WP 171, Article 29 Working Party Opinion 2/2010 on online behavioural advertising, adopted on 22 June 2010, p. 9 f 15See WP 136. f Article 29 Working Party Opinion 4/2007 on the concept of personal data, adopted on 20 June 2007, p. 12 13 In this context, IMY assesses that simple behavioural profiles constitute personal data. 3.4 Processing constitutes profiling 3.4.1 Applicable provisions Profiling is defined in Article 4(4) of the GDPR as any form of automatic processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to assess certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, whereabouts or movements. 3.4.2 IMY's assessment IMY notes that both the processing of personal data based on simple behavioral profiles and supplemented behavioral profiles for the purpose of making the data available to affiliated companies for the purpose of displaying tailored advertisements includes profiling of data subjects as defined in Article 4(4) of the GDPR. This is because it involves the automated processing of personal data aimed at categorizing data subjects based on their previous behavioral patterns, which in turn makes it possible to assess certain of their personal characteristics. IMY further notes that the processing of personal data for the purpose of making contact details available for telemarketing and direct mail marketing includes profiling of data subjects as defined in Article 4(4) of the GDPR. This is because it involves the automated processing of personal data aimed at categorizing data subjects based on their purchase history and, in some cases, behavioral patterns. 3.5 Legal basis for processing for the purpose of displaying customized advertisements based on data in the behavioral database 3.5.1 Current circumstances and Bonnier News AB's position Bonnier News AB has stated that it has coordinated its activities within the group to achieve a better data basis and make it possible to process customers' and users' personal data for specified purposes in a cost-effective and privacy-friendly manner. Bonnier News AB uses its profiling of individuals to make information available to affiliated companies for the purpose of displaying customized advertisements, partly on collected behavioral data that cannot be linked to the KDB, partly on behavioral data where such a connection can be made and where additional personal data has been added to the data subject's profile. Bonnier News AB supports its processing of information to make information available to affiliated companies for the purpose of displaying customized advertisements on the legal basis of Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation. Legitimate interest Bonnier News AB has stated the following. The company has a legitimate interest consisting of a need to understand the wishes and needs of its customers and users in order to be able to achieve relevance in content and advertising aimed at customers and users and thereby be able to offer competitive products/services and attractive advertising space. Many of the affiliated companies are also engaged in journalistic activities. The operating model of 14 publishers today consists of revenue streams from reader and advertising revenue. The group-wide processing of personal data is important for the financing of the companies' journalistic activities. Bonnier News AB has also pointed to the protection of media freedom and diversity in Article 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Necessary processing Bonnier News AB has stated that the processing of personal data is necessary to achieve the purposes of making individuals' profiles available to affiliated companies in order to display tailored advertisements. The company, together with the other companies, has taken measures to minimize the amount of data collected and limited how long this data is processed, and ensured that the databases are kept separate and that only certain data is transferred between them. Balancing of interests Bonnier News AB has stated the following. Bonnier News AB's interest outweighs the individual's interest in protecting their personal data. Processing personal data to display customized advertisements based on the individual's profile is a basic requirement for journalists and publishers to be able to receive revenue and, in the long run, to be able to conduct journalism. It is possible to object to profiling based on behavioral data. According to the information that individuals receive in Bonnier News AB's personal data policy, the individual can object to information about their online behavior being processed in the 16 common customer database. This means that the connection between the individual's customer data and their surfing behavior is removed. The data subjects have a direct relationship with one or more affiliated companies. The users/customers have either visited the website of an affiliated company, purchased products from an affiliated company or an active digital subscription. Many of the customers are subscribers who have a long-term relationship with the company that provides the service or product and can therefore be considered to have a greater expectation that their data will be processed. Many readers have a strong commitment linked to their preference for news media. To some extent, customer profiles in KDB belong to piece purchases such as literature, newspaper and goods purchases. In these cases, the relationship between customer and supplier can be considered to be somewhat less unique. Furthermore, the interaction is voluntary, clear information is provided and there are alternative products such as physical newspapers that can be viewed completely anonymously. The processing is unlikely to have any negative impact on the data subject's interest. Individuals' interaction with affiliated companies is voluntary and it is in their interest that the companies' services are as relevant as possible. Furthermore, Bonnier News AB has referred to the fact that the Article 29 Working Party has found that targeted marketing based on simple customer profiles, such as gender, age, place of residence and broad interests (e.g. ""fashion"") typically does not have a significant impact on individuals. Bonnier News AB has also taken measures to ensure that a minimum of data is processed in relation to the purposes and to reduce privacy risks in general. Among other things, personal data is not shared with companies other than the affiliated companies within the group and 16The version of Bonnier News AB's personal data policy that was submitted on July 21, 2020, see under the heading ""How you can access and control your personal data"", attachment 20.1. 15 All of these companies are subject to the Bonnier Group's framework for personal data processing. The current processing is within the reasonable expectations of the data subjects because the individuals who come into contact with the companies do so of their own free will in order to participate in content on websites, purchase services and/or products and that they always have a customer/user relationship with one or more companies in the group. The companies' personal data policies contain clear information about how customers' and users' personal data is processed and shared within the group. The processing carried out within the framework of the KDB and the behavioral database is closely linked to the companies' services and products, which is likely to have an impact on the consumer's expectations. The fact that many of the companies' products and services are online and in many cases free or financed by advertising is likely to entail a particular expectation and acceptance of certain personal data processing for, among other things, adaptation of content and advertising. Today, many digital products consumed by a very large portion of consumers in society are also tailored to the individual, and it is Bonnier News AB's opinion that today's consumers expect that the digital products and services that they consume will to some extent be tailored to the individual. 3.5.2 Applicable provisions, etc. Personal data shall be processed lawfully, fairly and transparently in relation to the data subject, in accordance with Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR. The fact that the data shall be processed lawfully means, among other things, that at least one of the conditions set out in Article 6(1) is met. Consent is, according to Article 6(1)(a), one of the legal bases on which a data controller can base its processing of personal data. Another legal basis is legitimate interest according to Article 6(1)(f), which requires that three cumulative conditions are met. There must be (i) a legitimate interest of the controller or of a third party to whom the data are disclosed, (ii) the processing of personal data must be necessary for the legitimate interest pursued, and (iii) the data subject's interest in the protection of his or her personal data must not be overridden. 18 Recital 47 of the GDPR states that a legitimate interest may, for example, exist where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller, for example if the data subject is a customer of the controller. It states that the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be considered a legitimate interest. It further states that a legitimate interest requires a careful assessment, which includes whether the data subject can reasonably expect, at the time and in connection with the collection of the personal data, that processing for the specified purpose may take place. In particular, the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could be overridden if personal data are processed in circumstances where the data subject cannot reasonably expect any further processing. According to Chapter 9, Section 28 of the LEK, which implements Article 5(3) of the eData Protection Directive into Swedish law, data may be stored in or retrieved from the terminal equipment of users or subscribers only if the subscriber or user is given access to information about the purpose of the processing and consents to it. This does not prevent such storage or access that is necessary for the transmission of an electronic message via an electronic communications network or that is necessary for the provision of a service that the user or subscriber has expressly requested. The corresponding requirement previously applied according to Chapter 6, Section 18 of the Electronic Communications Act (2003:389). The EDPB Guidelines on Connected Vehicles state that data collected on the basis of consent in accordance with Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive or subject to the exceptions in Article 5(3) of that Directive may only be further processed for another purpose if the controller requests further consent or is supported by Union or Member State law. The EDPB further states that such further processing cannot rely on a compatibility test under Article 6(4) of the GDPR as it would undermine the protection of the ePrivacy Directive. Furthermore, the EDPB states that consent, where required by the ePrivacy Directive, must be specific and informed, meaning that data subjects must be aware of each purpose of the processing and have the right to object for specific purposes. If further processing on the basis of a compatibility test under Article 6(4) of the GDPR were possible, the very principle of the consent requirements in the current Directive would be circumvented. 20 The EDPB Guidelines on targeted advertising in social media divide personal data into the following categories: data that the data subject has actively and knowingly provided to the controller, data observed by the data subject through the use of the service or device, and inferred and derived data created on the basis of data provided by the data subject. According to the EDPB, there are two legal bases for processing such data that the data subject has actively and knowingly provided, namely consent under Article 6(1)(a) and legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. In the case of data collected through observed data provided by the data subject through the use of a service or device, including that collected through cookies, the EDPB states that Article 6(1)(f) cannot constitute a legal basis for such targeted advertising where individuals are tracked across multiple websites and locations. 22 The EDPB further states that for such processing, consent is likely to be the most appropriate legal basis under Article 6 of the GDPR. The assessment should also take into account that the processing includes activities for which the EU legislator has sought to provide additional protection. 23 The EDPB has stated in its guidelines on consent that if controllers choose to rely on consent for any part of the processing, they must be prepared to respect this choice and stop that part of the processing if an individual withdraws their consent. It would be fundamentally unfair to data subjects to give the message that data will be processed based on consent while actually referring to a different legal basis. In other words, the controller may not switch the legal basis from consent to other legal grounds. The EDPB further states that, for example, it is not permissible to retroactively use legitimate interest as a ground to justify processing if there have been problems in obtaining valid consent. Due to the requirement that data controllers must 19See Guidelines 01/2020 on the processing of personal data in the context of connected vehicles and 20relevant applications, Version 2.0, Adopted on 9 March 2021, paragraph 53 21See previous note 22See EDPB Guidelines 8/2020 on targeted advertising in social media Version 2.0, adopted on 13 April 2021, paragraph 40 See previous note, paragraph 77 23See previous note, paragraph 78 17 state the legal basis when collecting personal data, they must have determined the legal basis before collecting the data. 24 An opinion from the Article 29 Working Party on the concept of legitimate interest in Directive 95/46/EC states that when carrying out the balancing of interests, the type of interest invoked, the harm that would be suffered by the controller if the data were not processed, the nature of the data, how the personal data are processed, the position of the data subjects and the position of the controller, the reasonable expectations of the data subjects as to what will happen to their data and the consequences for the data subjects should be taken into account. If, after analysing the above factors, it is still unclear how this balancing will turn out, the design of so-called additional safeguards may be decisive for the outcome of the balancing of interests. 25 The Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on Automated Individual Decision-Making and Profiling provide guidance on when profiling can be based on legitimate interests under 6.1 f. According to the guidelines, the following factors are relevant: • The level of detail of the profile. • The extent of the profile. • The consequences of the profiling. • The safeguards intended to ensure a fair, non- discriminatory and accurate profiling process. The Article 29 Working Party has reiterated in several opinions its position that it is difficult to rely on Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR for such profiling that takes place for marketing or advertising purposes when individuals are tracked across several 26 different websites, locations, devices, services or for data brokering activities. 3.5.3 Basis for IMY's assessment Bonnier News AB supports its processing of personal data for the purpose of making individuals' profiles available to affiliated companies for the purpose of displaying tailored advertisements on the legal basis of legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. Before IMY examines whether the legal basis can constitute a basis for Bonnier News AB's processing, IMY finds it necessary to address how the processing relates to certain statements made in the EDPB guidelines. The EDPB guidelines on targeted advertising in social media state that, when it comes to data that the data subject has actively and knowingly provided, both consent and legitimate interest can constitute a legal basis for the processing. The guidelines state, however, that for data collected through observation (for example, through cookies), legitimate interest cannot serve as an appropriate legal basis when the targeted advertising is based on individuals being tracked across multiple websites and locations. 24 See EDPB Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Version 1.1, adopted on 4 May 2020, 25points 122-123 See Article 29 Working Party Opinion 6/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests of the controller in Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC 26See Article 29 Working Party Opinion Guidelines on automated individual decision-making and profiling under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, adopted on 3 October 2017, p.15 and Article 29 Working Party Opinion 6/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests of the controller in Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC, adopted on 9 April 2014, p. 47, and the examples on pp. 59–60 and EDPB Guidelines 8/2020 on targeted advertising in social media Version 2.0, adopted 13 April 2021 p. 77 18 IMY notes that Bonnier News AB collects data for its behavioral database from several different websites, but an affiliated company can only retrieve data based on behavioral data collected from the company's own digital services. This applies regardless of whether it is a simple or supplemented behavioral profile. The EDPB Guidelines on connected vehicles state that data collected on the basis of consent pursuant to 5.3 of the ePrivacy Directive can only be further processed for another purpose if the data controller requests additional consent or the processing is supported by EU law or national regulation. The section on the interaction between consent and other legal bases in Article 6 of the EDPB Guidelines on consent also addresses the issue of when the data subject has been informed that they have obtained the rights conferred by consent and the unfairness of not respecting these by referring to another legal basis. IMY notes that the situation in the case differs to some extent from that described in these guidelines. In the case in point, it is the affiliated companies that collect the data pursuant to 5.3 of the ePrivacy Directive and are thus subject to the requirement for consent in that provision. The affiliated companies must ensure that they have legal grounds for their processing pursuant to 5.3 of the ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR. The affiliated companies’ processing of personal data is not covered by this supervision. It is therefore not Bonnier News AB that collects the data on the basis of consent pursuant to the national provisions implementing Article 5.3 of the ePrivacy Directive. It is only when the affiliated companies enter the personal data into the behavioral database and KDB that Bonnier News AB's processing begins. Bonnier News AB therefore does not change the legal basis from consent to legitimate interest. IMY also notes that Bonnier News AB is part of the same group as the affiliated companies and that Bonnier News AB is jointly responsible for personal data with the affiliated companies for the processing of personal data in the databases. The fact that group-wide databases have been established should not mean that the data subjects receive less protection than if the processing had taken place at the group company that collected the personal data. In other words, Bonnier News AB should not have greater opportunities to process personal data on the basis of the legal basis of legitimate interest than the affiliated companies have. According to IMY, the guidelines presented above should therefore be of importance for the assessment of the possibility of using legitimate interest as a legal basis in the case. From the above, it can be concluded that the scope, based on Article 6(1)(f) of the Data Protection Regulation, to further process data collected on the basis of consent according to LEK is very limited. At the same time, it can be stated that the GDPR does not prohibit the use of Article 6(1)(f) as a legal basis for the current form of processing. IMY therefore proceeds to examine whether the processing is supported by Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. IMY's examination of whether Bonnier News AB is supported by Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR is based on the three conditions that must be met according to the provision: (i) Is there a legitimate interest of the controller or a third party to whom the data is disclosed? (ii) Is the processing of personal data necessary for the legitimate interest pursued? 19 (iii) Does the data subject's interest in the protection of his or her personal data outweigh the interests of the data subject? IMY treats the first two steps in the balancing of interests jointly for the supplemented and simple behavioral profiles (sections 3.5.3 and 3.5.4). Then, the third and final step is treated separately for the supplemented behavioral profiles (section 3.5.5) and the simple behavioral profiles (section 3.5.6). 3.5.4 Legitimate interest Bonnier News AB's interest in creating profiles to make data available to affiliated companies to display tailored advertisements is of a commercial nature. The fact that an interest is commercial does not exclude that the interest is legitimate, but the decisive factor for this assessment is whether the interest is legitimate, specific and constitutes a real and actual interest.7 Bonnier News AB's and affiliated companies' interest is legitimate, real and actual. IMY therefore finds that Bonnier News AB's interest in creating profiles for making available and the interest of the affiliated companies in processing personal data to display customized advertisements based on customers' and users' customer profiles and behavioral profiles is justified. 3.5.5 Is the processing necessary for the legitimate interest? The requirement of necessity in Article 6(1)(f) of the Data Protection Regulation shall be examined together with the principle of data minimization in Article 5(1)(c). The purpose of the processing is to make data available to affiliated companies to display customized advertisements based on individuals' profiles. In the case, it has emerged that Bonnier News AB together with the affiliated companies have taken measures to minimize the amount of data collected and limit how long this data is processed and ensured that the databases in which the data is processed are kept separate and that only certain data is transferred between them. Against this background, IMY finds that the processing described in this decision is necessary for the stated purpose. 3.5.6 The balance of interests for the processing of personal data in supplemented behavioral profiles Bonnier News AB's interest in creating profiles to make data available to affiliated companies to display customized advertisements can, according to the company, benefit the individual either by higher revenues enabling free or cheaper services or by the individual being met with offers that they are interested in. Bonnier News AB has further emphasised that many of the affiliated companies are engaged in journalistic activities and that the current operating model of publishers consists of revenue streams from reader and advertisement revenues and that the group-wide processing of personal data is important for the financing of the companies' journalistic activities. Against this background, the company has assessed that its interest weighs particularly heavily. As IMY has already stated, the interest in displaying tailored advertisements is legitimate within the meaning of Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. As regards the question of how much weight this interest carries, IMY states that the interest is not journalistic in itself, but rather commercial in nature. Profiling creates knowledge about customers and potential customers that enables revenue from tailored advertising. IMY considers that Bonnier 27See Opinion 6/2014 of the Article 29 Working Party on the concept of legitimate interests of the controller in Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC 28See judgment in Asociaţia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA, C-708/18, EU:C:2019:1064, paragraph 48 20 News AB and its affiliated companies do not carry as much weight as Bonnier News AB claims. When assessing the interests of the data subjects, IMY takes the following into account. As stated above, Bonnier News AB collects personal data in the behavioral database that was originally collected by the affiliated companies through 29 cookies. The consent requirement that applies under Chapter 9, Section 28 of the LEK for that collection provides strong privacy protection and an opportunity for the data subjects to control the use of the collected data. This protection risks, as the EDPB has stated in several of its guidelines, being undermined if the collected personal data is processed on the basis of other legal grounds, such as legitimate interest pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. As IMY has already stated, Bonnier News AB should not have a greater opportunity than the affiliated companies to invite the legal basis of legitimate interest for the processing of the personal data that the affiliated companies have collected using cookies. IMY therefore believes that the nature of the data means that the interests of the data subjects should be given great weight in the balancing of interests. Furthermore, IMY considers that the scope for using Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR as a legal basis for profiling based on observed data is limited (cf. EDPB Guidelines 8/2020 on targeted advertising in social media, p. 77– 78). IMY therefore notes that the nature of the processing also means that the privacy interests of the data subjects weigh heavily. Bonnier News AB has emphasized that profiling and customized advertisements can benefit the data subject by enabling higher revenues for the affiliated companies, which in turn enables them to offer free or cheaper services. It can also benefit the data subject by presenting them with offers that they are interested in. IMY does not dispute that the processing may to some extent benefit the data subjects, but considers that the overall interest of profiling is to create advertising that is as accurate as possible in order to get customers and potential customers to purchase goods or services and to generate revenue from such advertising. In cases where behavioral data can be linked to KDB for the purpose of displaying customized advertisements (the so-called supplemented behavioral profiles), IMY considers the following in its assessment. Although data for profiling is not collected from different websites, which according to the EDPB guidelines would make Article 6(1)(f) of the Data Protection Regulation not an appropriate legal basis, the profiling instead includes data collected from other contexts such as previous purchases, demographic data collected and statistical data. IMY considers that profiling is extensive in nature and that such profiling is not something a data subject can expect without having consented to such personal data processing. IMY considers, on a balanced assessment, that the privacy interests of the data subject outweigh the interests of Bonnier News AB and the affiliated companies. Against this background, IMY finds that Bonnier News AB has processed personal data in violation of Article 6(1) of the Data Protection Regulation for the purpose of profiling the 29At the time of the case, the same requirements applied according to Chapter 6, Section 18 of the Electronic Communications Act (2003:389). 21 registered persons based on their behavioral data in a so-called supplemented behavioral profile and making the profiles available to affiliated companies for the purpose of displaying customized advertisements. 3.5.7 Balancing of interests for the processing of personal data in simple behavioral profiles As IMY stated above in section 3.5.4, Bonnier News AB's interest in creating profiles to make data available to affiliated companies to display customized advertisements is a commercial interest that does not weigh as heavily as Bonnier News AB claims. When assessing the interests of the data subjects, IMY considers the following. Bonnier News AB has taken measures to minimize the amount of data collected, introduced privacy-enhancing rules for segmentation, introduced filtering rules and ensured that data collected from an affiliated company can only be used by that company. Profiling thus only takes place on a company's ""own visitors"". Furthermore, Bonnier News AB informs about the current processing through its personal data policy. This should be weighed against the fact that the collection and profiling of simple behavioral profiles enables the mapping of individuals through observed data, which entails a greater invasion of privacy than when the data is collected through the active participation of the data subject. IMY believes that the data subject's privacy interest is strong due to the nature of the data (that the collection of the data is given special protection in the LEK). As IMY has already stated, Bonnier News AB should not have a greater opportunity than the affiliated companies to invoke the legal basis of legitimate interest for the processing of the personal data that the affiliated companies have collected using cookies. Furthermore, IMY believes that when individuals' surfing behavior is monitored to display tailored advertising, this can give the data subject the feeling of losing control over their data and the feeling of being monitored. This can result in individuals being influenced in their choice of what they see on a website. IMY considers, on a balanced assessment, that the privacy interests of the data subject outweigh the interests of Bonnier News AB and affiliated companies even when processing personal data in simple behavioral profiles because this enables profiling of individuals. Against this background, IMY states that Bonnier News AB has processed personal data without having a legal basis for it according to Article 6(1) of the GDPR for the purpose of profiling the data subjects based on their behavioral data in so-called simple behavioral profiles and making the profiles available to affiliated companies for the purpose of displaying customized advertisements. 3.6 Legal basis for processing for the purpose of making contact details available for telephone sales and direct mail marketing 3.6.1 Applicable provisions, etc. In order to be able to rely on Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, the three conditions stated in the article must, as stated above, be met. There must be a legitimate interest of the controller or of the third party to whom the data are disclosed, the processing of personal data must be necessary for the 22 legitimate interest pursued and the data subject's interest in the protection of his or her personal data must not outweigh it. 30 The Article 29 Working Party and the EDPB's guidelines on profiling and the application of Article 6 have been described in section 3.5. 3.6.2 Current circumstances and Bonnier News AB's position Bonnier News AB has stated that the group has coordinated its activities to achieve a better data basis and enable the processing of customers' and users' personal data for the specified purposes in a cost-effective and privacy-friendly manner. Bonnier News AB profiles data subjects with the aim of making the data available for telephone sales and direct mail marketing. The profiling that this entails is based partly on data in KDB collected from affiliated companies in connection with purchases and subscriptions (so-called customer engagement), partly on data obtained from Bisnode Sverige AB and, for a small part of the profiles, data from the behavioral database. Bonnier News AB bases its processing on Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. Legitimate interest Bonnier News AB has stated that the affiliated companies have a legitimate interest in marketing their products and services in an efficient and privacy-friendly manner. Necessary processing Bonnier News AB has stated that, together with the affiliated companies, they have taken measures to minimize the amount of data collected, how long this data is processed and, in order to comply with the data minimization principle, have kept the databases separate and only transferred certain data. Furthermore, Bonnier News AB has taken measures so that no more information than is necessary is disclosed to the affiliated companies. When disclosing, only the data points that are defined as necessary for the marketing channel specified at the time of disclosure are disclosed, i.e. for example, telephone numbers in a telephone sales campaign and addresses in postal direct marketing. The data points on which the segmentation is based are not disclosed. The balance of interests Bonnier News AB has stated the following. Bonnier News AB's interest in making information available to affiliated companies based on the data subject's profile for use in telephone sales and postal direct marketing outweighs the data subject's privacy interest. By utilizing the Group's existing resources for telephone sales and postal direct marketing, instead of purchasing the same information/resource from an external party, a cost saving occurs while enabling a more controlled degree of utilization of addresses and telephone numbers than would otherwise have been possible. The processing is also intended to save purchasing costs. Bonnier News AB, together with the affiliated companies, has taken measures to minimize the amount of data collected, limit how long this data is processed and, in order to comply with the data minimization principle, keep the databases separate. For the purposes of telephone sales and direct mail marketing, Bonnier News 30EU Court of Justice judgment Fashion ID, C-40/17, EU:C:2019:629, paragraph 95. 23 AB has limited the type of content tags generated by the data subject's surfing of other companies' websites. Furthermore, a connection between the databases has only been made for a small percentage of users. Furthermore, something called purpose-adapted schemes is applied within the framework of the collaboration. These regulate what information is disclosed from the KDB. When disclosing, only the data points defined as necessary for the marketing channel specified at the time of disclosure are disclosed, for example, telephone numbers in the case of a telephone sales campaign and addresses in the case of postal direct marketing. The data points on which the segmentation is based are not disclosed. There is a specific possibility for the data subject to request deletion from the common database. The data subject also has the right to object to the data being used for telephone sales and postal direct marketing. The data subjects have a direct relationship with one or more affiliated companies. The users/customers have either visited the website of an affiliated company, purchased products from an affiliated company or have an active digital subscription. Many of the customers are subscribers who have a long-term relationship with the company that provides the service or product, and can therefore be considered to have a greater expectation that their data will be processed. Many readers have a strong commitment tied to their preference for news media. To some extent, customer profiles in KDB belong to piece purchases such as literature, newspaper and goods purchases, where the relationship between customer and supplier can be considered somewhat less unique. Furthermore, the interaction is voluntary, clear information is provided and there are alternative products such as physical newspapers that can be viewed completely anonymously. According to Bonnier News AB, the processing does not likely have a negative impact on the interests of the data subject. The processing that takes place is within the reasonable expectations of the data subjects because the individuals who come into contact with the companies do so of their own free will in order to access content on websites, purchase services and/or products and that they always have a customer/user relationship with one or more group companies. Furthermore, the companies' personal data policies contain clear information about how customers' and users' personal data is processed and shared within the group. The processing carried out within the framework of the KDB/behavioral database is closely linked to the companies' services and products, which should be of importance for the consumer's expectations. The fact that a group coordinates systems and central functions and shares certain data for efficiency reasons should not be unexpected for the data subjects. Customers who have not registered with the NIX register have a reasonable expectation that their contact details may be used for direct mail marketing or telephone sales. Consumers are used to this type of marketing. The group-wide policy provides information on direct marketing and telephone sales. It states that addresses and telephone numbers can be used by the Bonnier companies for direct mail marketing and telephone sales. It also states that the Bonnier companies can select segments that they believe are relevant for the current campaign, e.g. ""men in the age range of 40-45 living in Stockholm"". It also appears that the Bonnier companies always respect NIX restrictions and whether anyone has objected to the marketing. 31Only tags categorized with the IAB taxonomy are collected. 24 3.6.3 IMY's assessment IMY treats the first two steps in the balancing of interests jointly for the supplemented and simple behavioral profiles (sections 3.6.4 and 3.6.5). The third and final step is then treated separately for the supplemented behavioral profiles (section 3.6.6) and the simple behavioral profiles (section 3.6.7). 3.6.4 Is Bonnier News AB's interest in profiling individuals for the purpose of making data available to affiliated companies for use in telephone sales and direct mail marketing justified? Bonnier News AB's interest in creating profiles to make the data available to affiliated companies for use in telephone sales and postal direct marketing is of a commercial nature. IMY assesses that the companies' interest is legitimate, real and actual with Bonnier News AB and the affiliated companies to which the data is disclosed. Against this background, IMY assesses that the company's interest in creating profiles to make data available to affiliated companies for use in telephone sales and postal direct marketing is justified. 3.6.5 Is the processing necessary for the interest in profiling individuals for the purpose of making data available to companies for use in telephone sales and postal direct marketing? The requirement of necessity in Article 6(1)(f) of the Data Protection Regulation shall be examined together with the principle of data minimization in Article 5. The purpose of the processing is to make data available to companies for use in telephone sales and direct mail marketing. In the case, it has emerged that Bonnier News AB, together with the other companies, has taken measures to minimize the amount of data collected and to limit the period for which this data is processed, and has ensured that the databases in which the data is processed are kept separate and that only certain data is transferred between them. Furthermore, the company has ensured that no more data than is necessary is disclosed to the affiliated companies for use in telephone sales and direct mail marketing. Against this background, IMY finds that the processing is necessary for the legitimate purpose. 3.6.6 Balancing of interests for the processing of personal data in supplemented customer database profiles Bonnier News AB has emphasized that the affiliated companies have an interest in marketing their products and services in an efficient and privacy-friendly manner. IMY notes, however, that the interest in making data available for use in telephone sales and direct mail marketing is a commercial interest that does not weigh particularly heavily. When assessing the interests of the data subjects, IMY considers the following. The profiling carried out on the supplemented customer database profiles includes data collected from affiliated companies when purchasing and subscribing (so-called customer engagement), data obtained from Bisnode Sverige AB and data from the behavioral database (including data collected by the affiliated companies through cookies). IMY has already stated above that Bonnier News AB should not have a greater opportunity than the affiliated companies to invoke the legal basis of legitimate interest when processing personal data that the affiliated companies have collected using cookies. The behavioural data retrieved from the behavioural database of a data subject to KDB is also collected from the websites of various companies. IMY considers that data subjects cannot be expected to have their behavioural data collected for marketing purposes 32See judgment Asociaţia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA, C-708/18, EU:C:2019:1064, paragraph 48 25 just because they visit a website. Nor can they be expected to have their behavioural data combined with data from another purchasing situation or data collected from other registers for the purpose of contacting them for telephone sales or direct mail marketing. This is not changed by the privacy-enhancing measure that the affiliated companies that carry out the marketing measure do not have access to the collected behavioral data, but only contact information. The EDPB guidelines state that the scope for using legitimate interest as a legal basis for profiling depends on how detailed the profile is, how extensive the profile is, the consequences of the profiling and the safeguards intended to ensure a fair, non-discriminatory and correct profiling process. IMY believes that the privacy interest of the data subjects is strong due to the nature of the data, since the data enables the mapping of individual behavior and the collection of the data is given special protection in the LEK. IMY further notes that this is profiling as referred to in Article 4(4) of the GDPR and that the profiling is extensive as it provides an in-depth picture of the data subject. It is also a matter of data collected from various websites combined with data obtained from customer engagement and statistical data from Bisnode Sverige AB. Against this background, IMY notes that the nature of the processing means that the privacy interests of the data subjects outweigh the interests of Bonnier News AB and its affiliated companies in the processing of personal data based on a so-called supplemented customer database profile and which is carried out for the purpose of making contact details available to affiliated companies for telephone sales and postal marketing. Against this background, IMY notes that Bonnier News AB has processed personal data without having a legal basis for it according to Article 6(1) of the GDPR by profiling the data subjects based on their supplemented customer database profiles for the purpose of making contact details available to affiliated companies for telephone sales and postal marketing. 3.6.7 Balancing of interests for personal data not linked to the behavioral database As IMY stated above in section 3.6.6, Bonnier News AB's interest is primarily a commercial interest that does not weigh particularly heavily. When assessing the interests of the data subjects for such processing that is not linked to the behavioral database, IMY considers the following. Bonnier News AB has taken measures to minimize the number of data points both in relation to the principles of data minimization and storage minimization by not sharing data at the item level, but only at the product category, brand and type of packaging. The profiling also does not include data collected through cookies. The investigation has further shown that the individual has had the opportunity to object before the processing and that Bonnier News AB respects the data subjects' wishes to avoid marketing that has been noted in national blocking lists or with the data controller. Against this background, IMY believes that the processing is within the scope of what individuals can reasonably expect based on the information provided and that data is only disclosed to affiliated companies within the group. 26 IMY believes that, on a balanced assessment, the interests or fundamental rights of the data subjects do not outweigh the interests of Bonnier News AB and the affiliated companies in the current processing. Against this background, IMY notes that Bonnier News AB has been supported for its processing in Article 6(1)(f) of the Data Protection Regulation. 3.7 Choice of intervention 3.7.1 Applicable provisions and other general starting points IMY has a number of corrective powers in the event of violations of the Data Protection Regulation, including reprimands, injunctions and penalty fees. This follows from Article 58(2)(a)–(j) of the Data Protection Regulation. The IMY shall impose administrative fines in addition to or in place of other corrective measures referred to in Article 58(2), depending on the circumstances of each case. Where a controller or a processor, in relation to the same or connected processing operations, intentionally or negligently infringes several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount set for the most serious infringement. This is stated in Article 83(3) of the GDPR. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines in each case is effective, proportionate and dissuasive. This is stated in Article 83(1) of the GDPR. Article 83(2) sets out the factors to be taken into account in determining whether an administrative fine should be imposed and in assessing the amount of the fine. The EDPB has adopted guidelines on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR, which aim to create a harmonised method and principles for calculating fines. 33 In the case of a minor infringement, the IMY may, in accordance with recital 148 of the GDPR, issue a reprimand in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) instead of imposing a fine. 3.7.2 Same or connected data processing operations The IMY has assessed in three cases above that Bonnier News AB lacked support in Article 6(1) of the GDPR for its processing of personal data. IMY assesses that these processing operations, which all take place in the company's databases through profiling for marketing purposes, are interconnected in the manner referred to in Article 83(3) of the Data Protection Regulation. 3.7.3 Penalty fee IMY has assessed that Bonnier News AB has violated Article 6(1) of the Data Protection Regulation in its processing of personal data for the purpose of displaying tailored advertisements and making contact details available to affiliated companies for telephone sales and direct postal marketing. IMY does not consider that these are minor infringements. 33EDPB Guidelines 8/2020 Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR (adopted for public consultation on 12 May 2022). 27 Bonnier News AB shall therefore be imposed an administrative penalty fee for these infringements. IMY notes that infringements of Article 6(1) of the GDPR are covered by Article 83(5) which means that a fine of up to EUR 20 million or four percent of the global annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, may be imposed. In determining the maximum amount of a fine to be imposed on an undertaking, the definition of the concept of undertaking used by the Court of Justice of the European Union in the application of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU (see recital 150 of the GDPR) shall be used. The Court's case law shows that this covers any entity that carries out economic activity, regardless of the legal form of the entity and the way in which it is financed, and even if the entity in legal terms consists of several natural or legal persons.34 IMY assesses that the turnover of the company that should be used as a basis for calculating the administrative penalty that can be imposed on Bonnier News AB is Bonnier News AB's parent company Albert Bonnier AB. From the information obtained, it appears that Albert Bonnier AB's annual turnover in 2021 was SEK 23,299,000,000. The maximum sanction amount that can be determined in the case is four percent of this amount, i.e. approximately SEK 931,960,000. IMY assesses that the following factors are relevant to the assessment of the seriousness of the infringement. This has been a matter of profiling of individuals for profit both when the profiling has been carried out to display tailored advertisements and when it has been carried out to disclose contact details for telephone sales and postal marketing. The profiling carried out to display tailored advertisements has, in cases where data in the behavioural database about individuals' surfing behaviour has been linked to the KDB, included surfing history, purchase history and demographic and statistical data. It has been a matter of a violation that has been ongoing for a long time and concerned a large number of data subjects and included a large amount of personal data. However, the data processed, as far as has been established, do not constitute special categories of personal data as specified in Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation. In this decision, IMY has assessed that the profiling through supplementary behavioural profiles was extensive in nature. Even for the profiling of personal data in KDB where there was a connection to data in the behavioral database, so-called supplemented customer database profiles, IMY has made the assessment that the profiling was extensive in nature, since it contained data collected about the individual's surfing behavior obtained from several websites combined with data from purchases made (customer engagement) and data obtained from Bisnode Sverige AB. However, IMY makes the assessment that the current personal data processing does not entail major consequences for the data subjects. It concerns an impact that is assessed to be moderate. In both of these cases, IMY considers that the profiling that took place where data could be linked together in the two databases, supplementary behavioral profiles and the supplementary customer database profiles, has a higher degree of seriousness compared to the 34See Judgment in Akzo Nobel, C-516/15, EU:C:2017:314, paragraph. 48 28 violation concerning the profiling that takes place in the so-called simple behavioral profiles to display customized advertisements. IMY believes that the profiling that takes place in the so-called simple behavioral profiles to display customized advertisements is in itself grounding for sanctions, but that it has a lower degree of seriousness than the violations where a connection could be made between the different databases. The reason for this is that it concerns less information about the data subjects and indirect personal data. IMY, however, considers that this violation also includes systematic processing that has been going on for a long time and has affected a large number of data subjects. The measures that Bonnier has taken to limit the infringement of the data subjects' personal integrity, in the form of set storage periods, that data is not recorded at the product level, that no more data than necessary is disclosed to affiliated companies, according to IMY, result in a significant reduction in the seriousness of the violations. The personal data has also not been disclosed outside the group. IMY has noted that Bonnier News AB has consistently taken measures to reduce the privacy breach for the data subjects in its group-wide cooperation. This situation is also taken into account when assessing the seriousness of the violations. In light of the above circumstances, IMY assesses that these are violations of low severity overall. The starting point for calculating the sanction fee should therefore be low in relation to the current maximum amount. In addition to assessing the seriousness of the violation, IMY shall assess whether there are any aggravating or mitigating circumstances that are significant for the amount of the sanction fee. IMY assesses that there are no further aggravating or mitigating circumstances, in addition to those taken into account when assessing the severity above, that affect the amount of the sanction fee. In light of the seriousness of the violation, aggravating and mitigating circumstances and the high turnover in relation to the violations found , IMY sets the administrative sanction fee for Bonnier News AB at 13,000,000 SEK. IMY assesses that this amount is effective, proportionate and dissuasive. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This decision has been made by Director General Lena Lindgren Schelin after a presentation by lawyer Ulrika Bergström.

Page 1 of 5Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten Record number: DI-2020-10518 2 (5) Date: 2021-03-31 With regard to the first complaint, the company states that the complainant's request for access was received by the company via e-mail on 5, 10 and 29 January 2019. Since the request was received by an e-mail address other than the one the company refers to for data protection issues The request was not processed in accordance with the company's internal processing routines. The caused a longer processing time and that information as well as a copy of the complainant's personal data pursuant to Article 15 was not sent until 18 June 2019.

The company requested a new address on January 7, 2020 and has not received a response. The processing has taken place through correspondence. Given that there are two cross-border complaints, the IMY has used the mechanisms of cooperation and uniformity contained in Chapter VII of the Data Protection Regulation. Affected regulators have been the data protection authorities of Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, Denmark and Norway. Justification of decision Applicable regulations The person responsible for personal data is obliged to provide information to anyone who requests it information on personal data concerning the applicant is processed or not. treated such data, the controller shall, in accordance with Article 15 i the Data Protection Regulation, provide the applicant with additional information and a a copy of the personal data processed by the data controller.

Page 2 of 5Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten Record number: DI-2020-10518 3 (5) Date: 2021-03-31 IMY's assessment Has there been a breach of the Data Protection Regulation? Complaint 1 (Annex 1 from Austria with national reference number: D130.247) With regard to the first complaint, the IMY notes that the complainant, in accordance with Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation, provided with information and a copy of the personal data processed. However, the right of access was only satisfied after more than five months from the submission of the first request. The request thus does not have handled without undue delay and within the stipulated time limit in Article 12 (3) and the complainant has also not been informed of the delay. What the company has stated that they handle a large number of inquiry matters according to the Data Protection Regulation and that prompt questions are answered promptly does not cause anyone another assessment regarding the delay and that it was thus a question of one infringement of Article 12 (3) concerning complaints 1. Complaint 2 (Annex 2 from Germany with national reference number: LDA-1085.1- 13373/19-F) With regard to the second complaint, the IMY notes that the complainant, in accordance with Article 15, provided with information and a copy of the personal data provided treated. The information was provided without undue delay. After the complainant pointed out that he had not received the mailing, the company requested alternative contact information. Against this background, IMY considers that the company has not been obliged to take any further action in response to that request. Choice of intervention Article 58 (2) (i) and Article 83 (2) state that the IMY has the power to impose administrative penalty fees in accordance with Article 83. the circumstances of the individual case, administrative penalty fees shall be imposed in addition to or in place of the other measures referred to in Article 58 (2), such as: injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83 (2) sets out the factors to be taken into account taken into account when deciding whether to impose administrative penalty fees and at determining the amount of the fee. In the case of a minor infringement, IMY as stated in recital 148 instead of imposing a penalty fee issue one reprimand under Article 58 (2) (b). Account shall be taken of aggravating and mitigating circumstances circumstances of the case, such as the nature, severity and duration of the infringement as well as previous violations of relevance. In an overall assessment of the circumstances, the IMY finds that, with regard to complaints 1, is a minor infringement within the meaning of recital 148 and that Klarna Bank AB must therefore be reprimanded in accordance with Article 58 (2) (b) for the person found the infringement. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This decision has been made by Catharina Fernquist, Head of Unit, after a presentation by jurist Murat Vrana.

The case is closed without action. Report on the supervisory matter The Privacy Protection Authority (IMY) has initiated supervision regarding MAG Interactive AB (the company) in connection with a complaint. The complaint has been submitted to IMY, i as the supervisory authority responsible for the company's activities in accordance with Article 56 the Data Protection Regulation, from the supervisory authority of the country where the complainant has left lodged its complaint in accordance with the provisions of the Regulation on cooperation in cross-border cases. The complaint alleges that the company has not handled the complainant's request deletion of the complainant's personal data in accordance with Article 17 of the Data Protection Regulation. MAG Interactive AB has mainly stated the following. The company first received a request on deletion of the complainant's account on the company's services on 29 November 2018 (on first request). Because the request came from a different email address than the one that linked to the account, the company requested that the complainant return with evidence to proof of his identity, which the complainant did not do. On May 29, 2019, a new one was added request for deletion of the complainant's account, but then by post and with the required evidence to prove the identity of the complainant (the second request). The company deleted Postal address: the complainant's information manually on 15 June 2019 in accordance with the request, except those Box 8114 information needed to show that the request has been processed. Due to oversight 104 20 Stockholm, however, the complainant was not informed of the outcome of the request in connection with that Website: www.imy.se E-mail: imy@imy.se REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of Telephone: natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and on 08-657 61 00 Repeal of Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Regulation). Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2020-10538 2 (3) Date: 2021-01-22 request was processed. Instead, it took place only in connection with a review before answers in this supervisory matter, ie on 6 November 2020. The processing has taken place through correspondence. Given that it applies to one cross-border complaints, the IMY has used the mechanisms of cooperation and uniformity contained in Chapter VII of the Data Protection Regulation. Affected regulators have been the data protection authorities in Norway, Ireland, France, Austria, Denmark, Poland and Germany. Justification of decision Applicable regulations According to Article 12 (3) of the Data Protection Regulation, the controller shall: request without undue delay and in any case no later than one month after to have received the request to provide the data subject with information on the measures taken taken in accordance with Article 17. This period may, if necessary, be extended by a further two months, taking into account the complexity of the request and the number received requests. The personal data controller shall notify the data subject of a such extension within one month of receipt of the request and state the reasons to the delay. According to Article 12 (6), the controller may, if he has reasonable grounds for: question the identity of the natural person submitting a request under Article 17; request additional information necessary to confirm the data subject's identity is provided. According to Article 17 (1) (a), the data subject shall have the right to be informed by the controller without undue delay have their personal data deleted and it the person responsible for personal data shall be obliged to delete without undue delay personal data if the personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which which they have collected or otherwise treated. According to Article 17 (3) (b), this shall not be the case apply to the extent that the processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation requiring treatment under Union law. Pursuant to Article 57 (1) (f), each supervisory authority in its territory shall be responsible for: process complaints from a data subject and, where appropriate, investigate the matter to which the complaint relates. The Integrity Protection Authority's assessment Regarding the first request, IMY states that MAG Interactive AB was reasonable reasons to doubt the identity of the appellant and thus justifiable to request that the appellant provided additional evidence, which the appellant did not do. IMY considers against this background that the company has not been obliged to take any further measures due to that request. With regard to the second request, IMY notes that the company deleted the complainant's information, in addition to the information required to demonstrate that the request has been processed, within 16 days from the company receiving the request on May 29, 2019. IMY believes that the company has deleted the complainant's information without undue delay within the meaning of Article 17 Data Protection Regulation. Furthermore, the company has been justified in retaining the information. The Privacy Protection Agency Record number: DI-2020-10538 3 (3) Date: 2021-01-22 needed to demonstrate that the request has been processed in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. However, the company first informed the complainant of the outcome of the second request 6 November 2020. Since the data controller pursuant to Article 12 (3) without unnecessary delay and in any case no later than one month after receipt request, with no exception here, shall inform the data subject of the measures taken pursuant to Article 17, MAG Interactive AB has violated Article 12 (3) the Data Protection Regulation. The company has stated that the reason why the complainant was not informed of the result of the request was due to an oversight. According to the company, this was mainly caused by that the request was handled manually because it was received by mail and that the company normally handles requests in a system where notifications of actions taken are sent automatically. Due to what happened, the company has stated that it will see over their routines so that what happened is not repeated. The company will, among other things, put set up a separate log for manual cases to ensure that all steps are followed, including that the user is notified in the manner he has requested. IMY states that it is of course important that the person responsible for personal data notifies the data subject on what measures have been taken in connection with his request, even in cases where the request is fully complied with to the extent that may be required. In light of the circumstances regarding the infringement that the company has highlighted - and the measures that the company has stated that it has taken and will take - considers however, IMY that the substance of the complaint has been investigated to the extent appropriate Article 57 (1) (f) of the Data Protection Regulation. Against this background, the case is closed without action. This decision has been made by Catharina Fernquist, Head of Unit, after a presentation by lawyer Olle Pettersson.

The complaint essentially states the following. The complainant registered as a customer and user of the company’s service on 5 November 2019 and declined to receive e-mails from the company on the same day through their user account. Nevertheless, the complainant received e-mails from the company on 12, 15, 19 and 23 November 2019. The complainant also received an e-mail on 6 November 2019 but states in the complaint that they can allow that mailing to pass. The complainant also states in the complaint that the date of the infringement is 12 November 2019. It was not until the complainant contacted the company's customer service on 28 November 2019 that the mailings stopped. What Readly AB has stated The company essentially states the following. On 28 November 2019, the complainant contacted the company's customer service and, on the same day, the company took steps to make sure the complainant would not receive further e-mails. The company’s customer service confirmed by e-mail to the complainant on 29 November 2019 that the complainant's e-mail address was unsubscribed from all future e-mails. On 2 December 2019, the complainant requested an explanation of why they had received e-mails even though they had unsubscribed. On 3 December 2019, the company informed the complainant that it was a mistake caused by human error, which the company took measures on, on 28 November 2019. The company states that they make a distinction between mailings that have the contract as a lawful basis, from mailings for marketing purposes, which are based on legitimate interest. The e-mails received by the complainant were intended to communicate with the user about the service and have the customer contract as a lawful basis. The e-mails are part of the company’s welcome routine for newly registered users. The purpose of the e-mails is to explain to the user how the service works and what functionality the service contains. The company argues that the e- mails received by the complainant are necessary in order to, and in accordance with the contract, provide the user with individually tailored content, e.g. to recommend newspapers and magazines that the user is likely to be interested in, based on the user’s reading history. According to the company, users normally expect the service to adapt the content based on the customer’s use of the service. Since the e-mails have been part of the service, the processing of personal data as a result of the mailings has been necessary and thus had the contract as a lawful basis. The company offers users to unsubscribe from these e-mails, which is offered as a part of the service. Readly, therefore, takes the view that the complainant's personal data was not processed for marketing purposes. If the mailings were to be regarded as marketing and the processing of personal data cannot be based on a contract as a lawful basis, the company believes that the processing of personal data instead has the purpose of communicating with the user for marketing purposes and relies on the company’s legitimate interests.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: Di-2021-10547 3(7) Date:2022-04-01 Justification of the decision Applicable provisions, etc. In order for personal data processing to be considered lawful, at least one of the conditions set out in Article 6(1) GDPR must be fulfilled. This means either that the data subject has given consent to the processing referred to in point (a) which fulfils the conditions set out in Article 4(11) and Article 7 or that the processing is necessary in one of the contexts listed in points (b) to (f), for example, for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or to take action at the request of the data subject prior to the conclusion of such a contract (point (b)) or for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject overrun and require the protection of personal data (point (f)). There may be several applicable legal bases for the same treatment. 2 Under Article 21(1), an individual shall have the right, on grounds relating to his or her specific situation, to object aany time to the processing of personal data relating to him or her based on Article 6(1)(e) (data carried out in the public interest or the exercise of official authority) or (f) (legitimate interest), including profiling based on those provisions. The controller may no longer process the personal data unless it can demonstrate compelling legitimate reasons for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the individual or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. Under Article 21(2), individuals have the right at all times to object to their personal data being used for direct marketing purposes. If an objection is made to direct marketing, the personal data may no longer be processed for such purposes, as follows from Article 21(3). Article 12(3) requires requests under Article 21 to be dealt with without undue delay and in any event within one month at the latest. This period may, if necessary, be extended by a further two months, taking into account the complexity of a request and the number of requests received. Assessment of the Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) Starting points on contract as a lawful basis under Article 6(1) General Data Protection Regulation Where a contract is to provide a lawful basis for the processing of personal data, the processing of personal data must be necessary either for the performance of the contract with the data subject or for taking steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. When assessing whether the processing is necessary, account shall be taken to the nature of the service, the expectations of the average user in relation to the contractual terms and conditions and how the service is marketed, and whether the service can be provided without that specific processing. However, just the mere fact that a processing of personal data is mentioned in a contract does not automatically mean that the processing is necessary for the performance of the contract. The processing must be objectively necessary for the performance of the specific contract. It is not enough that the processing is “useable”. A controller should be able to demonstrate 2Judgement of 9 March 2017, Manni398/15, EU:C:2017:197, paragraph 42.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: Di-2021-10547 4(7) Date:2022-04-01 that the main purpose of the specific contract cannot in practice be achieved if the processing in question is not carried out. 3 As a general rule, the processing of personal data for the purpose of providing behavioural advertising is not necessary for the performance of an online service contract. If a user has paid a service provider to have certain goods or/and services delivered without the intention of having their preferences and lifestyle profiled through click history on a website, it is difficult to claim that the contract could not have been 4 performed without the behavioural advertising. Has the company infringed Article 12.3 and 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation? In the present case, in the light of the complaint, IMY has to assess whether canceling the e-mail subscription 23 days after the complainant’s request, made by declining through their account on 5 November 2019, was in accordance with the GDPR. The first question for IMY to examine is whether the complainant had a right to object to that specific type of mailing and which lawful basis the processing is based on. The company claims, first, that the processing is based on the contract with the complainant and, in the alternative, on its legitimate interests. Readly AB provides a subscription service for the digital distribution of newspapers and magazines in an app. Therefore, the specific service purchased by a user by entering into a contract with the company is the ability to read newspapers and magazines digitally, which IMY finds to be the main purpose of the contract. A review of Readly’s website (landing page) shows that their service is mainly marketed as following: • a digital subscription service without a binding time, • the possibility to use offline mode, • access to the latest and previous editions; • unlimited reading at a low cost and • the possibility of family sharing. On the basis of the contract, the company processes its customers’ personal data in order to provide the service and for payment purposes. In order for the company to be able to process the personal data for other purposes with the contract as a lawful basis, the company needs to be able to demonstrate that the processing is necessary for the performance of the contract with the data subject. In the present case, the company has sent an e-mail to the complainant with the purpose of communicating about the service, which the company believes can rely on the contract as a lawful basis. However, it should be noted that several of the e-mails have contained information on how the complainant can further optimize the service according to the complainant's personal interests and receive personalized recommendations based on their reading history. At least one of the e-mails contained individually tailored suggestions that stated ""Find your favorite magazines and discover similar titles. Start with these ones we’ve highlighted just for you"". 3European Data Protection Board’s Guidelines 2/2019 on the processing of personal data under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of the provision of online services to data subjects, para. 57. 4Article 29 Data Protection Working Party - Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679 p. 13-14 and 5Accessed from the company’s website, https://.com/gb-21 (visited 2021-10-20); Translated by IMYPrivacy Protection Authority Our ref: Di-2021-10547 5(7) Date:2022-04-01 The company states on its website that they offer suggestions for recommended reading when purchasing an online subscription. Although the company informs that they offer personalized content, it cannot be assumed that an average user understands or perceives this to be a necessarily part of the service. The fact that the company also offers the opportunity to unsubscribe from such e-mails suggests that the processing of personal data was not necessary for the performance of the contract. According to IMY, the e-mails received by the complainant with individually tailored content are not objectively necessary to fulfill the main purpose of the contract, i.e. providing a digital newspaper and magazine subscription. IMY finds that these e-mails cannot be supported on article 6(1)(b) GDPR. IMY considers that the e-mails are primarily intended to improve the access to and experience of the service and that the individually adapted content constitutes direct marketing . The complainant therefore had the right to object to the processing of their personal data under Article 21(2) and, after receiving such an objection, the company was obliged to stop sending e-mails for direct marketing purposes. After the complainant unsubscribed they still received marketing e-mails for another 23 days, which according to the company was due to an oversight and human error on their part. IMI finds that the company has not, in this case, acted without undue delay and therefore violated Article 21(3) and 12(3) of the GDPR. The company's statement, that if the processing of personal data cannot be based on a contract as a lawful basis, it may instead support the processing on legitimate interest, does not affect IMY:s assessment of the violation of Article 21(3) and 12(3). Has the company infringed Article 6.1 of the General Data Protection Regulation? In the present case, in the light of the complaint, IMY has to assess whether the processing complained of by the complainant has been carried out in accordance with the GDPR. It is clear from the complaint that it does not cover the mailing on 6 November. IMY’s assessment is therefore focused on whether the company has had a lawful basis for the e-mails sent between 12 and 23 November 2019. When a data subject objects to direct marketing, further processing of his or her personal data is no longer permitted for such purposes. That means that there is then no lawful basis for the processing. In order to determine when the company has ceased to have a lawful basis for the processing, it must be assessed when the objection should in any event have been dealt with. Where a data subject objects to direct marketing pursuant to Article 21(2), the controller shall cease mailings for direct marketing purposes. Since that right is unconditional, there is no need for individual examination of such an objection. The 6 The GDPR does not define the terms ‘marketing’ or ‘direct marketing’. However, recital 47 mentions direct marke ing as an example of what may be a legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f). In the Swedish Marke ing Act (2008:486) marketing is defined as: ""advertising and other measures in the course of business activities which are intended to promote the sale of and access to products including a trader’s actions, omissions or other measures or behaviour before, during or after sale or delivery of products to consumers or traders."" The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Advertising and marketing communication code (ICC Code), 2018 edition, Chapter C, define the term “direct marketing” as "" communication, by whatever means, of advertising or marketing material carried out by a direct marketer itself or on its behalf, and which is directed to particular individuals using their personal contact information (including mailing address, telephone number, email address, mobile phone number, facsimile, personal social media account handle, and the like."" Available here; icc-advertising- and-marketing-communications-code-int.pdf (iccwbo.org)Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: Di-2021-10547 6(7) Date:2022-04-01 objection should therefore be dealt with promptly and routinely. The company also has an automated system that aims to easily capture the data subject’s intention, i.e. to object to direct marketing. The complainant's intention to object to direct marketing was therefore not unclear to the company. This suggests that the time limit within which the objection should have been dealt with in this case is short. According to Article 12(3) a request under Articles 15 to 22 shall be dealt with without undue delay. The complainant objected on 5 November 2019 pursuant to Article 21 and thereafter received marketing e-mails on 12, 15, 19 and 23 November 2019. Between 5 and 12 November six days passed. In view of the foregoing, IMY considers that the company should have handled the complainant’s objection at least after six days. It therefore did not handle the objection without undue delay and, consequently, had no lawful basis for processing the complainant’s personal data for direct marketing purposes. The direct marketing mailings on 12, 15, 19 and 23 November 2019 meant that the company processed the complainant’s personal data in violation of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. Choice of corrective measure Pursuant to Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83(2) IMY has the authority to impose administrative fines in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, administrative fines may be imposed in addition to or instead of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2). Furthermore, Article 83(2) states which factors should be taken into account in decisions on whether administrative fines should be imposed and when determining the amount of the fine. In case of a minor infringement, IMY may, as stated in Recital 148, instead of imposing a sanction fee, issue a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b). In this assessment, regard shall be taken to aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the case, such as the nature of the infringement, severity and duration as well as previous infringement of relevance. IMY notes that the time passed before the company acted was relatively short. The data in question was not special category data nor other types of particularly integrity- sensitive data. The infringement was negligent, and when the company understood the complainant's intentions actions were taken. Against this background IMY considers that it is a matter of a minor infringement within the meaning of recital 148 and that Readly AB should be given a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR for the stated infringement.

The appellants have requested that their personal data must be deleted. The company has replied that one request can only be handled if the individual submits information about date of birth, address, customer number, information about recent purchases such as order number and information about payment method including the last four digits of the credit card number when paying by card. Several of them complainants believe that their purchases are so far back in time that they could not retrieve all the requested data. The appellants dispute that all of the the requested data is necessary to confirm their identity and manage their requests. What the complainant and CDON have stated in their respective complaints Complaint 1 (Finland with national diary number 2529/182/2018) On 28 May 2018, the appellant submitted a request for the deletion of his personal data. The company has replied that a request can only be handled if it is the complainant comes in with date of birth, address, customer number, order number and depending on the payment method for the latest order, the following information: • on invoice: price and reference number • for card payment: the last four digits of the credit card number • for direct payment: reference number and receipt In summary, the appellant states that she cannot remember or find them the information requested by the company because the order was made 5–10 years ago. Complaint 2 (Finland with national diary number 2537/154/2018) On 25 May 2018, the appellant submitted a request for the deletion of his customer data. The company has replied that it requires information about the date of birth, customer number, order number and payment method for the most recent order. The appellant believes that it is unreasonable to have to answer these questions in order to be able to protect their rights. The complainant does not have the information requested by the company and has used the erasure request email that was associated with the complainant customer account. Complaint 3 (Finland with national diary number 2648/182/2018) On 31 May 2018, the complainant contacted the Finnish data protection authority after have requested access to and deletion of their data from the company.

Furthermore, it is stated that the company does not seem to delete the data without getting answers to their detailed questions at one request for deletion. Page 2 of 11The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-10549 3(11) Date: 2023-03-31 Complaint 4 (Finland with national diary number 2664/182/2018) On 31 May 2018, the complainant turned to the Finnish data protection authority after to have requested deletion from the company. It had been 5-10 years since the appellant ordered anything from the company. In order to have their data deleted, the complainant needs to provide data from their purchase which was carried out several years ago. The appellant also needs provide personal data that was not previously needed to complete a purchase. The company has in its response to the appellant informed that there is a right to access and that delete personal data but that the company has the right to retain certain personal data for accounting purposes. In order to meet a request, the company needs for security reasons get information about the complainant's date of birth, address, customer number, order number from last order and depending on the payment method of the last order following task: • on invoice: price and reference number • for card payment: the last four digits of the credit card number • for direct payment: reference number and receipt The company has stated that they cannot verify the date the complaint was received by the company or the date on which the company requested additional information from the complainant. Because the appellant has not been an active customer of CDON in the last two to five years CDON also confirms that the complainants' personal data has been deleted from CDON's system and that no information about the appellant remains. Complaint 5 (Finland with national diary number 2478/153/2018) The complainant has contacted the Finnish Data Protection Authority after requesting deletion of their data at the company. The company has informed the complainant that it there is a right to access and to delete personal data but that the company has the right to retain certain personal data for accounting purposes. To accommodate a request does the company need information about the complainant's date of birth, address, customer number, order number from the last order and depending on payment method for the last order following information: • on invoice: price and reference number • for card payment: the last four digits of the credit card number • for direct payment: reference number and receipt The appellant does not remember when an order was made from the company and how the purchase was made was paid. It has been over a year since anything was ordered. The company has stated that they cannot verify the date the complaint was received by the company or the date on which the company requested additional information from the complainant. Because the appellant has not been an active customer of CDON in the last two to five years CDON also confirms that the complainants' personal data has been deleted from CDON's system and that no information about the appellant remains. Complaint 6 (Finland with national diary number 2814/154/2018) The complainant has filed a complaint with the Finnish Data Protection Authority after a request for erasure with the company on 21 May 2018. The complainant states that the company makes it difficult to exercise the right to erasure by requesting information as a man should not have to save as a customer. The process contributes to the fact that it takes a long time to get personal data deleted. In its response to the complainant on 29 May 2018, the company demanded information about date of birth, address, customer number and one of the following: Page 3 of 11The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-10549 4(11) Date: 2023-03-31 • order number from the last order, • depending on the payment method for the most recent order, the following information: o on invoice: price and reference number o for card payment: the last four digits of the credit card number o for direct payment: reference number and receipt Complaint 7 (Denmark with national diary number 2018-31-0638) The complainant states that he tried to delete his customer account online at cdon.dk by use a hyperlink http://cdon.dk/. The company responded to the complainant on 29 May 2018 and requested information about date of birth, address, customer number, order number from last order and payment method for the last order including those last four digits of the credit card number. The appellant states i.a. that the company requires more data when exercising the right to deletion than when creating the customer account. The complainant has used the same email address when requesting deletion as at the creation of the customer account with the company. What CDON AB has stated otherwise CDON AB has essentially stated the following. The complaints Of the complaints received, CDON has been able to identify six out of seven complainants against information in their systems. As regards these six complainants, CDON notes that they are personal data controller for the processing of personal data to which the complaints refer. Regarding the seventh complaint (2478/153/2018), the company has stated that the complainant could not be identified but that it is possible that the complainant has had a customer relationship with CDON under an email address other than the one provided therein complaints sent to the supervisory authority. In connection with the appellants requesting deletion, they have submitted to CDON name and email address. However, CDON has assessed that only these two data are not sufficient to ensure the identity of the complainants. CDON has, with the support of Article 12.6 in the data protection regulation, therefore requested supplementary information from all complaining. In addition to name and email address, CDON has requested the following information in order to ensure the identity of the complainants: • date of birth, • civil registration address, • customer number, • order number for last order, and • payment method for last order. In addition, the complainants have had to provide the following information about payment methods: • for invoice purchases: price and reference number, • in case of card payment: the last four digits of the card, • in the case of direct payment: reference or invoice number. Existing routines In this context, CDON takes the complaints received very seriously difficulties for data subjects to exercise their rights under the data protection regulation and has continuously worked to improve its procedures for identification upon request register extract or deletion. Since 2018, when the complaints were received, the identification process has been reviewed and clarified. Over the years, CDON has worked to improve handling and ensure a simple and secure process at Page 4 of 11The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-10549 5(11) Date: 2023-03-31 requests for erasure. Customers who wish to request deletion or access are referred to to contact the company at kunddata@cdon.com. In connection with a registered contacts the company with a request for deletion, the company informs the registered person that the registrant's email will shortly be unregistered from CDON's newsletter (if such subscription is activated). To have their account deleted, request i the current situation CDON that the customer answers two security questions (one each from category 1 and 2) in order for CDON to be able to ensure that the person making contact is correct registered. Those registered may choose to answer a question from each security category of questions that CDON provides. This means that they registrants need to answer only one of the following security questions in category 1. According the control questions in category 1, customers must state date of birth, civil registration address or customer number at CDON.com. After that, the registrants only need to answer one of the following security questions in category 2. The control questions in category 2 are linked to latest order where the customer either states the order number or depending on the payment method enter one of the following information: on invoice; sum and OCR number, at card payment: the last four digits of the card and in case of direct payment; transaction id or invoice ID. In case a customer is unwilling or unable to answer the security questions requested the data subject is also offered the opportunity to contact customer service for follow-up and investigation of alternative security issues to try to find another way to verify the customer's identity. CDON believes that at least two more are necessary information in addition to name and e-mail address from customers according to the company's new routine for to be able to verify with sufficient certainty that it is the right person making one request. CDON's routine for identification and verification of the data subject does not mean that new information is collected about the data subject. CDON only requests to receive two different ones data verified against the data CDON already processes about it registered with a legal basis to be able to verify the identity of the registered. The company's thinning routines CDON has explained that they have a routine for thinning emails and another routine for thinning of personal data. CDON's routine for thinning emails means that all emails received in CDON's customer data box, i.e. kunddata@cdon.com, where customers become referred if they have requests for deletion or register extracts, are thinned and deleted after 14 months from the date the emails were received by CDON. Thinning of customer profiles on CDON is currently based on consumer law obligations in different countries for example after three years in Sweden. CDON thus confirms that all were complained about personal data deleted at CDON. Justification of decisions Applicable regulations In order for personal data processing to be compatible with the data protection regulation, it is required among other things, that the processing meets the requirements regarding the principles of processing of 3 personal data specified in Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation, including the principle on data minimization (Article 5.1 c) and the principle of responsibility (Article 5.2). 2Since 22 January 2021, CDON only collects birth numbers (if the registered person chooses to supplement with that information in security question 1) and not the full social security number (dnr DI-2020-10549-18 p.2). 3 See the judgment of the European Court of Justice, Valsts eizumenu dienests, C-175/20, EU:C:2022:124, paragraph 50, with case law. Page 5 of 11The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-10549 6(11) Date: 2023-03-31 According to Article 5.1 c of the data protection regulation, the personal data must be adequate, relevant and not too extensive in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (principle of task minimization). In accordance with the principle of responsibility stipulated in Article 5.2 of the Data Protection Regulation the personal data controller must be able to demonstrate that paragraph 1 of this article is complied with, i.e. has the burden of proof for this. 4 According to article 11.2 of the data protection regulation, if the person in charge of personal data, in the cases referred to in paragraph 1 of this article, can show that he is not in a position to identify the data subject, the personal data controller shall, if possible, inform it registered about this. In such cases, Articles 15–20 shall not apply, except when the registered for the exercise of their rights in accordance with these articles provides additional information that makes identification possible. According to article 12.2 of the data protection regulation, the personal data controller must facilitate the exercise of the data subject's rights in accordance with Articles 15-22. IN the cases referred to in Article 11.2 of the Data Protection Regulation receive it personal data controller does not refuse to comply with the data subject's request to exercise their rights under Articles 15-22, unless the data controller shows that he or she is unable to identify the data subject. Article 12.6 of the data protection regulation states that without prejudice to the application of article 11 of the data protection regulation, the personal data controller gets, if he has reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of the natural person submitting a request according to articles 15-21, request additional information necessary to confirm the data subject's identity is provided. In the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) guidelines 01/2022 on the right of access states the following. If the personal data controller has reasonable grounds to doubt the requester the person's identity, he may, as stated above, request additional information for to confirm the identity of the data subject. However, the personal data controller must at the same time ensure that it does not collect more personal data than is necessary to enable identification of the requesting person. Therefore it should personal data controller make a proportionality assessment, which must take consideration of the type of personal data being processed (e.g. special categories of information or not), the nature of the request, the context in which the request is made as well as any damage that may occur as a result of improper disclosure. At assessment of proportionality, excessive data collection should be avoided while ensuring an appropriate level of security during treatment. 6 The data controller should implement an authentication procedure (control of the identity of the data subject) to be certain of the identity of the persons who request access to their data, and ensure the security of processing one 4 See the judgment of the European Court of Justice Valsts eizumenu dienests, C-175/20, EU:C:2022:124, paragraphs 77 and 81. 5Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access Version 2.0 Adopted on 28 March 2023 (EDPB's Guidelines 01/2022 on the right of access). 6 EDPB Guidelines 01/2022, paragraph 70, IMY's translation; original: ""As indicated above, if the controller has reasonable grounds for doubting the identity of the requesting person, it may request additional information to confirm the data subject's identity. However, the controller must at the same time ensure that it does not collect more personnel data than is necessary to enable authentication of the requesting person. Therefore, the controller shall carry out a proportionality assessment, which must take into account the type of personal data being processed (e.g. special categories of data or not), the nature of the request, the context within which the request is being made, as well as any damage that could result from improper disclosure. When assessing proportionality, it should be remembered to avoid excessive data collection while ensuring an adequate level of processing security.“ Page 6 of 11The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-10549 7(11) Date: 2023-03-31 request for access in accordance with Article 32, for example a secure channel for those registered to provide additional information. The method used for authentication should be relevant, appropriate, proportionate and respect the principle about task minimization. If the personal data controller introduces measures aimed at to identify the data subject that is burdensome it must in an appropriate way justify this and ensure compliance with all fundamental principles, including data minimization and the obligation to facilitate the exercise of those data subject's rights (Article 12.2 of the Data Protection Ordinance). 7 The Swedish Privacy Authority's assessment The complaints According to article 57.1 f of the data protection regulation, IMY must process complaints and where this is the case appropriately investigate the matter to which the complaint relates. The case includes seven complaints. IMY has requested that CDON comment on what information the company has requested, the necessity of each individual data, date of when the request for erasure was received i respective complaint, date of when the company requested supplementary information in order to confirm the identity in each complaint and whether the complainants contacted the company after May 25, 2018. Of complaints 4 (Finland with national diary number 2664/182/2018) and 5 (Finland with national diary number 2478/153/2018) no date appears for when the appellants made a request for deletion with the company or when the company requested it the supplementary information. The company has stated that they have deleted the complainant's personal data in the two individual complaints in accordance with its routine and cannot verify the date of when the request in the respective complaint was received or handled. IMY finds no reason to doubt that CDON has lacked the opportunity to find any information about the complainants and their requests for erasure. It has been several years since the complaints were submitted to the Finnish Data Protection Authority. IMY states that it is not possible to draw any safe conclusions from what has occurred in the case of the two complainants based on what has been possible to investigate in the complaints. The has, among other things, especially in light of the fact that the appellants' requests are attributable to the time in close connection with the data protection regulation starting to apply, has not been possible to investigate whether these two complaints are covered by the data protection regulation. CDON has further confirmed that no personal data on these two appellants anymore processed by the company. Against this background, IMY finds that the substantive issue in the two the complaints are investigated to the extent that is appropriate according to Article 57.1 f i data protection regulation. IMY therefore finds no reason to investigate these two complaints further. IMY has consequently based on the remaining five current complaints in the case partly examined the company's actions in these individual cases, partly about the company's current routine is compatible with the data protection regulation. 7EDPB's Guidelines 01/2022, point 71, IMY's translation, original; “The controller should implement an authentication procedure in order to be certain of the identity of the persons requesting access to their data, and ensure security of the processing throughout the process of handling an access request in accordance with Art. 32 GDPR, including for instance a secure channel for the data subjects to provide additional information. The method used for authentication should be relevant, appropriate, proportionate and respect the data minimization principle. If the controller imposes measures aimed at authenticating the data subject which are burdensome, it needs to adequately justify this and ensure compliance with all fundamental principles, including data minimization and the obligation to facilitate the exercise of data subjects' rights (Art. 12(2) GDPR). Page 7 of 11 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-10549 8(11) Date: 2023-03-31 General starting points It can be stated that the personal data controller, in order to identify a registered person, may request additional information that is necessary, about the personal data controller have reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of the person making the request. The Data Protection Regulation does not explicitly regulate which data may be requested or how the additional information is to be collected. The personal data controller must make a proportionality assessment to determine what is appropriate with respect to the regulation's requirements regarding security, among other things, but also in light of the requirement in Article 12.2 of the Data Protection Regulation, according to which it personal data controller shall facilitate the exercise of the data subject's rights. To casually require information for identification without regard to whether the information is necessary as described in article 12.6 of the data protection regulation contravenes according to IMY against both this provision and also against the principle of data minimization i Article 5.1 c of the data protection regulation. As follows from the wording of these regulations and as confirmed by the EDPB's guideline 01/2022 on the right of access, the personal data controller must implement a proportionality assessment and be able to justify the verification method used. To avoid excessive data collection, a request for additional information be proportionate in relation to the type of data being processed and 8 the damage that may occur. This is also confirmed by the guidelines. Has there been a breach of the data protection regulation regarding what presented in the complaints in this case? The question is about the information that the company required to meet the requests in them the individual cases where the data protection regulation is applicable (i.e. complaints 1-3 and 6-7) have been necessary to identify the respective appellants and thus in accordance with data protection regulation. The information that the company has requested in the individual complaints, in addition to name and e-mail, has been date of birth, civil registration address, customer number, order number and payment method for the last order, as well as, depending on the payment method, price and reference number when paying invoices, the last four digits of the card when paying by card, reference or invoice number for direct payment. The company has been given the opportunity to justify the manner in which the respective information was requested been necessary to identify the appellants in the individual cases. The company has without explain in more detail the necessity of the respective requested information, replied that it had not been enough name and email to identify the complainants and verify that it is the right person making a request. According to IMY, the company's statement does not sufficient support to establish that all of the other current information has been necessary to identify the data subjects in accordance with Article 12.6 i the data protection regulation and the principle of data minimization in Article 5.1 c i data protection regulation. It is CDON, in the capacity of personal data controller, who must be able to demonstrate that the processing is carried out in accordance with the regulation (Article 5.2 i data protection regulation). IMY believes that CDON has not done this. IMY states thus that CDON AB processed personal data in violation of article 5.1 c and 12.6 i data protection regulation. In this case, the complainants have had to come in with relatively many personal data in order to be able to exercise their right to deletion, i.a. order number and price for latest order and reference number for invoice purchases together with additional 8EDPB's Guidelines 01/2022, General considerations on the assessment of the data subject's request, pages 2-3. Page 8 of 11The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-10549 9(11) Date: 2023-03-31 tasks. In any case, it had been a long time since the appellant had shopped at CDON. This has meant that the appellants have not been able to exercise their right to erasure according to Article 17 of the data protection regulation without having to make an effort to look for in some cases old information and in any case a lot of information. By using without justification opts out of such a burdensome verification method when requesting deletion, the company has thus not facilitating the exercise of the data subjects' rights in the manner required according to article 12.2 of the data protection regulation. CDON AB has thus processed personal data in violation of Article 12.2 of the data protection regulation. Is the company's current routine compatible with the data protection regulation? The investigation shows that the company has continuously reviewed its routines for the handling of requests for deletion since 2018, when all current complaints i the case was received. The general routines that have been reviewed are those that have been in force since 22 January 2021 up to and including the date of IMY's decision in the current case. To ensure the identity of the data subject requesting deletion, it needs registrants now answer two questions (one question in category 1 and one question in category 2) such as date of birth and order number. In category 1, registrants need since January 22, 2021 do not state the social security number but only the date of birth about it registrants choose to supplement with that information. It is not new personal data which is requested to confirm the identity of the data subject without two different data in order to compare them against data that the company already processes about the data subject in order to verify the registrant. That CDON verifies the identity of the data subject before deletion of personal data takes place is also a protection for the data subject who should not have to have their personal data deleted by mistake. The company also offers a alternative route for the data subject who cannot or does not want to answer the security questions namely to contact customer service to find another way to verify it data subject's identity. For a customer who has not placed an order there is thus the option to contact customer service instead. Against this background, IMY finds that CDON's existing routine is not disproportionate and thus not in violation of the data protection regulation, provided that the company only collects the information that appears from the routine in situations where there is reason to doubt the identity of the data subject and that then only the information that is necessary to identify the data subject is requested. Choice of intervention From article 58.2 i and article 83.2 of the data protection regulation it appears that IMY has power to impose administrative penalty charges in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, administrative penalty fees are imposed in addition to or instead of the other measures referred to in article 58.2 of the data protection regulation, such as injunctions and prohibitions. Further it appears from article 83.2 of the data protection regulation which factors must be taken into account decisions on administrative penalty charges must be imposed and upon determination of the amount of the fee. If it is a question of a minor violation, IMY receives according to what set out in recital 148 instead of imposing a penalty charge issue a reprimand under article 58.2 b of the data protection regulation. Consideration shall be given to aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, such as the nature of the violation, degree of severity and duration as well as previous violations of relevance. IMY notes the following relevant circumstances. The current supervision includes CDON AB's handling of five individual appellant's requests in the situation which the complaints concern. Page 9 of 11The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-10549 10(11) Date: 2023-03-31 The company has taken measures to make it easier for registered users to exercise their rights rights in accordance with the data protection regulation and changed its procedures so that they are compatible with the data protection regulation. Some measures had already been taken before this supervisory case was initiated. Furthermore, the observed violations occurred relatively far back in time. The company has not previously received any corrective action for breach of data protection regulations. Against this background, IMY finds that it is a question of such a minor violation in the sense referred to in recital 148 and that CDON AB should be given a reprimand according to Article 58.2 b of the data protection regulation for the violations found.

The Privacy Protection Authority gives Rebtel Networks AB a reprimand according to Article 58 (2) (b) of the Data Protection Regulation. Report on the supervisory matter The Privacy Protection Authority (IMY) has initiated supervision regarding Rebtel Networks AB (the company) in connection with a complaint. The complaint has been submitted to IMY, i as the responsible supervisory authority in accordance with Article 56 of the Data Protection Regulation. The transfer has taken place from the supervisory authority in the country where the complainant has left lodged its complaint (Spain) in accordance with the provisions of the Regulation on cooperation in cross-border treatment. The complaint alleges that the complainant unsuccessfully tried to persuade the company to stop sending unsolicited emails after deleting her account. She has on four occasions requested removal and the company has each time confirmed that her Postal address: information has been deleted and she would not receive any more messages, but she has Box 8114 then each time receive a new email asking her to provide feedback 104 20 Stockholm about the service. She has also tried to use the ""unregister"" link provided in each e-mail Website: www.imy.se E-mail: imy@imy.se REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of Telephone: natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and on 08-657 61 00 Repeal of Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Regulation). Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2020-10561 2 (5) Date: 2021-03-23 mail, but it has not worked either. Against this background, she believes that the company has breached its obligations under Article 17 of the Data Protection Regulation. Rebtel Networks AB has mainly stated the following. The company received a request for deletion from the complainant on September 18, 2019. I subsequently, however, it can be stated that it was not handled as a request for deletion under the Data Protection Regulation, even if certain data were deleted. This is the reason for further e-mail in the form of a reminder of a survey for customer survey has been sent to the complainant. This has happened during the period up to and with effect from 1 October 2019, ie not after the deadline of one month applies under the Data Protection Regulation to comply with a deletion request. Remaining data was deleted on November 9, 2020, except for those that are necessary to be able to handle the current supervisory matter. The company informed complainant about this on 20 November 2020. Due to this supervisory matter, the company has taken special measures to strengthen their established processes and procedures for identifying a request under the Data Protection Regulation. This includes above all that further training of its customer service agents. The company has further improved its so-called data triggers in its customer service tools. The company's investigation of the complainant's case showed that it did not had been flagged as a matter under the Data Protection Regulation as the data application did not perceived any reference to the Data Protection Regulation in Spanish. The processing has taken place through correspondence. Given that it applies cross-border treatment, IMY has used the mechanisms of cooperation and uniformity contained in Chapter VII of the Data Protection Regulation. Affected regulators have been the data protection authorities in Spain, Germany, Norway, Italy and France. Justification of decision Applicable regulations According to Article 12 (3) of the Data Protection Regulation, the controller shall: request without undue delay and in any case no later than one month after to have received the request to provide the data subject with information on the measures taken taken in accordance with Article 17. This period may, if necessary, be extended by a further two months, taking into account the complexity of the request and the number received requests. The personal data controller shall notify the data subject of a such extension within one month of receipt of the request and state the reasons to the delay. According to Article 17 (1) (a), the data subject shall have the right to be informed by the controller without undue delay have their personal data deleted and it the person responsible for personal data shall be obliged to delete without undue delay personal data if the personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which which they have collected or otherwise treated. According to Article 17 (3) (b), this shall not be the case apply to the extent that the processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation requiring treatment under Union law.Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2020-10561 3 (5) Date: 2021-03-23 The Integrity Protection Authority's assessment Has there been a breach of the Data Protection Regulation? The company has stated that the reason for the complainant's request for deletion of the 18th September 2019 was not handled until November 9, 2020 due to the company not perceived it as a request for deletion. In the IMY's view, however, it has been made clear in the request that it registered wanted to exercise their right to deletion. Because some data was deleted only on 9 November 2020 did Rebtel Networks AB process personal data in violation with Article 17 of the Data Protection Regulation by not without undue delay first it 9 November 2020 delete the personal data requested by the complainant on 18 September 2019. However, the company has been justified in retaining the information needed for to be able to show that the request has been handled in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. The company has stated that no further e-mails have been sent since October 2, 2019 and that this is within the time limit of one month provided for in Article 12 (3) and 17 the Data Protection Regulation. However, the company was incorrect in its reply to the complainant on 22 September 2019 stated that the information had been deleted and that the complainant would not receive a few more mailings. Rebtel Networks AB thereby violates Article 12 (3) Data Protection Regulation provided incorrect information on what measures - that the data had been deleted - which has been taken as a result of the complainant's request. Despite the fact that the company, on 22 September 2019, informed the complainant that no more e- mailing if customer satisfaction should take place, the complainant has received another four such mailings. The four mailings were made on 22 and 25 September and on 1 and 2 October 2019. However, the IMY notes that this is a relatively short time after request for deletion was made and considers that it is within the time limit the company had undertaken to take action if the request had been handled correctly. Choice of intervention Article 58 (2) (i) and Article 83 (2) state that the IMY has the power to impose administrative penalty fees in accordance with Article 83. the circumstances of the individual case, administrative penalty fees shall be imposed in addition to or in place of the other measures referred to in Article 58 (2), such as: injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83 (2) sets out the factors to be taken into account taken into account when deciding whether to impose administrative penalty fees and at determining the amount of the fee. In the case of a minor infringement, IMY as stated in recital 148 instead of imposing a penalty fee issue one reprimand under Article 58 (2) (b). Account shall be taken of aggravating and mitigating circumstances circumstances of the case, such as the nature, severity and duration of the infringement as well as previous violations of relevance. The company has stated that the reason for the complainant's request for deletion is not was handled correctly mainly due to a mistake in the company's customer service and customer service tools. Due to what happened, the company has stated that it has taken action specific organizational and technical measures to strengthen their established processes and procedures for identifying a request under the Data Protection Regulation. In an overall assessment of the circumstances, the IMY finds that it is a question of less infringements within the meaning of recital 148 and that Rebtel Networks AB thereforeIntegrittsskyddsmyndigheten Record number: DI-2020-10561 4 (5) Date: 2021-03-23 shall be reprimanded in accordance with Article 58 (2) (b) of the Data Protection Regulation for those found the infringements.

The measures shall be implemented no later than two weeks after this decision has become final. Report on the supervisory matter The Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) has initiated supervision regarding Nordax Bank AB (Nordax or the company) due to a complaint. The complaint has been submitted to IMY, as responsible supervisory authority for the company’s operations pursuant to Article 56 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The handover has been made from the supervisory authority of the country where the complainant has lodged their complaint (Norway) in accordance with the Regulation’s provisions on cooperation in cross-border processing. The investigation in the case has been carried out through correspondence. In the light of a complaint relating to cross-border processing, IMY has used the mechanisms for cooperation and consistency contained in Chapter VII of the GDPR. The supervisory authorities concerned have been the data protection authorities in Norway, Denmark, Finland and Germany. The complaint The complaint states the following. The complaint alleges that the company has not dealt with the complainant’s requests to exercise the complainant’s rights under the GDPR in relation to the right of access pursuant to Article 15, the right of erasure pursuant to Article 17 and objection to obtaining personal data processed for direct marketing purposes as referred to in Article 21(2). E-mail correspondence with the company is attached to the complaint. What Nordax has stated Nordax has mainly stated the following.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: 2020-10696 3(11) Date:2022-06-27 Nordax is the data controller for the processing to which the complaint relates. The processing is carried out by Nordax personal data processor Iper Direkt AB (Iper) on behalf of Nordax and for direct marketing purposes, which is regulated in agreements between Nordax and Iper. Nordax determines the purposes and means of the processing. The relationship can be compared to the example set out in the EDPB Guidelines 07/2020 on the terms “controller” and “processor” in GDPR, (“Example: market research”). 2 Iper is responsible and the controller of the address register and responsible for managing the rights of data subjects whose personal data are available in this address register. Based on these, Iper makes, on behalf of Nordax, a selection from its address register and provides the addresses to another data processor that Nordax uses to carry out the marketing mailings. Nordax does not process or store any personal data since the data provided by Iper to Nordax is de-identified. Right of access Nordax Bank AB originally received a request for access from the complainant on 5 December 2018. The request concerned ""information on all data relating to me as you have stored and what the data is used for"". The complainant’s request was answered by email on 6 December 2018 with the information that the complainant’s personal data are not processed by Nordax why a request for access (or erasure) could not be handled. Nordax states that, as a data controller, however, the company should have interpreted this as a request under Article 15 of the GDPR and provided the complainant with access to personal data with the help of the personal data processor Iper in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the GDPR. Nordax took the view that the complainant´s main request was not a request of access to personal data pursuant to Article 15. In the light of the information in the complainant’s email and that the complainant did not contact Nordax after a block on direct marketing was established in respect of the complainant on 9 July 2019, Nordax considered that the complainant’s primary wish was to be blocked against addressed direct marketing from the company. Nordax believes that the complainant considers that the request for objection has been dealt with but can definitely comply with the complainant’s request for access if the complainant still wishes to exercise its right to access to the personal data. Right to erasure The complainant´s request for erasure was received on 5 December 2018 and Nordax replied to it on 6December 2018. It was clear from the reply that the company did not consider that it stored the complainant´s personal data, why any erasure of data at Nordax could not be done. It is the address provider Iper, Nordax data processor, who is reported to have stored the complainant’s personal data at the time of the complainant’s request. Iper is controller of the address register for which Nordax receives addresses for direct marketing mailings. Nordax does not have the ability to erase personal data in Iper’s register. It is against this background that Nordax has not complied with the complainant’s request for erasure. Furthermore, Nordax states that the company is currently processing personal data regarding the complainant in order to maintain a block on addressed direct marketing, which is necessary to comply with a legal obligation. Nordax has by e-mail on 6 December 2018 and 16July 2019 provided general information to the complainant that Nordax may process the complainant’s personal data in order to maintain a block on addressed direct marketing. Personal data of the complainant is also being processed to deal with the ongoing supervisory case which will be discontinued when the enforcement case is closed. The company has not interpreted the complainant´s 2 EDPB 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR, 2,0, page 19.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: 2020-10696 4(11) Date:2022-06-27 request for erasure in such a way that it would have included these ongoing processes of personal data. Right of objection The complainant submitted a request for access and deletion on 5December 2018 which Nordax replied on 6December 2018. In the light of the information in the complainant´s request Nordax presumed that the complainant had received addressed direct marketing mailings of Nordax products. Therefore, Nordax provided information on how the complainant should proceed with a block against further direct marketing mailings of Nordax products. In order to block an individual against addressed direct marketing Nordax needs information about the individual’s pre- and surname and full address which the company informed the complainant about. Nordax never received additional information from the complainant and could not therefore block the complainant from the addressed direct marketing mailings. On 11February 2019, the complainant submitted a further request for access and erasure and objection to receiving direct marketing mailings. Nordax responded to the complainant´s request on 12 February 2019 by referring to an earlier reply to the request for access and erasure and stated that Nordax has grant the complainant´s request to object to receiving further direct marketing. However, the complainant was wrongly informed on that occasion that Nordax had taken measures to prevent the complainant from receiving further direct marketing mailings. Nordax believes that the handling of the case in question has failed due to the human factor and the company reviews its procedures for individuals who wish to object to direct marketing mailings because of this, to ensure that incorrect information is not sent again. The complainant´s lodged a further complaint on 9July 2019, which Nordax once again replied with information on how the complainant should proceed in order to block himself against addressed direct marketing mailings. At the time of receipt of this objection, the complainant was also finally blocked against further addressed direct marketing mailing from Nordax products. However, Nordax has not informed that complainant was blocked from such further direct marketing mailings of Nordax products. Nor did the complainant contact Nordax after 9July 2019. Justification of the decision Applicable provisions, etc. Data controller The controller, as defined in Article 4(7) of the GDPR, means the natural or legal person which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. In the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts data controller and processor in the General Data Protection Regulation the following is mentioned concerning the respective roles of processors and controllers in the exercise of data subjects’ rights: “It is crucial to bear in mind that, although the practical management ofPrivacy Protection Authority Our ref: 2020-10696 5(11) Date:2022-06-27 individual requests can be outsourced to the processor, the controller bears the responsibility for complying with such requests. Therefore, the assessment as to whether requests by data subjects are admissible and/or the requirements set by the GDPR are met should be performed by the controller, either on a case-by- case basis or through clear instructions provided to the processor in the contract before the start of the processing. Also, the deadlines set out by Chapter III cannot be extended by the controller based on the fact that the necessary information must be provided by the processor.” 3 It also states the following in an example, to which Nordax refers to concerning the relationship between Nordax and Iper: “Example: Market research 1 Company ABC wishes to understand which types of consumers are most likely to be interested in its products and contracts a service provider, XYZ, to obtain the relevant information. Company ABC instructs XYZ on what type of information it is interested in and provides a list of questions to be asked to those participating in the market research. Company ABC receives only statistical information (e.g., identifying consumer trends per region) from XYZ and does not have access to the personal data itself. Nevertheless, Company ABC decided that the processing should take place, the processing is carried out for its purpose and its activity and it has provided XYZ with detailed instructions on what information to collect. Company ABC is therefore still to be considered a controller with respect of the processing of personal data that takes place in order to deliver the information it has requested. XYZ may only process the data for the purpose given by Company ABC and according to its detailed instructions and is therefore to be regarded as processor.” 4 In the literature, Öman points out the following. “The legal person which engages any other legal person to process personal data, e.g. for storing and disseminating or for collecting and processing the personal data, is normally considered to be the data controller and the hired as a personal data processor. This applies even if it is the hired company and not the company who hires who has the knowledge of how to best process the personal data, such as how to store, collect, disseminate and process them, and the resources to do it. In fact, the company who hires has decided the means of processing of the personal data by employing a company that can use certain methods. This may involve outsourcing IT operations or to hire a company to collect personal data within the framework of a market research."" Rights of the data subject According to Article 12(3) of the GDPR, the controller shall provide information on action taken on a request under Articles 15 to 22 to the data subject without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. That period may be extended by two further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. The controller shall inform the data subject of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay. Pursuant to Article 12(6), where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject. 3EDPB 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR, 2,0, paragraph 132. 4EDPB 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR, 2,0, page 19.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: 2020-10696 6(11) Date:2022-06-27 Under Article 15(1), the data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data from the controller. Pursuant to Article 17(1), the data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay under certain conditions set out in the current article. Under Article 21(2) and (3), the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes concerning him or her. Where the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes. Assessment of the Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) On the basis of the complaint in this case, IMY examined the company’s conduct in the individual case. Therefore IMY will not consider whether the company’s current procedure for processing requests is compatible with the GDPR, but may take into account possible improvements when considering choice of corrective measures. Is Nordax’s data controller for the processing in question and has the company been obliged to deal with the complainant´s requests to exercise his rights? The question in this case is whether Nordax has had an obligation to comply with the complainant’s requests for access, erasure and objection under the GDPR and in in that case, if the company handled the complainant´s requests correctly. In order to investigate this, IMY first needs to consider whether Nordax is the controller of personal data for the processing of personal data in this case. Nordax has stated that the company is the data controller for the processing. The processing consists of the fact that the company Iper — on behalf of Nordax and based on selection criteria that Nordax determines — makes a selection from Iper’s address register and provides addresses for the sending of direct marketing to a third company that Nordax hires to make the mailings. Nordax argues that the company itself does not deal with any data, as the data provided by Iper to Nordax are de- identified. The investigation shows that Nordax initially failed to comply with the complainanat´s first requests for access and erasure pursuant to Articles 15 and 17 on the grounds that the Company does not process or store the complainant’s personal data and that instead the complainant should refer directly to Iper. IMY notes, however, that it is not required to have access to or store personal data in order to be considered to be data controller for a particular processing operation. What matters is who decides the purposes and means of the processing. Since the processing consisting of the selection from Iper´s address register for direct marketing is carried out on behalf of Nordax and based on the selection criteria that Nordax has decided, IMY believes that Nordax determines the purpose and means of the processing and is therefore the controller for the processing. This means that Nordax is responsible for handling the complainant’s requests, either by handling the request itself or to give clear instructions to for example a data processor, in order forPrivacy Protection Authority Our ref: 2020-10696 7(11) Date:2022-06-27 the data processor to be able to do so. Nordax’s argument that it is not responsible for Iper’s address register does not alter that. What Nordax has stated that Nordax receives only de-identified data from Iper is irrelevant for the company’s responsibility to deal with the complainant´s requests. Nordax is responsible for the processing of personal data carried out by Iper namely the selection of the advertising received by the complainant to which the complaint relates. There is therefore no need to consider whether the data received by Nordax are de-identified in such a way that they are not personal data. IMY points out that even information that can directly or indirectly identify a natural person is personal data, including information that has been encoded, encrypted or pseudonymised but which can be linked to a natural person with help of additional information. Since IMY has found that Nordax is the data controller for the processing that the complaint concerns and is therefore responsible for ensuring that the complainant’s requests to exercise its rights under the GDPR are dealt with, IMY goes on to investigate whether Nordax handled the requests correctly under the Regulation. Has Nordax handled the complainant’s requests to exercise its rights been in compliance with the GDPR? Request for access It is apparent from the investigation that the complainant submitted its first request to access to the company on 5December 2018. The request was worded in such a way that the complainant would like to receive access to all data stored by the company on the complainant and information about what the data was used for. Nordax did not take any action other than to inform the complainant that the complainant´s personal data were not being processed by the company and that the request could therefore not be met. At the same time, Nordax informed of its process for selection and dispatch of addressed direct marketing and which address provider Nordax uses for selection of addresses. The complainant subsequently submitted its second request for access on 11February 2019, to which Nordax replied on 12February by referring to its previous reply to the complainant. During the investigation Nordax stated that it should have interpreted the complainant´s requests as a request to exercise their right of access under Article 15 of the GDPR and provided the complainant with the data and information to which the complainant was entitled too with the assistance of Iper. IMY shares this assessment. IMY notes in that regard that it is true that, in its request, the complainant referred to the storage data, but that nevertheless, it should have been clear to Nordax that the complainant intended to exercise its full right of access and that it is Nordax responsibility, such as data controller for the processing, to ensure that the request was handled. Furthermore, IMY notes that Nordax has still not complied with the request even though the company now admits that the company is obliged to do so. Nordax has stated that it can comply with the complainant’s request for access if the complainant so wishes. IMY notes, however, that there has been no evidence to suggest that the request still wouldn’t be relevant, such as the fact that the complainant would have 5EDPB 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR, 2,0, paragraph 132.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: 2020-10696 8(11) Date:2022-06-27 withdrawn it. By failing to comply with the applicant’s request for access Nordax has processed personal data in violation of Article 15 of the GDPR. Request for deletion It is apparent from the investigation that, on 5December 2018, the complainant also submitted his first request for deletion. Nordax did not take any action other than to inform the complainant that the complainant´s personal data were not processed by the company and that the request could therefore not be met. At the same time, Nordax informed of its process for selection and dispatch of addressed direct marketing and which address provider Nordax uses for selection of addresses. The complainant subsequently submitted its second request for deletion on 11February 2019, to which Nordax replied on 12February by referring to its previous reply to the complainant. Article 17(3) of the GDPR provides for an exhaustive demonstration of the grounds on which a request for erasure may be rejected. That the controller not storing the data being processed is not such a basis. As IMY has stated above, the company is obliged to deal with the complainant’s requests, which the company haven't done. Nordax thus processes personal data in violation of Article 17 of the GDPR by not without undue delay handle the complainant’s requests for erasure. Request for objection The investigation shows that Nordax perceived that, on 5December 2018, the complainant also submitted an objection to the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes pursuant to Article 21(2) GDPR. Nordax informed the complainant how the complainant could proceed to object to further direct marketing and requested additional information from the complainant in order to be able to fulfil that right. However, the complainant did not return with additional information. IMY considers that, as the request was worded, the complainant had not invoked its right of objecting to direct marketing. IMY therefore notes that Nordax did not have any obligation to deal with it as such a request, but welcomes the fact that Nordax nevertheless provided information on how the complainant could proceed to block further direct marketing. However, the complainant lodged its first actual request of objection to further direct marketing on 11February 2019. Nordax provided information that the complainant had been blocked against further direct marketing, but the information at this point was incorrect. Because Nordax left incorrect information to the complainant on 12February 2019 on the measures taken on the basis of the complainant´s request for objection meaning that the complainant´s information was blocked for further direct marketing mailings Nordax has acted in violation of article 12.3. The complainant lodged its second objection on 9July 2019. Nordax replied to the complainant on 16July 2019 referring to previous replies on how the complainant could try to block him or herself from further marketing. The company however blocked, the complainant against further addressed direct marketing on 9July 2019, but did not inform the complainant of this measure. Against this background, IMY takes the view that Nordax has satisfied the complainant´s second request of objection pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: 2020-10696 9(11) Date:2022-06-27 In Nordax reply to the second request, the company asked the complainant to submit additional information in order to comply with the request, even though the existing information in the request according to Nordax, was sufficient to actually satisfy the request directly. For this reason Nordax has requested additional information that has not been necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject in violation of 12(6). Furthermore, Nordax did not inform the complainant that, in accordance with its second requests for objection the complainant was blocked against further addressed direct marketing. By doing so, Nordax has failed to fulfil its obligation under Article 12(3) to provide the data subject with information on the measures taken under Article 21 and thus processed personal data in breach of Article 12(3) of the GDPR. Choice of corrective measure It follows from Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83(2) of the GDPR that the IMY has the power to impose administrative fines in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the circumstances of the case, administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or in place of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2), such as injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83(2) provides which factors are to be taken into account when deciding on administrative fines and in determining the amount of the fine. In the case of a minor infringement, as stated in recital 148, IMY may, instead of imposing a fine, issue a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b). Factors to consider is the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement and past relevant infringements. IMY notes the following relevant facts. Nordax have stated that they have taken action by reviewing their procedures to ensure that incorrect information should not be sent again and reviewing how the company handles data subjects’ rights regarding processing carried out on the company’s behalf by the company’s processor. According to IMY the noted infringements found occurred relatively far back in time, partly due to the human factor and has affected one person. In addition, the company has not previously acted in breach of the GDPR. Against this background IMY considers that it is a minor infringement within the meaning of recital 148 and that Nordax Bank AB must be given a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR. Since the company has not handled the complainat´s request for access even though the company is obliged to do so, IMY considers that there is reason in accordance with Article 58(2)(c) to order the company to comply with the complainant´s request to exercise its right of access under Article 15 with exception for information which is subject to any applicable derogation provided for in Article 15(4).This is done by providing the complainant access to all personal data that Nordax process regarding the complainant by arranging a copy to the complainant of the personal data referred to in Article 15(3) and provide information pursuant to points (a) to (h) of Article 15(1) and 15.2. The measures shall be implemented no later than two weeks after this decision has become final. The company has also failed to deal with the complainant’s request for erasure even though the company is obliged to do so. IMY therefore considers that it is appropriate, on the basis of Article 58.2(d) to order the company to deal with the complainant’s request for erasure of all personal data referred to in Article 17 by considering whetherPrivacy Protection Authority Our ref: 2020-10696 10(11) Date:2022-06-27 there is personal data which the company is obliged to erase in accordance with Article 17 and, if so, erase the information and inform the complainant in accordance with Article 12(3) or (4). Measures shall be completed no later than two weeks after the date on which this decision has become final. Furthermore, Nordax did not inform the complainant about the measure which been taken, namely that the complainant been blocked for further addressed direct marketing, in response to the complainant’s second request to exercise the right of objection to process for direct marketing purposes. IMY considers that it is appropriate, pursuant to Article 58(2)(d), to order the company to in accordance with Article 12(3), provide the complainant with information on the measures which been taken in response to the complainant’s request to exercise his right of objection to processing for direct marketing purposes. The measures shall be implemented no later than two weeks after this decision has become final. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This decision has been approved by the specially appointed decision-maker after presentation by legal advisorPrivacy Protection Authority Our ref: 2020-10696 11(11) Date:2022-06-27 How to appeal If you want to appeal the decision, you should write to the Authority for Privacy Protection.

The Privacy Protection Authority orders Coop Sverige Aktiebolag with the support of article 58.2 d of the data protection regulation to ensure that the company's processing of personal data within the framework of Coop Sverige Aktiebolag's use of the Google Analytics tool complies with Article 44 and other provisions of Chapter V. This shall especially happen by Coop Sverige Aktiebolag ceasing to use that version of the Google Analytics tool used on August 14, 2020, if not sufficient protective measures have been taken. The measures must be completed no later than one month after this decision gained legal force. 1 Description of the supervisory matter 1.1 The processing The Swedish Privacy Protection Agency (IMY) has started supervision regarding Coop Sverige AB (hereinafter ""Coop"" or ""the company"") due to a complaint. The complaint concerns a alleged violation of the provisions of Chapter V of the Data Protection Ordinance linked to the transfer of the complainant's personal data to third countries. The transfer is alleged to have happened when the complainant visited the company's website, www.coop.se (hereinafter ""the company's website” or the “Website”) through the Google Analytics tool (below “The Tool”) provided by Google LLC. The complaint has been handed over to IMY, in its capacity as the responsible supervisory authority according to Article 56 of the Data Protection Regulation. The handover has taken place from the supervisory authority in the country where the complainant has filed his complaint (Austria) in accordance with the regulation's provisions on cooperation in cross-border processing. The proceedings at IMY have taken place through an exchange of letters. 1.2 What is stated in the complaint The complaint essentially states the following. On August 14, 2020, the complainant visited Coop's website. During the visit, the complainant signed in to his Google account, which is linked to the complainant's email address. The company had implemented a Javascript code for Google services on its website, including Google Analytics. In accordance with clause 5.1.1 b of the terms of Google's processing of personal data for Google's advertising products and also Google's terms and conditions for processing ""the New Order Data Processing Conditions for Google Advertising Products"" Google processes personal data of the data controller (i.e. 1 regarding the processing of personal data and about the free flow of such data and about the cancellation of avr med directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). Page 3 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 4(24) Date: 2023-06-30 the company's) account. Google LLC must therefore, according to the above-mentioned conditions, be classified as the company's personal data assistant. During the complainant's visit to the company's website, the complainant was treated personal data by Coop, at least the complainant's IP address and data collected through cookies. Some of the data collected was transferred directly to Google. IN in accordance with clause 10 of the terms on the processing of personal data for Googles advertising products, Coop has approved that Google may process personal data about the appellant in the United States. Such transfer of data requires legal support in accordance with chapter V of the data protection regulation. According to the judgment of the European Court of Justice Facebook Ireland and Schrems (Schrems II), 2 the company can no longer rely on a decision on an adequate level of protection for the transfer of data to the United States according to Article 45 of the Data Protection Regulation. The company should not base the transfer of data on standardized data protection regulations according to article 46.2 c of the data protection regulation if the recipient country does not ensure adequate protection with regard to Union law for the personal data that is transferred. 1.3 What Coop has stated Coop Sverige AB has essentially stated the following. 1.3.1 Who has implemented the Tool and for what purpose, etc. Coop has made the decision to implement the Tool on the Website, which has happened by embedding the code for the tool on the Website. The tool is still actively. The company is not established in any other member state than Sweden and has not made such a decision for any other European website. The purpose of Coop's use of the Tool is to fulfill the purpose of developing and improve Coop's operations, products and services. The tool is used, for example, for to analyze and evaluate (i) how registered users use coop.se, (ii) Coop's customer personalization on coop.se and (iii) Coop's advertising campaigns. Based on those insights that the tool provides, Coop can make decisions about measures that improve and optimize Coop's products, services (e.g. functions offered on coop.se and their placement or personification on coop.se) and marketing or make decisions about new products or services must be developed. For this purpose it is necessary to keep relevant unique identifiers for the analyzes performed in order to create reliable and verifiable results. The tool is used to create analyzes and reports that facilitate decision-making linked to the objectives 1) provide a personal experience in Coop's digital channels and 2) marketing and communication in Coops and in third party digital channels. 2 ECJ judgment Facebook Ireland and Schrems (Schrems II), C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559. Page 4 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 5(24) Date: 2023-06-30 Coop's purpose with the Tool can also be fulfilled with the implementation of a so-called the server side container, which means that the visitor's IP address should not be sent to The tool (see below). Coop does not need IP addresses as identifiers to comply the purpose of the Tool. The purpose of the Tool is to create reports for decision basis for the purpose of developing and improving Coop's operations, products and services. Examples of information needed in these reports. Could be any exposures that lead to a purchase in order to be able to evaluate their effectiveness, e.g. product displays, recipe displays or campaigns. In this context, it is therefore the measurement, not the IP address, which is decisive for whether the purpose of the Tool can fulfilled. Coop's customers are in the Swedish market and Coop only targets it Swedish market. Practical reasons and the prohibition regarding discrimination of consumers, and in some cases also traders, according to the geoblocking regulation 3 however, means that there is no restriction on who can visit Coops website. Coop does not specifically analyze traffic to the website from which countries comes . 1.3.2 Recipient of the data Within the scope of Coop's use of the Tool on the Website is provided personal data out to a number of actors, all of whom are personal data processors or subcontractors of Coop, including Google LLC, Google Ireland Ltd and their assistants. 1.3.3 The data processed in the Tool and what constitutes it personal data Within the framework of Coop's use of the Tool on the Website, the company processes and its personal data assistants (the Recipients) the information specified below. 1. User behavior on the website based on values submitted via variables on the website (eg filterCombination, Page title, Referrer or storeName). 2. Device information (eg flashVersion, javaEnabled, language or color choice of screen). 3. Customer status (i.e. if the user visits Coop's website in logged in or logged out mode or as a business customer). 4. Online identifiers (e.g. IP address, userID, transactionID, clientlD, gclid, dclid or Device ID). 5. Transaction data based on values submitted via site variables (such as antalKop, Transaction - dimension50 (boughtRecipe), Transaction - dimension7 (deliveryMethod), orderlD or deliveryTime). 1.3.4 Categories of persons affected by the processing The categories of persons affected by the processing are visitors, private customers (non-member with an account), business customers and members of Coop Medlem. The tool is not set up and is not used to treat particular categories of personal data or personal data of particularly vulnerable persons. 3Regulation (EU) 2018/302 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 February 2018 on measures against unjustified geoblocking and other forms of discrimination based on customers' nationality, place of residence or place of establishment in the internal market. Page 5 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 6(24) Date: 2023-06-30 1.3.5 When the code for the Tool is executed and Recipient access is provided When a user has made their consent choices, the user's personal data, i varying extent, to be sent to the Tool. The content is integrated and run after conditions in Coop's consent manager are met. 1.3.6 How long the personal data processed is stored The personal data processed in the Tool is stored for a maximum of 38 months and is subsequently deleted. 1.3.7 In which countries the personal data is processed The personal data is processed in the United States, among other places. 1.3.8 Coop's relationship with Google LCC Coop purchases the license for the Tool through a reseller that constitutes Coops personal data assistant. Coop and the personal data assistant have entered into an agreement personal data assistant agreement that regulates the set-up and administration of the Tool. The personal data assistant in turn independently administers all operations in relationship with Google. For example, the personal data assistant handles the whole set of the Tool, compensation for the service and contacts with Google regarding support. In other words, Google acts exclusively on instructions from Coops personal data assistant. Google further applies contractual terms between itself and the retailer that regulates Google's processing of personal data as a personal data processor in relation to the retailer, whereby the retailer is Coop's personal data assistant. Google will be thereby Coop's assistant. This view of the distribution of roles is consistent with The view of Coop's personal data officer and Google. In addition to this, the settings that enables the use of personal data in the Tool for Google's own purposes deactivated. In light of (i) that Coop's personal data assistant acts in accordance with Coop's instructions, (ii) how the contract structure looks like and how the parties involved look at it the distribution of roles and (iii) that data sharing for Google's own purposes is disabled Coop's assessment that Google constitutes a subsidiary of Coop is linked to personal data processing in the Tool. 1.3.9 Ensuring that the processing does not take place for the Recipients' own purposes Coop releases the personal data to its personal data assistants. Coop has entered personal data processing agreement with these. The agreements contain clauses concerning Coop's right to audit/audit through which Coop can check that the personal data assistant does not processes personal data for its own purposes or for the purposes of third parties. As part of its work with the data protection regulation, Coop applies a routine to ensure regulatory compliance. The routine includes an annual cycle whose purpose is to secure good regulatory compliance over time. The annual wheel is divided into four parts where follow-up of assistant relations are included in the third part. Within the framework of the follow-up work according to annual cycle, there is an opportunity to ensure that personal data assistants only process personal data on behalf of Coop. In connection with the work regarding the implementation of the consent manager, has in addition additional measures have been taken to ensure that Coop does not allow Recipients processes personal data belonging to Coop's visitors, customers and members for Page 6 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 7(24) Date: 2023-06-30 their own purposes. There are routines that state that each responsible employee must ensure that no sharing of personal data takes place through solutions in the service. 1.3.10 Description of Coop's use of the Tool Coop sends various identifiers via the measurement set up on the company's website. Common to all identifiers is that these are unique for the interactions of the data subjects related to the website www.coop.se. In other words, a registered person is not attributed to one and the same identifier that applies to websites other than the Coop website. The example below describes a report where Coop wants to understand which products are popular to shop online and how these have been exposed to the customer at Coops website. When the customer completes their purchase in Coop's e-commerce, the following is sent information for the Tool (on the quote variable, description and example of value): • Id - Product ID – 3600542020855 • Variant – Size of the packaging (eg 200 g etc.) – undefined • Price – The price of the product – 26.5 • List – The products on the site are presented in a product list which may have different name, e.g. product search, Site search, Search dropdown - product search • listPosition – What position the list has among other product lists (from 0 and upwards) – 0 • position – What place the product has in the product list (from 0 and up) – 0 • name – Product name – Balsam Goodbye Damage • brand – Brand – Fructis • category – Product category area – Beauty & Hygiene - Hair care - Conditioner The identifiers transmitted are the following: 1. clientID – used to be able to determine whether a registered person is new or recurrent. New clientIDs are generated if a registrant has cleared theirs cookies and re-enters the website. 2. userID – generated for registered users with a login account on coop.se and used to determine whether a data subject has a login account or not. 3. gclid and dclid – generated for each unique ad click. The aim is to be able to attribute a click to a specific ad in order to, for example, get aggregated information about how many times the ad has been viewed or how many people have interacted with it. 4. transactionID – generated in connection with a purchase on coop.se and corresponds to an order number. Based on the information stated above, Coop can, among other things, draw conclusions about popular products that lead to purchase, how the customer journey started and what type of registered person who completed the purchase (e.g. new or returning member/customer or member/customer with login account). These conclusions are not dependent on registrants' public IP addresses are sent to the Tool and the purpose can thus be fulfilled regardless of whether public IP addresses are sent or not. In light of the implementation of the server side container, Coop also wishes to clarify that registered IP addresses are only processed through the following treatments: 1) collection on the company's website, 2) transfer to server side the container and 3) converting the unique IP addresses to a generic IP address for Page 7 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 8(24) Date: 2023-06-30 the server side container. Collection, transfer and conversion are done in real time and none public IP addresses are stored. 1.3.11 Own checks on transfers affected by the Schrems II judgment In light of the Schrems II judgment, Coop has carried out work to review their third country transfers. In the autumn of 2021, Coop has also carried out an audit of The tool where Coop has been able to establish that international data transfers are taking place through use of the Tool. As part of this work, it has been undertaken on an ongoing basis measures to further increase privacy protection related to the data subjects whose personal data is affected. 1.3.12 Transfer tool according to chapter V of the data protection regulation Transfers to third countries take place with the support of the European Commission standard contract clauses (personal data assistants), which are incorporated into that contract entered into between Google and Coop's personal data assistant. According to the agreement constitute Coop's personal data assistant exporter of the personal data to the Tool. Coop supports the data transfers to the USA on the standard contractual clauses for transfer of personal data to personal data processors in third countries. In this case, the standard contract clauses have been entered into between Google LLC and the company personal data assistant. In this context, it can be mentioned that Google provides standardized services and do not offer their customers the opportunity to negotiate the terms of their services. Because these are terms that are not subject to negotiation, no signed copies are available. Coop has instead attached them data processing conditions in which the standard contractual clauses have been incorporated and which apply in accordance with the agreement entered into by Coop's personal data assistant. Coop takes measures to ensure that the existing standard contract clauses always are updated according to the EU Commission's latest version of standard contract clauses. 1.3.13 Control of obstacles to enforcement in legislation in third countries Control of obstacles in third country legislation is within the scope of Coop's work to review your third country transfers. However, Coop has noted the criticism that the EU the court has directed against American law and takes this into account in the choice of supplementary protective measures. 1.3.14 Additional safeguards taken in addition to those taken by Google Implementation of additional protective measures is within the scope of Coop's work with to review their third country transfers. According to data from Google, provided several security measures that Google deems to constitute such additional safeguards which can be taken together with the standard contract clauses. Coop has also carried out work to establish a so-called server side container, i purpose of expanding control over how data is sent to the Tool. Coop believes that Google's contractual and organizational measures may be considered minimize the actual risk of disclosure of personal data to third countries i the end takes place. From Google's Transparency Report, Global requests for users information, however, it appears that Google regularly receives requests from Americans authorities about what applies when accessing personal data that Google stores. Coop's assessment is that the real risk of information being disclosed to American intelligence is small. However, it cannot be eliminated by either measures that Google or Coop take. Page 8 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 9(24) Date: 2023-06-30 Furthermore, Coop assesses that the supplementary measures taken to minimize the monitoring possibilities also strengthen the freedoms and rights of Coop's customers by these cannot be identified through the data that is transmitted. In summary, through these measures, only one and the same generic IP address transmitted to the Tool, regardless of the unique IP address of the data subject. Coop has also activated the function in the Tool for so-called IP anonymization, but in light of the server side container, this measure is, according to the company, redundant. 1.3.14.1 General about server side container A server side container is generally implemented to either enhance 1) website performance or 2) security. In terms of performance, fewer tags can be used in relation to the measurement set up on the Website, which means less code on the client side and, for example, that the website can load faster. In terms of security, visitors' data can be better protected and the website owner retains greater control over the data collected and distributed in an environment that controlled by the website owner. When data is first sent to a cloud-based solution this can be processed and redistributed with tags such as the website owner controls. 1.3.14.2 Coop's implementation of the server side container The purpose of the server side container that Coop has implemented is to improve the security related to the data sent. More specifically, the aim is to on a good and safely be able to protect the personal privacy of those registered. Server side the container acts as a proxy between the registrant's browser and the Tool where Coop has chosen to implement the server side container in a way that makes them the registered browser's public IP address is never transmitted to the Tool. Implementation can be described as follows. A registrant visits the website www.coop.se in your browser. The Google Analytics script is downloaded from the server side container instead of being downloaded directly from Google Analytics servers. This results in the registrant's IP address as well as information about user behavior, device information, customer status, online identifiers and transaction data (according to points 1–5 above under section 1.3.10) are transferred to the server side container, instead directly to Google Analytics. Once the Google Analytics script has been downloaded from the server side container, a new call is made from the server side container to Google Analytics servers. Since the call is made from the server side container, no transfer of the registrant's public IP address to Google Analytics. Coop has configured the server side container in such a way that all data as above, except it was recorded public IP address, passes through the server side container to Google Analytics. Google Analytics receives data sent from the server side container and that data (information) that has been sent is popularized in reports by the measurement set up on the website www.coop.se. The treatments that take place through the aforementioned – i.e. to receive, convert and forward the call - takes place in the working memory of the server side container. It means all processing takes place in real time and that no data is permanently stored. In other words, stored public IP addresses were not registered in the server side container and they are not exposed rather against Google Analytics servers. All communication from the browser, via server side container, to The tool is also encrypted. Page 9 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 10(24) Date: 2023-06-30 This process cannot be reversed as the information is not stored and the conversion not based on a one-to-one relationship that enables the use of a ""key"" to recreate the public IP addresses. Coop has activated Google's function for IP anonymization. It means that the IP address sent to the Tool is truncated. This is done by Google removing one part of the IP address before the IP address is stored on disk. For an IPv4 address, last is replaced the octet in the address with a zero. For an IPv6 address, the last 80 bits are replaced with zeros. The action cannot be reversed but as this action is done by Google i Coop has also chosen to implement the tool as a server side container. In Coop's case, the IP anonymization feature is enabled and applied to the generic IP address sent via the server side container. In context, however, the function is redundant considering that the server side container prevents the public of the registered IP addresses from being sent to the Tool. Coop's assessment is that server side the container as a measure is a sufficient protective measure, but that it does not harm that even have the IP anonymization function activated in the Tool. 1.4 What Google LCC has stated IMY has added to the case an opinion from Google LLC (Google) on April 9, 2021 which Google submitted to the Austrian supervisory authority. The statement answers questions which IMY and a number of supervisory authorities have asked Google due to in part joint handling of similar complaints received by these authorities. Coop has been given the opportunity to comment on Google LLC's opinion. By Google LLC's opinion states the following about the Tool. A JavaScript code is included on a web page. When a user visits (calls) a web page, the code triggers a download of a JavaScript file. Then performed the tracking operation of the Tool, which consists of collecting information related to to the call in different ways and sends the information to the Tool's servers. A website administrator who has integrated the Tool on his website can send instructions to Google for processing the data collected. These instructions are transmitted via the so-called tag manager that handles it tracking code that the webmaster has integrated into his website and via tag manager settings. Whoever integrated the Tool can do different things settings, for example regarding storage time. The tool also makes it possible for it which integrated it to monitor and maintain the stability of its website, for example by staying informed about events such as peaks in visitor traffic or lack of traffic. The tool also enables a website administrator to measure and optimize the effectiveness of advertising campaigns carried out using other tools from Google. In this context, the Tool collects the visitor's http calls and information about including the visitor's browser and operating system. According to Google, contains one http calls for any page information about the browser and device making the call, such as domain name, and information about the browser, such as type, reference and language. The tool stores and reads cookies in the visitor's browser in order to evaluate the visitor's session and other information about the call. Through these cookies enable the Tool to identify unique users (UUID) over browsing sessions, but the Tool cannot identify unique users in different browsers or units. If a website owner's website has its own authentication system Page 10 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 11(24) Date: 2023-06-30 can the website owner use the ID feature, to more accurately identify one users on all the devices and browsers they use to access the website. When the information is collected, it is transferred to the Tool's servers. All data that collected via The tool is stored in the United States. Google has introduced, among other things, the following contractual, organizational and technical safeguards to regulate transfers of data within the framework of The tool. Google has taken contractual and organizational safeguards such as to the company always conducts a thorough examination of a request for access from government authorities on user data can be implemented. It is lawyers/specially trained staff conducting these trials and investigating whether such a request is compliant with applicable laws and Google's guidelines. Those registered are informed the disclosure, unless prohibited by law or would adversely affect one emergency. Google has also published a policy on the company's website about how a such requests for access by governmental authorities of user data shall be implemented. Google has taken technical protective measures such as protecting personal data from interception when transferring data in the Tool. By default using HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which instructs browsers as http to SSL (HTTPS) to use an encryption protocol for all communications between end users, websites and the Tool's servers. Such encryption prevents intruders from passively listen to communications between websites and users. Google also uses an encryption technology to protect personal data, so-called “data in rest"" (""data at rest"") in data centers, where user data is stored on a disk or backup media to prevent unauthorized access to the data. In addition to the above measures, website owners can use IP anonymization through to use the settings provided by the Tool to limit Google's use of personal data. Such settings include above all that in the code for the Tool enable IP anonymization, which means that IP addresses are truncated and contributes to data minimization. If the IP anonymization service is fully used occurs the anonymization of the IP address almost immediately after the request has been received. Google also restricts access to the data from the Tool through authorization control as well as by all personnel having undergone training regarding information security. 2. Justification of the decision 2.1 The framework for the review Based on the complaint in the case, IMY has only examined whether Coop transfers personal data to the third country USA within the framework of the Tool and if the company has legal support for it in Chapter V of the Data Protection Regulation. The supervision does not cover if the company's personal data processing in general is compatible with the data protection regulation. Page 11 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 12(24) Date: 2023-06-30 2.2 This concerns the processing of personal data 2.2.1 Applicable regulations, etc. In order for the data protection regulation to be applicable, it is required that personal data treated. According to Article 1.2, the Data Protection Regulation aims to protect the data of natural persons fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their right to the protection of personal data. According to Article 4.1 of the regulation, personal data is ""any information relating to a identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as a data subject), whereby a identifiable natural person is a person who can be directly or indirectly specifically identified referring to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, a location data or online identifiers or one or more factors that are specific to the natural person's physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity'. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, one should consider all the aids that, either of it personal data controller or by another person, may reasonably be used to directly or indirectly identify the natural person (reason 26 to data protection regulation). The term personal data can include all information, both objective and subjective information, provided that it ""refers"" to a specific person, which 4 they do if, due to their content, purpose or effect, they are linked to the person. The word ""indirectly"" in Article 4.1 of the Data Protection Regulation indicates that it is not necessary that the information itself makes it possible to identify the registered person for that to be a personal data. Recital 26 of the data protection regulation also states that in order to determine whether a natural person is identifiable, all aids, such as e.g. thinning (""singling out"" in the English language version), which, either of it personal data controller or by another person, may reasonably be used to directly or indirectly identify the natural person, is taken into account. To determine if aids can with reasonable probability be used to identify it the natural person should all objective factors, such as costs and time consumption for identification, taking into account both available technology at the time of processing, considered. It is clear from Article 4.5 of the regulation that pseudymisation is meant processing of personal data in a way that means that the personal data does not longer can be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of supplementary information, provided that this additional information is kept separately and is subject for technical and organizational measures that ensure that the personal data does not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. So-called ""web identifiers"" (sometimes referred to as ""online identifiers"") - e.g. IP addresses or information stored in cookies – can be used to identify a user, especially when combined with other similar types of information. According to recital 30 to data protection regulation, natural persons can be linked to online identifiers provided by their equipment, e.g. IP addresses, cookies or other identifiers. This can leave behind traces that, especially in combination with unique identifiers and other data such as collected, can be used to create profiles of natural persons and identify them. In the Breyer judgment, the European Court of Justice has determined that a person is not considered identifiable through some information about the risk of identification in practice is negligible, which it is 4 ECJ judgment Nowak, C-434/16, EU:C:2017:994, paragraphs 34–35. 5 CJEU judgment Breyer, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph 41. Page 12 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 13(24) Date: 2023-06-30 identification of the relevant person is prohibited by law or impossible to carry out i practice. However, the European Court of Justice has in the judgment M.I.C.M. from 2021 and in the judgment Breyer struck provided that dynamic IP addresses constitute personal data in relation to the person who processes them, when he also has a legal opportunity to identify the holders of the internet connections using the additional information provided by third parties 7 dispose of. 2.2.2 The Privacy Protection Authority's assessment To determine whether the information processed through the Tool constitutes personal data should IMY decide whether Google or Coop through the implementation of the Tool can identify individuals, e.g. the complainant, when visiting the Website or about the risk of 8 it is negligible. IMY considers the data processed to be personal data for the following reasons. The investigation shows that Coop implemented the Tool by inserting a JavaScript code (a tag), entered by Google in the source code of the Website. While the page is loaded in the visitor's browser, the JavaScript code from Google LLC's is loaded servers and run locally in the visitor's browser. A cookie is inserted at the same time the visitor's browser and saved on the computer. The cookie contains a text file that collects information about the visitor's operation on the Website. Among other things, a unique identifier in the value of the cookie and this unique identifier is generated and managed by Google. When the complainant visited the Website, or a sub-page of the Website, was transmitted the following information via JavaScript code from the complainant's browser to Google LLC's servers: 1. Unique identifier(s) that identified the browser or device used to visit the Website as well as a unique identifier that identifies Coops (ie the company's Google Analytics account ID). 2. Web address (URL) and HTML title of the website and web page that the appellant has visited. 3. Information about browser, operating system, screen resolution, language setting and date and time of access to the Website. 4. The generic IP address created by Coop's implementation of a so-called server side container. During the appellant's visit (according to point 1 above) said identifier was put in cookies with the names ""\_gads"", ""\_ga"" and ""\_gid"" and subsequently transferred to Google LLC. These identifiers have been created with the aim of being able to distinguish individual visitors, such as the appellant. The unique identifiers thus make the visitors to the Website identifiable. Although such unique identifiers (as per 1 above) would not in themselves be considered make individuals identifiable, however, it must be considered that these unique identifiers in it the current case can be combined with additional elements (according to points 2-4 above) and that it is possible to draw conclusions in relation to information (according to the points 6 CJEU judgment Breyer, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraphs 45–46. 7 CJEU judgment M.I.C.M, C-597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraphs 102–104 and judgment Breyer, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph 49. 8 See the Court of Appeal in Gothenburg's judgment of 11 November 2021 in case no. 2232-21, with the agreement of the sub-instance assessment. Page 13 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 14(24) Date: 2023-06-30 2–4 above) which means that information constitutes personal data, regardless of whether the IP address is not transferred in its entirety. If information is combined (according to points 1–4 above), it means that individual visitors on The website becomes even more distinguishable. It is thus possible to identify individual visitors of the Website. That in itself is enough for it to be considered personal data. It does not require knowledge of the actual visitor's name or physical address, because the differentiation (through the word ""thinning"" in recital 26 i the data protection regulation, ""singling out"" in the English version) in itself is sufficient for to make the visitor indirectly identifiable. Nor is it required that Google or Coop have for the purpose of identifying the appellant, but the opportunity to do so is in itself sufficient for to determine whether it is possible to identify a visitor. Objective aids such as can reasonably be used either by the personal data controller or by someone other, are all aids that can reasonably be used for the purpose of identifying the appellant. Examples of objective aids that can reasonably be used are access to additional information with a third party that would make it possible to identify the complainant with taking into account both available technology at the time of identification as well as cost (the time required) for the identification. IMY states that the European Court of Justice, through the judgment M.I.C.M. and the Breyer judgment established that dynamic IP addresses constitute personal data in relation to the person who processes them, when he also has a legal opportunity to identify the holders of the internet connections using the additional information provided by third parties dispose of. IP addresses do not lose their character of being personal data alone due to the fact that the means of identification are with third parties. The Breyer ruling and The M.I.C.M judgment should be interpreted based on what is actually stated in the judgments ie. that about it there is a legal possibility to gain access to supplementary information for the purpose of identify the appellant it is objectively clear that there is a “means which reasonably can will be used' to identify the complainant. According to IMY, the judgments should not be read on the contrary, in the way that a legally regulated possibility to gain access must be demonstrated to data that can link IP addresses to natural persons so that the IP addresses will considered to be personal data. An interpretation of the concept of personal information which means that it must always be demonstrated a legal possibility to link such data to a physical person would, according to IMY, mean a significant limitation of the regulation protection area, and open up possibilities to circumvent the protection in the regulation. This one interpretation would, among other things, be contrary to the purpose of the regulation according to Article 1.2 i data protection regulation. The Breyer judgment was decided under previously applicable directives 95/46 and the concept of ""singling out"" according to recital 26 of the current regulation (that it does not knowledge of the actual visitor's name or physical address is required, because the distinction itself is sufficient to make the visitor identifiable), was not specified in previously applicable directives as a method for identifying personal data. In this context, other information is also added (according to points 1–3 above) such as IP the address can be combined with to enable identification. Coop's action regarding the generic IP address created by Coop's implementation of a so-called server side container prevents the transfer of IP address to third countries, however, is enabled still identification with Coop, which in itself is sufficient for the data together shall constitute personal data. 9 ECJ judgment M.I.C.M, C-597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraphs 102-104 and Breyer judgment, C-582/14 EU:C:2016:779, paragraph 49. Page 14 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 15(24) Date: 2023-06-30 IMY states that there may also be reasons to compare IP addresses (even generic ones) with pseudonymised personal data. Pseudonymization of personal data means, according to Article 4.5 of the data protection regulation, that the data – similar to dynamic IP addresses – cannot be directly attributed to a specific data subject without supplementary information is used. According to recital 26 of the data protection regulation should such information is considered to be information about an identifiable natural person. A narrower interpretation of the concept of personal data would undermine, according to IMY the scope of the right to the protection of personal data, which is guaranteed in Article 8 i The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, because it would make it possible for personal data controllers to specifically single out individuals together with personal data (eg when they visit a certain website) at the same time as individuals are denied the right to protection against the dissemination of such information about them. Such an interpretation would undermine the level of protection for individuals and would not be compatible with the wide scope given by the data protection rules in the practice of the EU Court of Justice. 10 In addition, the complainant's personal data was processed on August 14, 2020, by the complainant has been logged in to his Google account when visiting the Website, thereby it has been possible to draw conclusions about the individual based on his registration with Google. From Google's statement it appears that implementation of the Tool on a website makes it possible to obtain information that a user of a Google account (ie a registrant) has visited the website in question. Google does specify that certain conditions must be met for Google to be able to receive such information, e.g. that the user (complainant) has not deactivated treatment for and display of personal advertisements. Because the appellant was logged into his Google account when visiting the Website, Google may thus still have had the opportunity to obtain information about the logged-in user's visit to the Website. The fact that it does not appear from the complaint that no personal ads have been shown, does not mean that Google cannot obtain information about the logged-in user's visit to the Website. IMY finds against the background of the unique identifiers that can identify the browser or the device, the ability to derive the individual through his Google account, they the generic IP addresses as well as the possibility to combine these with additional ones information that Coop's use of the Tool on a web page means that personal data is processed. 2.3 Coop is the personal data controller for the processing Personal data controller is, among other things, a legal person who alone or together with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (Article 4.7 of the Data Protection Regulation). Personal data assistant is among another, a legal entity that processes personal data for it account of the personal data controller (Article 4.8 of the data protection regulation). The responses provided by Coop show that the company has made the decision to implement The tool on the Website. Furthermore, it appears that Coop's purpose for this was that the company must be able to analyze how the Website is used, in particular to be able to follow the use of the website over time. IMY finds that Coop by deciding to implement the Tool on the website i said purpose has established the purposes and means of the collection and it 10 See, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice Latvijas Republikas Saeima (Points de pénalité), C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph 61, judgment Nowak, C-434/16, EU:C:2017:994, paragraph 33 and judgment Rijkeboer, C-553/07, EU:C:2009:293, paragraph 59. Page 15 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 16(24) Date: 2023-06-30 the subsequent transfer of this personal data. Coop is therefore personal data controller for this processing. 2.4 Transfer of personal data to third countries The investigation shows that the data collected via the Tool is stored by Google LLC in the United States. Thus, the personal data collected via the Tool is transferred to the United States. The question is therefore whether Coop's transfer of personal data to the USA is compatible with Article 44 of the Data Protection Regulation and is supported by a transfer tool in Chapter V. 2.4.1 Applicable regulations, etc. According to article 44 of the data protection regulation, which has the title ""General principle for transfer of data"", includes the transfer of personal data that is under processing or are intended to be processed after they have been transferred to a third country - i.e. a country outside the EU/EEA - only take place under the condition that it personal data controller and the personal data assistant, subject to others provisions of the data protection regulation, meet the conditions in chapter V. All provisions of said chapter shall be applied to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons ensured by the data protection regulation is not undermined. Chapter V of the data protection regulation contains tools that can be used for transfers to third countries to ensure a level of protection essentially equivalent to that which guaranteed within the EU/EEA. It can e.g. be transfer supported by a decision on adequate level of protection (Article 45) and transfer covered by appropriate protective measures (Article 46). There are also exceptions for special situations (Article 49). In the judgment Schrems II, the Court of Justice of the European Union has annulled that decision on adequacy 11 level of protection that previously applied to the United States. Because a decision on adequate level of protection since July 2020 is missing, transfers to the US may not be based on Article 45. Article 46.1 provides, among other things, that in the absence of a decision in accordance with Article 45.3 a personal data controller or a personal data assistant may only transfer personal data to a third country after taking appropriate safeguards, and on conditions that statutory rights of registered and effective remedies for registered are available. Article 46.2 c stipulates that such suitable safeguards may take the form of standardized data protection regulations adopted by the Commission in accordance with the review procedure referred to in Article 93(2). In the judgment Schrems II, the European Court of Justice did not reject standard contract clauses which transfer tool. However, the court found that they are not binding on the authorities of the third country. The Court of Justice of the European Union stated that “\[even\] if thus there are situations where the recipient of such a transfer, depending on the legal situation and current practice in the third country concerned, can guarantee the necessary protection of data solely with the support of the standardized data protection regulations, exists the other situations in which the provisions of these clauses cannot be one sufficient means to ensure effective protection of the personal data in practice which is transferred to the third country concerned.' According to the European Court of Justice, this is ""among other things 11 Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 in accordance with the European Parliament and Council Directive 95/46/EC on whether adequate protection is ensured by the Privacy Shield in The European Union and the United States. Page 16 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 17(24) Date: 2023-06-30 the case when the legislation of the third country allows the authorities of that third country to do interference with the rights of the registered persons regarding these data.” 12 The reason why the European Court of Justice annulled the decision on adequate level of protection with the US was because of how the US intelligence services can gain access to personal data. According to the court, the conclusion of standard contract clauses cannot i ensure a level of protection required according to Article 44 of the Data Protection Regulation, as the guarantees stated therein do not apply when requested by such authorities access. The European Court of Justice therefore stated the following: ""It thus appears that the standardized data protection regulations which the commission adopted with the support of article 46.2 c of the same regulation only aims to provide the personal data controllers or their personal data assistants established in the Union contractual safeguards that are applied uniformly throughout third countries and thus independent of the level of protection ensured in each of these countries. Because these standardized data protection regulations, with regard to their nature, cannot lead to protective measures that go beyond a contractual obligation to ensure that the level of protection required under Union law is observed, it may be necessary, depending on the situation prevailing in a particular third country, for it personal data controller to take additional measures to ensure that the level of protection 13 observed"". In the European Data Protection Board's (EDPB) recommendations on the consequences of the judgment clarifies that if the assessment of legislation and practice in the third country involves that the protection that the transmission tool is supposed to guarantee cannot be maintained in practice the exporter must, within the framework of his transfer, as a rule either cancel the transfer or take appropriate additional protective measures. The EDPB thereby notes that ""further measures can only be considered effective in the sense referred to in the EU the court's judgment ""Schrems II"" if and to the extent that they - alone or in combination - addresses the specific deficiencies identified during the assessment of the situation i 15 the third country in terms of its laws and practices applicable to the transfer”. It appears from the EDPB's recommendations that such additional protective measures can fall into three categories: contractual, organizational and technical. 16 Regarding contractual measures, the EDPB states that such measures “\[...\] can supplement and reinforce the safeguards that the transfer tool and relevant legislation in the third country provides \[...\]. Considering that the contractual the measures are of such a nature that they cannot generally bind the authorities in it the third country because they are not parties to the agreement, these measures may often be necessary combined with other technical and organizational measures to provide it level of data protection required \[...\]'. 17 Regarding organizational measures, the EDPB emphasizes “\[a\]t choose and implement a or more of these measures will not necessarily and systematically ensure that \[a\] transfer meets the basic equivalence standard which 12 Paragraphs 125-126. 13 Item 133, IMY's. 14EDPB, Recommendations 01/2020 on measures that supplement transfer tools to ensure compliance with the EU level of protection of personal data, Version 2.0, adopted on 18 June 2021 (hereinafter ""EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020”). 15 16EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 75. IMY's translation. 17 EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 52. EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 99; IMY's translation. Page 17 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 18(24) Date: 2023-06-30 required by EU legislation. Depending on the particular circumstances surrounding the transfer and the assessment made by the law of the third country is required organizational measures to supplement contractual and/or technical measures to ensure a level of protection for personal data that is substantially equivalent to that which is guaranteed within the EU/EEA”. 18 Regarding technical measures, the EDPB points out that “these measures will in particular be necessary when the legislation of that country imposes obligations on the importer which contravenes the guarantees in Article 46 of the Data Protection Regulation transfer tools and which in particular may infringe upon the contractual guarantee of one in all essentials equivalent protection against the authorities of the third country gaining access to these tasks"". The EDPB thereby states that ""the measures specified \[in the Recommendations\] are intended to ensure that access to the transmitted data for public authorities in third countries do not interfere with the expediency of the appropriate the safeguards in Article 46 of the Data Protection Regulation transfer tool. These measures would be necessary to guarantee a substantially equivalent level of protection as that guaranteed within the EU/EEA, even if the public ones access by the authorities is consistent with the legislation of the importer's country, where such access in practice goes beyond what is necessary and proportionate in one democratic society. The purpose of these measures is to prevent potentially unauthorized access by preventing the authorities from identifying the registered, drag conclusions about them, point them out in another context or connect the transmitted ones the data to other data sets which, among other things, may contain network identifiers such as provided by the devices, applications, tools and protocols used by 20 registered in other contexts"". 2.4.2 The Privacy Protection Authority's assessment 2.4.2.1 Applicable Transfer Tool The investigation shows that Coop and Google have entered into standardized agreements data protection regulations (standard contract clauses) in the sense referred to in Article 46 for the transfer of personal data to the United States. These clauses are in line with those which published by the European Commission decision of 4 June 2021 (2021/914/EU) and thus a transfer tool according to chapter V of the data protection regulation. 2.4.2.2. The legislation and the situation in the third country As can be seen from the judgment Schrems II, the use of standard contract clauses may require additional protective measures as a complement. Therefore, an analysis of the legislation in the relevant third country is made. However, IMY believes that the analysis that the EU Court has already made in the judgment Schrems II, which refers to similar conditions, is relevant and up-to-date, and that it can therefore be added as a basis for the assessment in the case without any further analysis of it the legal situation in the United States needs to be done. Namely, Google LLC, as the importer of the data to the United States, must be classified as a provider of electronic communication services in the sense referred to in 50 US Code § 1881 (b)(4). Google is therefore subject to surveillance by American intelligence services in accordance with 50 US § 1881a (“702 FISA”) and thus liable to provide the US government with personal data when 702 FISA is used. 18EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 128; IMY's translation. 19EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 77; IMY's translation. 20EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 79; IMY's translation Page 18 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 19(24) Date: 2023-06-30 The EU Court stated in the judgment Schrems II that the American surveillance programs based on 702 FISA, Executive Order 12333 (hereinafter “E.O. 12333”) and Presidential Policy Directive 28 (hereinafter “PPD-28”) in the American legislation does not correspond to the minimum requirements that apply in EU law according to the principle of proportionality. This means that the monitoring programs that are established on these provisions cannot be considered to be limited to what is strict necessary. The court also found that the monitoring programs do not provide the registered rights enforceable against US authorities i court, which means that these people do not have the right to an effective remedy. Against this background, IMY notes that the use of the EU Commission's standard contract clauses are not in themselves sufficient to achieve an acceptable level of protection for the transferred personal data. 2.4.2.3 Additional protective measures implemented by Google and Coop The next question is whether Coop has taken sufficient additional protective measures. As a personal data controller and exporter of the personal data, Coop is obliged to see to ensure that the rules in the data protection regulation are complied with. This responsibility includes, among other things, that i each individual case in the case of transfers of personal data to third countries assess which additional safeguards to be used and to what extent, including that evaluate if the actions taken by the recipient (Google) and the exporter (Coop) taken together are sufficient to achieve an acceptable level of protection. 2.4.2.3.1 Google's additional safeguards Google LLC, as an importer of personal data, has taken contractual, organizational and technical measures to complement the standard contract clauses. Google has described these measures in its statement on April 9, 2021. The question is about the additional protective measures taken by the company and Google LLC are effective, in other words hindering US intelligence agencies' ability to access the transferred personal data. With regard to the contractual and organizational measures, it can be stated that neither information to users of the Tool (such as Coop), the publication of a transparency report or a publicly available “Government Request Handling Policy” impedes or reduces the ability of US intelligence agencies to obtain access to the personal data. Furthermore, it is unclear how Google LLC's “thorough examination of each request” on the “legality” of such requests is effective as additional safeguard, taking into account that also legitimate legal requests from American intelligence services, according to the European Court of Justice, are not compatible with the requirements of EU data protection rules. Regarding the technical measures taken, it can be stated that neither Google The LLC or the company has clarified how the described measures – such as protection of communication between Google services, protection of data during transfer between data center, protection of communications between users and websites or “physical security” – hinders or reduces the ability of US intelligence agencies to prepare access to the data with the support of the US regulations. 2Items 184 and 192. Item 259 et seq. 2Regardless of whether such notification would even be permitted under US law. Page 19 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 20(24) Date: 2023-06-30 When it comes to encryption technology – e.g. for so-called ""data at rest"" in data centers, which Google LLC mentions as a technical measure – has Google LLC as an importer of personal data nevertheless an obligation to grant access to or hand over imported personal data held by Google LLC, including any encryption keys which is required to make the data comprehensible. Thus, such a technical measure can is not considered effective as long as Google LLC has the ability to access the personal data in plain text. Regarding what Google LLC's stated that ""to the extent information for measurement i Google Analytics transmitted by website owners constitutes personal data, they receive considered to be pseudonymized” it can be stated that universal unique identifiers (UUID) is not covered by the concept of pseudonymisation in Article 4.5 i data protection regulation. Pseudonymization can be a privacy-enhancing technique, but the unique identifiers, as described above, have the specific purpose of distinguishing user and not to act as protection. In addition, individual identifiable genomes are made what is stated above about the possibility of combining unique identifiers and others data (eg metadata from browsers or devices and the IP address) and the ability to link such information to a Google account for logged-in users. 24 Regarding Google's action ""anonymization of IP addresses"" in the form of truncation it is not clear from Google's response if this action takes place before the transfer, or if the entire IP address is transferred to the USA and shortened only after the transfer to the USA. From from a technical point of view, it has thus not been shown that there is no potential access to the whole The IP address before the last octet is truncated. Against this background, IMY notes that the additional protective measures taken of Google are not effective, because they do not prevent American intelligence services' ability to access the personal data or does so access ineffective. 2.4.2.3.2 Coop's own additional protective measures Coop has stated that the company has taken additional protective measures in addition to those measures which Google (truncation of the last octet when transmitting measured data) has taken. According to the company, these consist of a so-called server side container, set up for the purpose of extend control over how data is sent to the Tool and means that it is only one and the same generic IP address transmitted to the Tool, regardless which the data subject's unique IP address is. However, IMY finds that these measures are not sufficient for the following reasons. IMY states that Coop also transmits a number of other unique identifiers (clientID, userID, gclid and dclid as well as transactionID), the purpose of which is to be able to distinguish it Complainant at Google. The so-called server side container means that IP number, after that The IP address that has been collected by Coop (but before the transfer to Google), replaced with a generic IP number that is the same for all visitors to Coop's website. The 23 See EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 81. 24 IP address truncation means that asterisks or zeros replace other digits in the last octets (the last digits of an IP 25ress, a number between 0 and 255). IP address truncation means that asterisks or zeros replace other digits in the last octets (the last digits of an IP address, a number between 0 and 255), which itself can only be one of 256 options. The effect of this action means that it is still possible to distinguish the IP address from the other IP addresses (255 options), because the IP the address can be linked with other transferred data (e.g. information about unit and time of visit) to third country. Masking of the last octet (Google's action) is not an additional privacy-enhancing action other than server side container, as this action only masks the last octet of an already anonymized IP address. Page 20 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 21(24) Date: 2023-06-30 the unique identifiers (clientID, userID, gclid and dclid and transactionID) are also transmitted via so-called server side container (and the IP anonymization), but is transmitted unchanged form ie in plain text, which means that these data can be separated and thus can are connected. IMY states, because it is possible to connect the transferred ones the data to other data that is also transferred to Google LLC, that they further the protective measures are not sufficient. To ensure effective safeguards, all unique identifiers should be transmitted instead in altered form (i.e. not in plain text) which means that transmitted data cannot be accessed connect. Against this background, IMY notes that neither the additional measures which taken by the company, in addition to the additional measures taken by Google, is sufficient effective in preventing US intelligence agencies from accessing the personal data or render such access ineffective. 2.4.2.3.3 The Privacy Protection Authority's conclusion In light of the above, IMY finds that Coop has not demonstrated that any of the tools listed in Chapter V of the Data Protection Regulation can be used to transfer personal data about visitors to its website - in particular unique identifiers, IP- addresses, browser data and metadata - to Google LLC in the USA. With this transfer of data, Coop is therefore undermining the level of protection for personal data of data subjects guaranteed in Article 44 of the Data Protection Regulation. IMY therefore states that Coop Sverige AB is in breach of Article 44 i data protection regulation. 3 Choice of intervention 3.1 Legal regulation In the event of violations of the data protection regulation, IMY has a number of corrective measures powers to be available according to Article 58.2 a–j of the data protection regulation, among other things reprimand, injunction and penalty fees. IMY shall impose penalty fees in addition to or in lieu of other corrective measures as referred to in Article 58(2), depending on the circumstances of each individual case. Each supervisory authority must ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty charges in each individual case are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The stated in Article 83.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. In article 83.2 of the data protection regulation, the factors that must be considered in order to decide whether an administrative penalty fee should be imposed, but also at the determination of the amount of the penalty fee. If it is a question of a smaller one breach will receive the IMY as set out in recital 148 instead of imposing a penalty fee issue a reprimand according to article 58.2 b of the regulation. Consideration shall in the assessment, aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the case are taken into account, such as the nature, severity and duration of the breach and previous breaches of relevance. Page 21 of 24The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11368 22(24) Date: 2023-06-30 According to article 83.5 c of the data protection regulation, in the event of a violation of among article 44 in accordance with 83.2 administrative penalty fees of up to 20 million are imposed EUR or, in the case of a company, of up to 4% of the total global the annual turnover during the previous budget year, depending on which value is the highest. 3.2 Should a penalty fee be imposed? IMY has found above that the transfers of personal data to the USA that take place via The Google Analytics tool and which Coop is responsible for contravenes Article 44 i data protection regulation. Violations of that provision may, as stated above, incur penalty charges. In the current case, it is a question of a serious one violation which should normally result in a penalty fee. When assessing in this case whether a penalty fee should be imposed, it must be in the aggravating direction it is taken into account that the infringement has occurred by Coop transferring a large amount personal data to third countries where the data cannot be guaranteed the level of protection that given in the EU/EEA. The treatment has taken place systematically and over a long period of time. After The European Court of Justice, by judgment on 16 July 2020, rejected the Commission's decision on adequate level of protection in the USA changed the conditions for transfers of personal data to the United States. About 3 years have now passed since the judgment was announced and In the meantime, the EDPB has made recommendations on the consequences of the judgment for public consultation on 10 November 2020 and in final form on 18 June 2021. In the mitigating direction, the special situation that arose after must be taken into account the judgment and the interpretation of the EDPB's recommendations, where there was a gap after that the transfer tool to the USA according to the Commission's previous decision was rejected by European Court of Justice. In addition, it must be taken into account that it appears from the investigation that Coop has made an analysis of the life cycle of personal data in the Tool. Coop has also taken measures such as a so-called server side container, set up to extend control over how data is sent to the Tool and which means that there is only one and the same generic IP address that is transmitted to the Tool, regardless of which one registrant's unique IP address is. The company has also activated Google's action ""anonymization of IP addresses"" through truncation. Coop has thus taken comprehensive technical measures to try to limit the risks for the data subjects and to heal the defects. Coop has thereby also believed that they succeeded even though the measures now proved not to be effective enough to prevent American intelligence agencies' ability to access the data or to do so access ineffective. In a balanced assessment, IMY finds that there is reason to in this case refrain from imposing a penalty fee on Coop for the established violation and stop at an injunction to remedy the deficiency. 3.3 Other interventions It appears from the investigation that the protective measures for the transfer of personal data as invoked by Coop cannot support the transfer according to Chapter V i data protection regulation. The transfer thus involves a violation of the regulation. In order to ensure that the infringement ceases, Coop must be served in accordance with article 58.2 d of the data protection regulation to ensure that the company's processing of 27 Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 according to the European Parliament and the Council directive 95/46/EC on whether adequate protection is ensured by the privacy shield in the EU and the United the states.

The Privacy Protection Authority orders Dagens Industri Aktiebolag with the support of article 58.2 d of the data protection regulation to ensure that the company's processing of personal data within the framework of Dagens Industri's use of the Google tool Analytics complies with Article 44 and other provisions of Chapter V. This shall in particular be done by Dagens Industri Aktiebolag ceasing to use it version of the Google Analytics tool used on August 14, 2020, if not sufficient protective measures have been taken. The measures must be completed no later than month after this decision became final. 1 Description of the supervisory matter 1.1 The processing The Swedish Privacy Protection Agency (IMY) has started supervision of Dagens Industri Limited company (hereinafter ""Dagens Industri"" or ""the company"") due to a complaint. The complaint concerns an alleged violation of the provisions of Chapter V i data protection regulation linked to the transfer of the complainant's personal data to third country. The transfer allegedly took place when the complainant visited the company's website, www.di.se (hereinafter ""the company's website"" or the ""Website"") through the Google tool Analytics (hereinafter the “Tool”) provided by Google LLC. The complaint has been handed over to IMY, in its capacity as the responsible supervisory authority according to Article 56 of the Data Protection Regulation. The handover has taken place from the supervisory authority in the country where the complainant has filed his complaint (Austria) in accordance with the regulation's provisions on cooperation in cross-border processing. The proceedings at IMY have taken place through an exchange of letters. Against the background that it applies cross-border treatment, IMY has used the mechanisms for cooperation and uniformity found in Chapter VII of the Data Protection Regulation. Concerned regulatory authorities have been the authorities in Germany, Norway, Denmark, Estonia and Portugal. 1.2 What is stated in the complaint The complaint essentially states the following. On August 14, 2020, the complainant visited Dagens Industri's website. During the visit the appellant was logged into his Google account, which is linked to the appellant's e- mailing address. The company had implemented a Javascript code on its website for Google services, including Google Analytics. In accordance with clause 5.1.1 b of the terms of 1 regarding the processing of personal data and about the free flow of such data and about the cancellation of aver med directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). Page 3 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 4(27) Date: 2023-06-30 Google's processing of personal data for Google's advertising products and also Google's terms for processing ""the New Order Data Processing Conditions for Google Advertising Products” Google processes personal data for it the personal data controller's (i.e. the company's) account. Google LLC shall therefore according to above said conditions are classified as the company's personal data assistant. During the complainant's visit to the company's website, the complainant was treated personal data of Dagens Industri, at least the complainant's IP address and data collected through cookies. Some of the data collected was transferred directly to Google. In accordance with clause 10 of the terms and conditions for the processing of personal data for Google's advertising products, Dagens Industri has approved that Google may process personal information about the complainant in the United States. Such transfer of data requires legal support in accordance with chapter V of the data protection regulation. According to the judgment of the European Court of Justice Facebook Ireland and Schrems (Schrems II), 2 the company can no longer rely on a decision on an adequate level of protection for the transfer of data to the United States according to Article 45 of the Data Protection Regulation. The company should not base the transfer of data on standardized data protection regulations according to article 46.2 c of the data protection regulation if the recipient country does not ensure adequate protection with regard to Union law for the personal data that is transferred. Google shall be classified as a provider of electronic communications services in it meaning referred to in 50 US Code § 1881 (4)(b) and is thus subject to surveillance by US intelligence agencies in accordance with 50 US § 1881a (section 702 i Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, hereinafter “702 FISA”). Google provides it US government with personal data in accordance with these regulations. The company cannot therefore ensure adequate protection of the complainant's personal data when these are transferred to Google. 1.3 What Dagens Industri has stated Dagens Industri Aktiebolag has essentially stated the following. 1.3.1 Who has implemented the Tool and for what purpose, etc. Dagens Industri has made the decision to implement the Tool on the Website, which has taken place by embedding the code for the Tool on the Website. The tool is still active. The company is established in Sweden and has not made such a decision for any other European website. The purpose of embedding the code for the Tool on the Website is that Dagens Industri should be able to analyze how the Website is used, in particular to be able to follow the use of the Website over time. The website is aimed at Swedish visitors, but it cannot be ruled out that individuals from other countries have visited the Website and thus can be covered by the statistics. 2 ECJ judgment Facebook Ireland and Schrems (Schrems II), C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559. 3See https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/html/USCODE-2011-title50-chap36-subchapVI- sec1881.htm and https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/html/USCODE-2011-title50-chap36- subchapVI-sec1881a.htm. Page 4 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 5(27) Date: 2023-06-30 The data (including any personal data) that is transferred to the Tool may come to be stored on servers in various countries, including the United States. As a user of the Tool, it works not to control which servers are used to store data in the Tool. 1.3.2 Recipient of the data Within the framework of Dagens Industri's use of the Tool on the Website is provided personal data out to a number of actors, all of whom are personal data processors or subcontractors to Dagens Industri, including Google LLC, Google Ireland Ltd and their assistants. 1.3.3 The data processed in the Tool and what constitutes it personal data Within the framework of Dagens Industri's use of the Tool on the Website processes the company and its personal data assistants (the Recipients) the information specified below. • Page view data – for example URL, clicks in menus, articles visited, reading time and how long the visitor watches a video. • Technical information about device – for example, cookie value (which is hashat before it is transferred to the Tool, but was not hashed when the complainant visited The website), operating system and screen size. • User category – for example, a flag that shows whether the visitor is 4 subscriber or not. • So-called ""own dimensions"" – for example which version of publishing platform on which a page view occurred, information about the article (for example, authors). • IP addresses – IP addresses are processed partly when the Google Analytics measurement script is read in, partly when measured data is to be transferred to the Tool. The IP address which is processed together with measured data (page view data etc.) is anonymized through the company's proprietary process and which managed on an EU-based infrastructure before being shipped together with the measured data to the Tool (see more about this below). Dagens Industri assesses that the categories Page view data, Technical information about device, User category and ""own dimensions"" can be considered as personal data only in cases where the company can link this data to an individual through supplementary information that the company has in other systems, which is not always the case. Dagens Industri regards IP addresses as personal data until these is anonymized. 1.3.4 Categories of persons affected by the processing The categories of persons affected by the processing are visitors to the Website. It can be Dagens Industri's paying subscribers or visitors without a digital one account. Information about particularly vulnerable persons is not processed. The site is aimed at first hand to adults in their professional role or who have an interest in economics and business life issues. It is not aimed at children or other particularly vulnerable groups. 1.3.5 When the code for the Tool is executed and recipients are provided access The code for the Tool's content, i.e. the script that measures the data sent to The tool is only run if the visitor has given his consent to Dagens Industri 4Note that identifying information such as the actual subscription ID is not transferred, but only a value such as represents the category ""subscriber"" or ""not subscriber"" (1 or 0). Page 5 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 6(27) Date: 2023-06-30 uses analysis cookies on the Website. If the visitor has given their consent the data measured by the script will first be sent to Dagens Industris proxy server, where the majority of security-enhancing measures are implemented, for example anonymization of IP address. A subset of the measured data is then transmitted encrypted from the proxy server to the Tool provided by Google (see below). Google LLC, Google Ireland and other personal data agents and sub-agents may access to the pseudonymised data stored in the Tool to the extent that required for the personal data assistant or sub-assistant to be able to perform the service, including support and troubleshooting services. 1.3.6 How long the personal data is stored The data measured on the Website and transferred to the Tool is saved in The tool for 26 months and is then deleted. Dagens Industri saves the data to be able to analyze the use of the Website over time, specifically to be able to make annual comparisons and thereby analyze how usage changes. Dagens Industri has judged that it is necessary to be able to compare in any case the use over two annual cycles. To be able to analyze and produce statistics on these changes, the company needs to save the measured data for 26 months. 1.3.7 In which countries the personal data is processed The data transferred to the Tool is stored, among other things, in the United States. 1.3.8 Dagens Industri's relationship to Google LLC The tool is provided through an agreement between Dagens Industri and a Swedish limited company (hereinafter the ""Supplier""). Google Ireland Ltd is in turn a subcontractor to the supplier. Dagens Industri has entered into a personal data processing agreement with the supplier, which regulates The supplier's and its subcontractors' personal data processing. Because the purposes and means of the processing in their entirety are determined by Dagens Industri is Google LLC and Google Ireland Ltd personal data assistants for it personal data processing that becomes relevant in relation to the Tool. Dagens Industri has also entered into a personal data processing agreement directly with Google LLC to meet the formal requirements of the standard contract clauses, ie. that these must be formally entered into directly between the person in charge of personal data and counsel in a third country. 1.3.9 Ensuring that the processing does not take place for the recipients' own purposes 1.3.9.1 General Dagens Industri cares about only hiring such suppliers who can fulfill the company's high requirements for secure and legal processing of personal data. Before a certain supplier is selected, an assessment is made of the supplier's ability to maintain an acceptable level of security, including protecting personal data that shall treated. Dagens Industri has also worked out an audit plan where the company intends to carry out audits of the most important suppliers, based on a rolling schedule. Dagens Industri also conducts a continuous dialogue with Google, where security and data protection issues are discussed. 1.3.9.2 Agreement with the Supplier Through the assistance agreement with the Supplier and the documented instructions which left from Dagens Industri in this regard, it has been contractually ensured that The supplier and its subcontractors do not process personal data for their own or Page 6 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 7(27) Date: 2023-06-30 third party purposes. The assistance agreement thus contains special provisions (section 3.2.1) that the Supplier may only process personal data in accordance with Dagens Industri's documented instructions. In Appendix 2 to the assistance agreement is made clear that the Supplier is under no circumstances entitled to process personal data for own purposes. As an incentive to comply with the requirements set according to the assistance agreement and to emphasize its importance, the Supplier has a compensation obligation towards Dagens Industry if the Supplier were to breach the agreement or applicable data protection legislation and this causes damage to Dagens Industri. The assistance agreement with the Supplier also enables Dagens Industri to request documentation and conduct audits of systems and procedures to ensure that the processing takes place in accordance with Dagens Industri's documented instructions and applicable data protection legislation. In the event that Dagens Industri has reason to assume that the Supplier does not comply with the requirements that is stated in the assistance agreement, Dagens Industri intends to carry out one audit. The supplier also has the right to request documentation and implement audits in relation to Google (Section 7.5 of the Google Assistant Agreement). Dagens Industri can also request an audit of Google's system and procedures in accordance with the assistance agreement with the Supplier (section 8.5). 1.3.10 Description of Dagens Industri's use of the Tool Dagens Industri uses the Tool to collect quantitative data, web statistics, about how the Website is used, and make analyzes based on this data. Web statistics can, for example, show which pages are most visited, which way visitors take through the Website, and from which pages visitors leave the Website. Web analytics can also provide insight into the frequency of visits and which content is visited the longest time. The analysis carried out with the help of the Tool can, for example, form the basis for product improvements. 1.3.11 Own checks on transfers affected by the Schrems II judgment After the judgment Schrems II was published on July 16, 2020, Dagens Industri began during the end of July 2020 a project to generally map transfers of personal data to third countries. The project did not refer to the Tool specifically but applied third country transfers in general. In connection with Dagens Industri becoming known about, among other things, the current complaint, on 18 August 2020 a project was launched which specifically related to the use of the Tool. Relatively immediately after the verdict, could the company states that it is relevant for the data transfer that takes place within the framework of Verktyget and Dagens Industri have subsequently taken relevant protective measures, see below. 1.3.12 Transfer tool according to chapter V of the data protection regulation Dagens Industri has entered into a personal data processing agreement directly with Google LLC. Google's standard contractual clauses are part of the assistant agreement. Of the assistance agreement it appears that Google is bound by the clauses (clause 10.2). The clauses are based on Commission Decision 2010/87/EU for transfers from a personal data controller within the EU/EEA to a personal data processor outside the EU/EEA. These terms and conditions apply automatically at the conclusion of Google's personal data processing agreement and needs thus not being signed separately to be applicable. It is clear from the preamble to Page 7 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 8(27) Date: 2023-06-30 Google Standard Terms of Agreement. According to Swedish law, which shall be applied to the standard contract clauses, this means that these become part of the contract. Google's standard contractual clauses also form part of the personal data processor agreement with The Supplier in accordance with Appendix 2 of the assistance agreement with the Supplier. Dagens Industri has also entered into a personal data processing agreement with the Supplier, there Google Ireland Ltd acts as sub-agent and which in turn has certain sub-agents in third country. This agreement also applies Google's standard agreement clauses such as transfer tool. 1.3.13 Control of obstacles to enforcement in legislation in third countries Dagens Industri has not yet been able to ascertain with certainty whether there is anything in it third country legislation that prohibits the recipients from fulfilling their contractual obligations according to the standard contract clauses. The company has therefore, for preventive purposes, assumed that this is the case and has taken special technical protective measures to ensure that the protection for the data processed in the Tool achieves an acceptable level. 1.3.14 Additional safeguards taken in addition to those taken by Google 1.3.14.1 Introduction Dagens Industri has carried out a detailed mapping of the life cycle of personal data that is processed in the Tool, and has thereby identified and implemented one number of additional protective measures. The measures are visualized in an overview in the image below, and is further commented on in subsequent sections. 1.3.14.2 Control over collection and transfer of data to the Tool A common way of using the Tool, if not additional protective measures are taken, means that the data measured via the Website's measurement script is transmitted directly to the Tool's servers, without first going through a checkpoint with it personal data controller using the tool. Page 8 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 9(27) Date: 2023-06-30 Because the Tool's servers can be located inside and outside the EU/EEA, use of The tool leads to measured data being transferred to third countries. In the Tool there is a function which means that users of the Tool can choose to anonymize the IP address 5 (truncation) which is transmitted together with the measured data. Because the anonymization takes place only after the IP address is transferred to the Google Analytics servers occurs according to Dagens Industri a third country transfer before the anonymization takes place. Dagens Industri has taken protective measures before data is transferred to the Tool. To take control over which data is transferred to the Tool's servers outside the EU/EEA the company has implemented technical measures which mean that the data collected via Google Analytics measurement script on the Website in a first step is transferred to a proxy server located within the EU where the data is processed to avoid that they can be used to identify an individual thereafter. The software used has been developed and is owned by Dagens Industri, and is hosted (housed) by Google Ireland Ltd as a part of Google Cloud Platform (""GCP""). The GCP is thus only used as a rental infrastructure to run the proxy server's code on. The data processed on GCP takes place exclusively at data centers within the EU. Dagens Industri is responsible for personal data for the processing that takes place in the proxy server. By Dagens Industri having introduced this control point, the company can ensure that no data is transferred to servers outside the EU/EEA without first having undergone protection actions (see further below). Transmission to the proxy server is encrypted with Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”), a technology that enables encrypted communication between a browser and a server). 1.3.14.3 Anonymization of IP address and algorithm The information that can in some cases be linked to an individual and that is transferred from Web- the location of the proxy server is IP address and cookie value. The examples below illustrate how these numbers can look like before and after they are processed on the proxy server. Before processing on proxy server: Tasks • IP address: plain text, e.g. 176.10.253.34 • Cookie value: plain text, e.g. 744100309.1604572939 Before the measured data is transferred to the Tool, the following is carried out on the proxy server: • Anonymization of IP address. The visitor's IP address is anonymized by generalization and aggregation where the last octet of the IPv4 address is replaced by "".0"". • Hashing of the cookie value. The cookie value measured on The website can either be completely anonymous (when the company cannot connect the cookie value to data in their other systems) or constitute a pseudonymised personal data (when the company can connect the cookie value to data in their other systems). As an additional protective measure before transmission takes place to the Tool, the cookie value is hashed from the visitor's client 6 with a ""salt"". The hashing of the cookie value constitutes an additional protection against 5 IP address truncation means that asterisks or zeros replace other digits in the last octets (the last digits of an IP address, a number between 0 and 255). 6 See information on ""Keyed-hash function with stored key"" in the Article 29 Group's guidance on anonymization techniques. Page 9 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 10(27) Date: 2023-06-30 the risk that US authorities may connect ""intercepted data"" (ie data which could possibly be read by signals intelligence software either ""at rest"" in the Tool or ""in transfer"") with identifying data which US authorities could potentially gain access to another way. After the actions described above have been carried out, the IP address and the cookie value can for example, look like the following: Tasks • IP address: anonymized, e.g. 176.10.253.00 • Cookie value: hashed, e.g. 35009a79-1a05-49d7-b876-2b884d0f825b The transfer of the data then takes place via SSL encryption from the proxy server to The tool. Anonymization of the visitor's IP address takes place when this is to be transferred together with the measured page view data etc. (see above for which data points are measured). Prior to this, the IP address has been exposed to the Tool on that occasion by Google Analytics measurement script via encrypted transmission was loaded into the visitor's browser from The tool's server. It is not possible to associate the IP address with the page view data etc. which are measured at a later time on the Website. Today's Industry has therefore assessed that this exposure of the IP address does not pose any privacy risk to visitors to the Website. Regarding the time of visit to the Website, Google LLC may indirectly infer the time of the visit, but this possibility is very limited. Google has configured the server on which 'analytics.js' is provided so that the JavaScript file cached in the receiving terminal's application cache for two hours, regardless of which website it is first obtained through (i.e. not necessarily on the Website). During this time period, no more calls are made where the IP address is exposed in its entirety, which means that the measured page view data transmitted via Dagens Industris proxy server to Google LLC (first transfer) very rarely has a temporal the corresponding machine log of Google LLC linked to the transmission via 'analytics.js' (second transfer). In combination with the fact that visitors most often use the Website as source of information at work and/or during the previous two hours visited another website using Google Analytics (most likely given that about 74% of the world's 10,000 most popular websites present) means that a large proportion of the visits to the Website only result in transmitted page view data from Dagens Industri's proxy server and no loading of the Tool with associated transfer of IP address. This greatly hinders any attempts to connect machine logs from transmission of the Tool and transmitted page view data from Dagens industry's proxy server and reduces according to Dagen according to risk to beyond “reasonable probability"". Page 10 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 11(27) Date: 2023-06-30 1.3.14.4 More about checking that additional measures can be implemented in practice, etc. Dagens Industri's considerations regarding the measures the company has implemented are based on the EDPB's recommendations on how individual third country transfers must be assessed based on its specific legal context (point 33). 7 The security-enhancing measures mainly consist of the responsibility for and the control that Dagens Industri has taken over the phases of the life cycle before the transfer of the data takes place to the Tool. The risk assessment has had as its starting point the protection of those registered best achieved by the fact that the data transferred outside the EU/EEA is disconnected from the data subject and his technical device used to visit the Website, and that the company controls the process that ensures that these measures are carried out. 1.3.14.5 Dagens Industri's conclusion of a sufficient level of security protection Taking into account the implemented measures, Dagens Industri assesses that the risk of that the privacy or rights of the data subjects would be violated through the use of The tool is very small. The company's overall assessment is thus that a sufficient level of protection is achieved through the implemented measures. 1.3.15 Dagens Industri's assessment and conclusion regarding whether the data can are considered identifiable 1.3.15.1 The company's assessment regarding whether the data can be considered identifiable Dagens Industri believes that it is not obvious that an assessment leads to the data in question – IP address, certain system information and visited web address – constitute personal data. Recital 26 of the data protection regulation states, among other things, the following: ""To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, one should take into account all the aids, like for example. thinning out, such as, either by the data controller or by another person, can reasonably be used to directly or indirectly identify him physical person. To determine whether aids are reasonably likely to arrive to identify the natural person, one should take into account all objective factors, such as costs and time required for identification, taking into account available technology at the timing of the treatment as the technological development.” 8 The Article 29 working group has in its guidance on the concept of personal data further specified how the assessment should proceed: Recital 26 of Directive 95/46 (repealed) pays particular attention to the term ""identifiable"" when it says that ""to determine whether a person is identifiable should consider taken to any means that can reasonably be used either by the personal data controller or by any other person to identify the person”. This means that a clean hypothetical possibility of pointing out the individual is not sufficient to consider the person as ""identifiable"". If this possibility, taking into account “all means that reasonably may be used by the person in charge of personal data or any other person"", does not exist or is negligible, the person should not be considered ""identifiable"", and the information would not be considered ""personal data"". The criterion ""all means which 7EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020 on measures to complement transfer tools to ensure compliance with the EU level for the protection of personal data Version 2.0 Adopted on 18 June 2021 8WP 136.

The cost of conducting identification is a factor, but not the only one\[a\]. \[If the data is intended to be stored for one month, identification cannot be expected possible during the ""lifetime"" of the information and they should not be considered as personal data."" 10 Furthermore, the guidance states the following: ""A relevant factor, as mentioned earlier, in assessing ""all means that reasonably can will be used' to identify the persons will in fact be purposes that the data controller pursues when processing data."" 11 1.3.15.2 The company's conclusion regarding whether the data can be considered identifiable Dagens Industri has concluded that for it to be a question of personal data according to the Data Protection Regulation, the assessment of whether individuals are identifiable must based on all the relevant circumstances and assess the reasonable probability of identification, of which the purpose of the treatment is a circumstance. Because the purpose of The treatment is not to identify individuals, technical protection measures constitute an extra important factor in the assessment of whether individuals can be identified. Dagens Industri comes to the conclusion against this background that it is not obvious that a assessment in accordance with the Article 29 Group's guidance leads to the data in question – IP address, certain system information and web address visited – constitutes personal data. The assessment that individuals are not identifiable has been made with consideration of them circumstances that appear from i.e. (i) the cost of identification, (ii) the purpose of the treatment, (iii) how the treatment is structured, (iv) the benefits that it the personal data controller expects with the processing, (v) which interests stand at stake for the natural person, as well as (vi) the duration of the treatment. the purpose with the processing is not to identify individuals, but constitutes technical protection measures. It is according to Dagens Industri, it is not at all obvious that an assessment in accordance with the guidance leads to the data in question – IP address, certain system information and visited web address – constitutes personal data. 1.4 What Google LLC has stated IMY has added to the case an opinion from Google LLC (Google) on April 9, 2021 which Google submitted to the Austrian supervisory authority. The statement answers questions which the IMY and a number of supervisory authorities have asked Google due to in part joint handling of similar complaints received by these authorities. Dagens Industri has been given the opportunity to comment on Google LLC's statement. Of Google LLC's opinion states the following about the Tool. A JavaScript code is included on a web page. When a user visits (calls) a web page, the code triggers a download of a JavaScript file. Then performed the tracking operation of the Tool, which consists of collecting information related to to the call in different ways and sends the information to the Tool's servers. 10WP 136.

Article 29 Working Party Opinion 4/2007 on the concept of personal data, adopted on 20 June 2007, page 16 and 17. Page 12 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 13(27) Date: 2023-06-30 A website administrator who has integrated the Tool on his website can send instructions to Google for processing the data collected. These instructions are transmitted via the so-called tag manager that handles it tracking code that the webmaster has integrated into his website and via tag manager settings. Whoever integrated the Tool can do different things settings, for example regarding storage time. The tool also makes it possible for it which integrated it to monitor and maintain the stability of its website, for example by staying informed about events such as peaks in visitor traffic or lack of traffic. The tool also enables a website administrator to measure and optimize the effectiveness of advertising campaigns carried out using other tools from Google. In this context, the Tool collects the visitor's http calls and information about including the visitor's browser and operating system. According to Google, contains one http calls for any page information about the browser and device making the call, such as domain name, and information about the browser, such as type, reference and language. The tool stores and reads cookies in the visitor's browser in order to evaluate the visitor's session and other information about the call. Through these cookies enable the Tool to identify unique users (UUID) over browsing sessions, but the Tool cannot identify unique users in different browsers or units. If a website owner's website has its own authentication system can the website owner use the ID feature, to more accurately identify one users on all the devices and browsers they use to access the website. When the information is collected, it is transferred to the Tool's servers. All data that collected via The tool is stored in the United States. Google has introduced, among other things, the following legal, organizational and technical protective measures to regulate data transfers within the framework of the Tool. Google has taken legal and organizational protective measures such that the company always carry out a thorough examination of a request for access from government authorities on user data can be implemented. It is lawyers/specially trained staff conducting these trials and investigating whether such a request is compliant with applicable laws and Google's guidelines. Those registered are informed the disclosure, unless prohibited by law or would adversely affect one emergency. Google has also published a policy on the company's website about how a such requests for access by governmental authorities of user data shall be implemented. Google has taken technical protective measures such as protecting personal data from interception when transferring data in the Tool. By default using HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which instructs browsers as http to SSL (HTTPS) to use an encryption protocol for all communications between end users, websites and the Tool's servers. Such encryption prevents intruders from passively listen to communications between websites and users. Google also uses an encryption technology to protect personal data, so-called “data in rest"" (""data at rest"") in data centers, where user data is stored on a disk or backup media to prevent unauthorized access to the data. In addition to the above measures, website owners can use IP anonymization through to use the settings provided by the Tool to limit Google's use of personal data. Such settings include above all that in the code Page 13 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 14(27) Date: 2023-06-30 for the Tool enable IP anonymization, which means that IP addresses are truncated and contributes to data minimization. If the IP anonymization service is fully used occurs the anonymization of the IP address almost immediately after the request has been received. Google also restricts access to the data from the Tool through authorization control as well as by all personnel having undergone training regarding information security. 2 Justification of the decision 2.1 The framework for the review Based on the complaint in the case, IMY has only reviewed Dagens Industri transfer personal data to the third country USA within the framework of the Tool and about the company has legal support for it in chapter V of the data protection regulation. The supervision does not cover if the company's personal data processing in general is compatible with the data protection regulation. 2.2 This concerns the processing of personal data 2.2.1 Applicable regulations, etc. In order for the data protection regulation to be applicable, it is required that personal data treated. According to Article 1.2, the Data Protection Regulation aims to protect the data of natural persons fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their right to the protection of personal data. According to Article 4.1 of the Data Protection Regulation, personal data is ""any information which refers to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as a data subject), whereby an identifiable natural person is a person who directly or indirectly can identified in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, a location data or online identifiers or one or more factors which are specific to the natural person's physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity'. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, one should consider all the aids that, either of it personal data controller or by another person, may reasonably be used to directly or indirectly identify the natural person (reason 26 to data protection regulation). The term personal data can include all information, both objective and subjective information, provided that it ""refers"" to a specific person, which 12 they do if, due to their content, purpose or effect, they are linked to the person. The word ""indirectly"" in Article 4.1 of the Data Protection Regulation indicates that it is not necessary that the information itself makes it possible to identify the registered person for that to be a personal data. Recital 26 of the data protection regulation also states that in order to able to determine whether a natural person is identifiable, all aids, such as e.g. singling out), which, either by the personal data controller or by another person, may reasonably be used to directly or indirectly identify the natural person, is taken into account. To determine whether aids with reasonable 12 ECJ judgment Nowak, C-434/16, EU:C:2017:994, paragraphs 34–35. 13 ECJ judgment Breyer, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph 41. Page 14 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 15(27) Date: 2023-06-30 probability may be used to identify the natural person should all objective factors, such as costs and time required for identification, with consideration of available technology at the time of the treatment is taken into account. Of article 4.5 of the regulation states that pseudymisation refers to the processing of personal data in a way that means that the personal data can no longer be attributed a specific registered without the use of supplementary data, provided that these supplementary data are stored separately and are subject to technical and organizational measures that ensure that the personal data is not attributed to a identified or identifiable natural person. So-called ""web identifiers"" (sometimes referred to as ""online identifiers"") - e.g. IP addresses or information stored in cookies – can be used to identify a user, especially when combined with other similar types of information. According to recital 30 to data protection regulation, natural persons can be linked to online identifiers provided by their equipment, e.g. IP addresses, cookies or other identifiers. This can leave behind traces that, especially in combination with unique identifiers and other data such as collected, can be used to create profiles of natural persons and identify them. In the opinion from 2007, the Article 29 working group has clarified what they mean by aids which can reasonably be used for identification regarding, among other things, IP 14 addresses. The opinion states that all means that can reasonably be used to to identify the person concerned is, among other things, the cost of carrying out the identification, the intended purpose, how the processing is structured and technical errors. On the other hand consideration should be given to the state of the art at the time of treatment and the development opportunities during the period when the data will be processed, the factors are thus dynamic and may change over time. The wording of recital 26 of Directive 95/46 implies, by the reference to all aids which may reasonably be used by the personal data controller or another person, that it is not required that a single person possesses all the information that is necessary 15 to identify the data subject. In the Article 29 Group opinion from 2007, example number 15 states the following about dynamic IP addresses on a computer located at an Internet cafe where no one identification is required to use the internet. \[M\]one can argue that the data which collected regarding the use of computer X during a certain time does not make it possible to identify the user by reasonable means and that it is therefore not personal data\[s\]. 16 In the Breyer judgment, the European Court of Justice has determined that a person is not considered identifiable through some information about the risk of identification in practice is negligible, which it is identification of the relevant person is prohibited by law or impossible to carry out i 17 practice. However, the European Court of Justice has in the judgment M.I.C.M. from 2021 and in the judgment Breyer struck provided that dynamic IP addresses constitute personal data in relation to the person who processes them, when he also has a legal opportunity to identify the holders of the internet connections using the additional information provided by third parties 18 dispose of. 14 Opinion 4/2007 on the concept of personal data, 01248/07/SV WP 136, page 16. 15 16 ECJ judgment Breyer, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph 43. 17 Opinion 4/2007 on the concept of personal data, 01248/07/SV WP 136, page 17 and 18. 18 ECJ judgment Breyer, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraphs 45–46.

Page 15 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 16(27) Date: 2023-06-30 2.2.2 The Privacy Protection Authority's assessment To determine whether the information processed through the Tool constitutes personal data shall IMY take a position on Google or Dagens Industri through the implementation of The tool can identify individuals, e.g. the complainant, when visiting the Website or if 19 the risk of that is negligible. IMY considers the data processed to be personal data for the following reasons. The investigation shows that Dagens Industri implemented the Tool by inserting a JavaScript code (a tag), entered by Google, in the source code of the Website. While the page loads in the visitor's browser, the JavaScript code from Google is loaded LLC's servers are hosted and run locally in the visitor's browser. A cookie is placed at the same time in the visitor's browser and saved on the computer. The cookie contains a text file which collects information about the visitor's operation on the Website. Including a unique identifier is determined in the value of the cookie and this unique identifier generated and managed by Google. When the complainant visited the Website, or a sub-page of the Website, was transmitted the following information via JavaScript code from the complainant's browser to Google LLC's servers: 1. Unique identifier(s) that identified the browser or device used to visit the Website and a unique identifier that identifies the company (ie the company's Google Analytics account ID). 2. Web address (URL) and HTML title of the website and web page that the appellant has visited. 3. Information about browser, operating system, screen resolution, language setting and date and time of access to the Website. 4. Complainant's IP address. During the appellant's visit (according to point 1 above) said identifier was put in cookies with the names ""\_gads"", ""\_ga"" and ""\_gid"" and subsequently transferred to Google LLC. These identifiers have been created with the aim of being able to distinguish individual visitors, such as the appellant. The unique identifiers thus make the visitors to the Website identifiable. Although such unique identifiers (as per clause 1 above) would not in themselves considered to make individuals identifiable, it must however be considered that these unique identifiers in the current case can be combined with additional elements (according to points 2–4 above) and that it is possible to draw conclusions in relation to information (according to points 2–4 above) which means that data constitutes personal data, regardless of whether the IP address has not been transferred in its entirety. If information is combined (according to points 1–4 above), it means that individual visitors on The website becomes even more distinguishable. It is thus possible to identify individual visitors of the Website. That in itself is enough for it to be considered personal data. It does not require knowledge of the actual visitor's name or physical address, because the differentiation (through the word ""thinning"" in recital 26 i the data protection regulation, ""singling out"" in the English version) in itself is sufficient for to make the visitor indirectly identifiable. Nor is it required to Google or Dagens Industry intends to identify the complainant, but the ability to do so is inherent sufficient to determine whether it is possible to identify a visitor. Objective aids that can reasonably be used either by the personal data controller or 1See the Court of Appeal in Gothenburg's judgment of 11 November 2021 in case no. 2232-21, with the agreement of the sub-instance assessment. Page 16 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 17(27) Date: 2023-06-30 by someone else, are all aids that can reasonably be used for the purpose of identification the appellant. Examples of objective aids that can reasonably be used are access to additional information with a third party that would make it possible to identify appellant taking into account both available technology at the time of identification as well as the cost (time required) for the identification. IMY states that the European Court of Justice, through the judgment M.I.C.M. and the Breyer judgment established that dynamic IP addresses constitute personal data in relation to the person who processes them, when he also has a legal opportunity to identify the holders of the internet connections using the additional information provided by third parties 20 dispose of. IP addresses do not lose their character of being personal data alone due to the fact that the means of identification are with third parties. The Breyer ruling and The M.I.C.M judgment should be interpreted based on what is actually stated in the judgments ie. that about it there is a legal possibility to gain access to supplementary information for the purpose of identify the appellant it is objectively clear that there is a “means which reasonably can will be used' to identify the complainant. According to IMY, the judgments should not be read on the contrary, in the way that a legally regulated possibility to gain access must be demonstrated to data that can link IP addresses to natural persons so that the IP addresses will considered to be personal data. An interpretation of the concept of personal information which means that it must always be demonstrated a legal possibility to link such data to a physical person would, according to IMY, mean a significant limitation of the regulation protection area, and open up possibilities to circumvent the protection in the regulation. This one interpretation would, among other things, be contrary to the purpose of the regulation according to Article 1.2 i data protection regulation. The Breyer judgment was decided under previously applicable directives 95/46 and the concept of ""singling out"" according to recital 26 of the current regulation (that it does not knowledge of the actual visitor's name or physical address is required, because the distinction itself is sufficient to make the visitor identifiable), was not specified in previously applicable directives as a method for identifying personal data. In this context, other information is also added (according to points 1–3 above) such as IP the address can be combined with to enable identification. Although the truncation 21 of the last octet and ""hashing"" of the cookie value constitute privacy-enhancing measures, then they limit the scope of the data that authorities can access (i third country) IMY states that it is still possible to connect the transferred data to other data that is also transferred to Google LLC (to the USA). This makes it possible identification, which in itself is sufficient for the data together to constitute personal data. IMY notes that there may also be reasons to compare IP addresses with pseudonymised personal data. Pseudonymization of personal data means according to article 4.5 of the data protection regulation that the data - similar to dynamic IP addresses - cannot be directly attributed to a specific data subject without supplementary data is used. According to recital 26 of the data protection regulation, such data should considered to be information about an identifiable natural person. A narrower interpretation of the concept of personal data would undermine, according to IMY the scope of the right to the protection of personal data, which is guaranteed in Article 8 i 20 ECJ judgment M.I.C.M, C-597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraphs 102–104 and Breyer judgment, C-582/14 EU:C:2016:779, paragraph 49. 2 IP address truncation means that asterisks or zeros replace other digits in the last octets (the last digits of an IP address, a number between 0 and 255), which itself can only be one of 256 options. The effect of this action means that it is still possible to distinguish the IP address from the other IP addresses (255 options), because the IP the address can be linked with other transferred data (e.g. information about unit and time of visit) to third country. Page 17 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 18(27) Date: 2023-06-30 The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, because it would make it possible for personal data controllers to specifically single out individuals together with personal data (eg when they visit a certain website) at the same time as individuals are denied the right to protection against the dissemination of such information about them. Such an interpretation would undermine the level of protection for individuals and would not be compatible with the wide scope given by the data protection rules in the practice of the EU Court of Justice. 22 Dagens Industri has also, by the appellant being logged in to his Google account during the visit to the Website, processed data where conclusions could be drawn about the individual based on his registration with Google. By Google's opinion appears that implementing the Tool on a website makes it possible to get information that a user of a Google account (ie a registrant) has visited the website in question. Google does state that certain conditions must be met for that Google should be able to receive such information, e.g. that the user (complainant) does not have disabled the processing and display of personal ads. Since the complainant was logged into his Google account when visiting the Website, Google can still thus have had the opportunity to obtain information about the logged-in user visit to the Website. The fact that it does not appear from the complaint that no personalized ads have been shown, does not mean that Google cannot obtain information about it logged the user's visit to the Website. IMY finds against the background of the unique identifiers that can identify the browser or the device, the ability to derive the individual through his Google account, they the dynamic IP addresses as well as the possibility to combine these with additional ones information that Dagens Industri's use of the Tool on a web page entails Processing of personal data. 2.3 Dagens Industri is responsible for personal data the treatment Personal data controller is, among other things, a legal person who alone or together with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (Article 4.7 of the Data Protection Regulation). Personal data assistant is among another, a legal entity that processes personal data for the personal data- controller's account (Article 4.8 of the data protection regulation). The answers that Dagens Industri has provided show that it has made the decision to implement The tool on the Website. Furthermore, it appears that Dagens Industri's purpose with the implementation of the tool has been for the company to be able to analyze how The Website is used, and in particular to be able to follow the use of the Website over time. IMY finds that Dagens Industri by deciding to implement the Tool on The website for the said purpose, has determined the purposes and means of the collection and the subsequent processing of this personal data. Today's industry is therefore personal data controller for this treatment. 22 See, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice Latvijas Republikas Saeima (Points de pénalité), C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph 61, judgment Nowak, C-434/16, EU:C:2017:994, paragraph 33 and judgment Rijkeboer, C-553/07, EU:C:2009:293, paragraph 59. Page 18 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 19(27) Date: 2023-06-30 2.4 Transfer of personal data to third countries The investigation shows that the data collected via the Tool is stored by Google LLC in the United States. Thus, the personal data collected via the Tool is transferred to the United States. The question is therefore whether Dagens Industri's transfer of personal data to the USA is complies with Article 44 of the Data Protection Regulation and has legal support for it in Chapter V. 2.4.1 Applicable regulations, etc. According to article 44 of the data protection regulation, which has the title ""General principle for transfer of data"", includes the transfer of personal data that is under processing or are intended to be processed after they have been transferred to a third country - i.e. a country outside the EU/EEA - only take place under the condition that the personal data responsible and the personal data assistant, subject to other provisions in the data protection regulation, fulfills the conditions in chapter V. All provisions in said chapter shall be applied to ensure that the level of protection guaranteed by the data protection regulation is not undermined. Chapter V of the data protection regulation contains tools that can be used for transfers to third countries to ensure a level of protection essentially equivalent to that which guaranteed within the EU/EEA. It can e.g. be transfer supported by a decision on adequate level of protection (Article 45) and transfer covered by appropriate protective measures (Article 46). There are also exceptions for special situations (Article 49). In the judgment Schrems II, the Court of Justice of the European Union has annulled the decision on adequate protection level that previously applied to the transfer of personal data to the United States. Because a decision if an adequate level of protection since July 2020 is missing, transfers to the USA may not be established on Article 45. Article 46.1 provides, among other things, that in the absence of a decision in accordance with Article 45.3 a personal data controller or a personal data assistant may only transfer personal data to a third country after taking appropriate safeguards, and on conditions that statutory rights of registered and effective remedies for registered are available. Article 46.2 c stipulates that such suitable safeguards may take the form of standardized data protection regulations adopted by the Commission in accordance with the review procedure referred to in Article 93(2). In the judgment Schrems II, the European Court of Justice did not reject standard contract clauses which transfer tool. However, the court found that they are not binding on the authorities of the third country. The Court of Justice of the European Union stated that “\[even\] if thus there are situations where the recipient of such a transfer, depending on the legal situation and current practice in the third country concerned, can guarantee the necessary protection of data solely with the support of the standardized data protection regulations, exists the other situations in which the provisions of these clauses cannot be one sufficient means to ensure effective protection of the personal data in practice which is transferred to the third country concerned.' According to the European Court of Justice, this is ""among other things 23 Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 in accordance with the European Parliament and Council Directive 95/46/EC on whether adequate protection is ensured by the Privacy Shield in The European Union and the United States and the judgment of the European Court of Justice Facebook Ireland and Schrems (Schrems II), C- 311/18, EU:C:2020:559. Page 19 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 20(27) Date: 2023-06-30 the case when the legislation of the third country allows the authorities of that third country to do interference with the rights of the registered persons regarding these data.” 24 The reason why the European Court of Justice annulled the decision on adequate level of protection with the US was because of how the US intelligence services can gain access to personal data. According to the court, the conclusion of standard contract clauses cannot i ensure a level of protection required according to Article 44 of the Data Protection Regulation, as the guarantees stated therein do not apply when requested by such authorities access. The European Court of Justice therefore stated the following: ""It thus appears that the standardized data protection regulations which the commission adopted with the support of article 46.2 c of the same regulation only aims to provide the personal data controllers or their personal data assistants established in the Union contractual safeguards that are applied uniformly throughout third countries and thus independent of the level of protection ensured in each of these countries. Because these standardized data protection regulations, with regard to their nature, cannot lead to protective measures that go beyond a contractual obligation to ensure that the level of protection required under Union law is observed, it may be necessary, depending on the situation prevailing in a particular third country, for it personal data controller to take additional measures to ensure that the level of protection 25 observed"". In the European Data Protection Board's (EDPB) recommendations on the consequences of the judgment clarifies that if the assessment of legislation and practice in the third country involves that the protection that the transmission tool is supposed to guarantee cannot be maintained in practice the exporter must, within the framework of his transfer, as a rule either cancel the transfer or take appropriate additional protective measures. The EDPB thereby notes that ""further measures can only be considered effective in the sense referred to in the EU the court's judgment ""Schrems II"" if and to the extent that they - alone or in combination - addresses the specific deficiencies identified during the assessment of the situation i 27 the third country in terms of its laws and practices applicable to the transfer”. It appears from the EDPB's recommendations that such additional protective measures can fall into three categories: contractual, organizational and technical. 28 Regarding contractual measures, the EDPB states that such measures “\[...\] can supplement and reinforce the safeguards that the transfer tool and relevant legislation in the third country provides \[...\]. Considering that the contractual the measures are of such a nature that they cannot generally bind the authorities in it the third country because they are not parties to the agreement, these measures may often be necessary combined with other technical and organizational measures to provide it level of data protection required \[...\]'. 29 Regarding organizational measures, the EDPB emphasizes “\[a\]t choose and implement a or more of these measures will not necessarily and systematically ensure that \[a\] transfer meets the basic equivalence standard which 24 Paragraphs 125-126. 25 Item 133. 26EDPB, Recommendations 01/2020 on measures that supplement transfer tools to ensure compliance with the EU level of protection of personal data, Version 2.0, adopted on 18 June 2021 (hereinafter ""EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020”). 27 28EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 75: IMY's translation. 29 EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 52. EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 99; IMY's translation. Page 20 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 21(27) Date: 2023-06-30 required by EU legislation. Depending on the particular circumstances surrounding the transfer and the assessment made by the law of the third country is required organizational measures to supplement contractual and/or technical measures to ensure a level of protection for personal data that is substantially equivalent to that which is guaranteed within the EU/EEA”. 30 Regarding technical measures, the EDPB points out that “these measures will in particular be necessary when the legislation of that country imposes obligations on the importer which contravenes the guarantees in Article 46 of the Data Protection Regulation transfer tools and which in particular may infringe upon the contractual guarantee of one in all essentials equivalent protection against the authorities of the third country gaining access to these tasks"". The EDPB thereby states that ""the measures specified \[in the Recommendations\] are intended to ensure that access to the transmitted data for public authorities in third countries do not interfere with the expediency of the appropriate the safeguards in Article 46 of the Data Protection Regulation transfer tools. These measures would be necessary to guarantee a substantially equivalent level of protection as that guaranteed within the EU/EEA, even if the public ones access by the authorities is consistent with the legislation of the importer's country, where such access in practice goes beyond what is necessary and proportionate in one democratic society. The purpose of these measures is to prevent potentially unauthorized access by preventing the authorities from identifying the registered, drag conclusions about them, point them out in another context or connect the transmitted ones the data to other data sets which, among other things, may contain network identifiers such as provided by the devices, applications, tools and protocols used by 32 registered in other contexts"". 2.4.2 The Privacy Protection Authority's assessment 2.4.2.1 Applicable Transfer Tool The investigation shows that Dagens Industri and Google have entered into standardized agreements data protection provisions (standard contract clauses) in the sense referred to in Article 46 for the transfer of personal data to the United States. These clauses are in line with those which published by the European Commission in decision 2010/87/EU and therefore one transfer tools according to chapter V of the data protection regulation. 2.4.2.2 The legislation and the situation in the third country As can be seen from the judgment Schrems II, the use of standard contract clauses may require additional protective measures as a complement. Therefore, an analysis of the legislation in the relevant third country is made. IMY believes that the analysis that the EU Court has already done in the judgment Schrems II, which relates to similar conditions, is relevant and current, and that it can therefore be added basis for the assessment in the case without any further analysis of the legal the situation in the United States needs to be done. Google LLC, as the importer of the data into the United States, shall be classified as provider of electronic communications services within the meaning of 50 US Code § 1881 (b)(4). Google is therefore subject to surveillance by American intelligence services in accordance with 50 US § 1881a (“702 FISA”) and thus liable to provide the US government with personal data when 702 FISA is used. 30EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 128; IMY's translation. 31 EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 77; IMY's translation. 32EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 79; IMY's translation. Page 21 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 22(27) Date: 2023-06-30 The European Court of Justice found in the judgment Schrems II that the American surveillance programs based on 702 FISA, Executive Order 12333 (hereinafter “E.O. 12333”) and Presidential Policy Directive 28 (hereinafter “PPD-28”) in the American legislation does not correspond to the minimum requirements that apply in EU law according to the principle of proportionality. This means that the monitoring programs that are established on these provisions cannot be considered to be limited to what is strict necessary. The court also found that the monitoring programs do not provide the registered rights enforceable against US authorities i court, which means that these people do not have the right to an effective remedy. Against this background, IMY notes that the use of the EU Commission's standard contract clauses are not in themselves sufficient to achieve an acceptable level of protection for the transferred personal data. 2.4.2.3 Additional protective measures implemented by Google and Dagens Industri The next question is whether Dagens Industri has taken sufficient additional protective measures. Dagens Industri is the personal data controller and exporter of the personal data obliged to ensure that the rules in the data protection regulation are complied with. This responsibility includes among other things that in each individual case when transferring personal data to third countries assess which additional protective measures should be used and to what extent, including evaluating if the actions taken by the receiver (Google) and the exporter (Dagens Industri) taken together are sufficient to achieve an acceptable protection level. 2.4.2.3.1 Google's additional safeguards Google LLC, as an importer of personal data, has taken contractual, organizational and technical measures to complement the standard contract clauses. In a statement on April 9, 2021, Google described that the company has taken measures. The question is about the additional protective measures taken by Dagens Industri and Google LLC is effective, in other words hindering US intelligence services possibilities to gain access to the transferred personal data. As regards the legal and organizational measures, it can be stated that neither 34 information to users of the Tool (such as Dagens Industri), the publication of an transparency report or a publicly available “policy for the handling of government requests” hinder or reduce the U.S. intelligence agencies' opportunities to gain access to the personal data. Furthermore, it is not described what it is means that Google LLC's makes a ""careful examination of each request"" about the ""legality"" of American intelligence services. IMY notes that this does not affect the legality of such requests because, according to the European Court of Justice, they are not compatible with the requirements of the EU data protection regulations. As regards the technical measures taken, it can be stated that neither Google LLC or Dagens Industri have clarified how the described measures - such as protection of communication between Google services, protection of data when transferred between data center, protection of communications between users and websites or “physical security” – hinders or reduces the ability of US intelligence agencies to prepare access to the data with the support of the US regulations. 33Items 184 and 192. Item 259 et seq. 34Regardless of whether such a notification would even be permissible under US law. Page 22 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 23(27) Date: 2023-06-30 Regarding the encryption technology used – for example. for so-called ""data at rest"" (""data at rest"") in data centers, which Google LLC mentions as a technical measure - has Google LLC as an importer of personal data nevertheless an obligation to grant access to or hand over imported personal data at the disposal of Google LLC, including any encryption keys required to make the data intelligible. Thus such a technical measure cannot be considered effective as long as Google LLC has possibility to access the personal data in plain text. Regarding what Google LLC's stated that ""to the extent information for measurement i Google Analytics transmitted by website owners constitutes personal data, they receive considered to be pseudonymized” it can be stated that universal unique identifiers (UUID) is not covered by the concept of pseudonymisation in Article 4.5 of the data protection the regulation. Pseudonymization can be a privacy-enhancing technique, but the unique ones the identifiers have, as described above, the specific purpose of distinguishing users and not to act as protection. In addition, individuals are made identifiable through the above stated about the possibility of combining unique identifiers and other data (e.g. metadata from browsers or devices and the IP address) and the ability to link such information to a Google account for logged-in users. Regarding Google's measure regarding the anonymization of IP addresses in the form of truncation, it is not clear from Google's response if this action takes place before the transfer, or if the entire IP address is transferred to the United States and shortened only after the transfer to USA. From a technical point of view, it has thus not been shown that there is no potential access to the entire IP address before the last octet is truncated. Regarding the fact that Google LLC has configured the solution so that the JavaScript file cached in the receiving terminal's application cache for two hours (which can entail a delay between the first and second call of up to two hours) so this means that the calls can have different timestamps, which in itself could mean one complicating the identification of which visitor has issued the unique the call. IMY notes, however, that Dagens Industri cannot ensure that a delay of the calls actually takes place, partly because technically it cannot be ensured when (or if) a delay between the first and second call occurs, and then the control (the activation) of the caching is outside the company's control. Against this background, IMY notes that the additional protective measures taken by Google are not effective, as they do not prevent US intelligence services' ability to access the personal data or make such access ineffective. 2.4.2.3.2 Dagens Industri's own additional protective measures Dagens Industri has stated that the company has taken additional protective measures in addition the actions taken by Google. According to Dagens Industri, these consist of the company has carried out extensive mapping of the life cycle of personal data which processed in the Tool and that the company on its own data servers (the transfer through the proxy server) masks the last octet of the IP address and hashes the value in the cookies 37 before the data is transferred to Google. 35 See EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 81. 36 IP address truncation means that asterisks or zeros replace other digits in the last octets (the last digits of an IP address, a number between 0 and 255). 37 See above in the section on what the company has stated, under the heading ""Additional protective measures taken"". Page 23 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 24(27) Date: 2023-06-30 However, IMY finds that these measures are not sufficient for the following reasons. It appears from the company's own data that two separate transfers were made by the individual IP address goes to Google LLC - partly through a call from the measurement tool ""analytics.js"" 38 with the entire IP address exposed, partly with truncation of the last octet when measured data is transferred (and hashing of the cookie value). 39 Dagens Industri claims that what can be deduced from the first transfer (there the entire IP address is exposed) is only which web page the IP address has visited and that it is not possible to connect the IP address with the page view data etc. which at a later time measured on the Website. IMY notes, however, that the transfer in itself involves a transfer of personal data (the IP address), despite measures taken protective measures. As for the second transmission, it also contains additional information about the visit to Dagens Industri's website (such as the visitor's device and time of the visit) and the connection should therefore be possible with the IP address then the only difference after truncation is that the last octet is masked, which for IP addresses means only 256 options (ie a number between 0-255). Although the masking of the last octet and ""hashing"" of the cookie value constitutes privacy enhancement measures, as they limit the scope of the information that authorities can obtain access to (in a third country), IMY notes that it is still possible to connect the transferred the data to other data that is also transferred to Google LLC. Against this background, IMY notes that neither the additional measures which taken by the company, in addition to the additional measures taken by Google, is sufficient effective in preventing US intelligence agencies from accessing the personal data or render such access ineffective. 2.4.2.3.3 The Privacy Protection Authority's conclusion IMY finds that Dagens Industri's and Google's actions were neither isolated nor taken together are effective enough to thwart US intelligence possibility of gaining access to the personal data or making such access ineffective. Against this background, IMY finds that neither standard contract clauses nor the others measures invoked by Dagens Industri can provide such support for the transfer as stated in chapter V of the data protection regulation. With this transfer of data, Dagens Industri is therefore undermining it level of protection of personal data of data subjects guaranteed in Article 44 i data protection regulation. IMY therefore states that Dagens Industri Aktiebolag violates Article 44 i data protection regulation. 38 IP address truncation means that asterisks or zeros replace other digits in the last octets (the last digits of an IP address, a number between 0 and 255), which itself can only be one of 256 options. The effect of this action means that it is still possible to distinguish the IP address from the other IP addresses (255 options), because the IP the address can be linked with other transferred data (e.g. information about unit and time of visit) to third country. 39 See above in section 1.3.17.1, illustration of data flows (p. 8 of the company's statement). Page 24 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 25(27) Date: 2023-06-30 3 Choice of intervention 3.1 Legal regulation In the event of violations of the data protection regulation, IMY has a number of corrective measures powers to be available according to Article 58.2 a–j of the data protection regulation, among other things reprimand, injunction and penalty fees. IMY shall impose penalty fees in addition to or in lieu of other corrective measures as referred to in Article 58(2), depending on the circumstances of each individual case. Each supervisory authority must ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty charges in each individual case are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The stated in Article 83.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. In article 83.2 of the data protection regulation, the factors that must be considered in order to decide whether an administrative penalty fee should be imposed, but also at the determination of the amount of the penalty fee. If it is a question of a smaller one breach will receive the IMY as set out in recital 148 instead of imposing a penalty fee issue a reprimand according to article 58.2 b of the regulation. Consideration shall in the assessment, aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the case are taken into account, such as the nature, severity and duration of the breach and previous breaches of relevance. According to article 83.5 c of the data protection regulation, in the event of a violation of among article 44 in accordance with 83.2 administrative penalty fees of up to 20 million are imposed EUR or, in the case of a company, of up to 4% of the total global the annual turnover during the previous budget year, depending on which value is the highest. 3.2 Should a penalty fee be imposed? IMY has found above that the transfers of personal data to the USA that take place via The Google Analytics tool and which Dagens Industri is responsible for conflicts with article 44 of the data protection regulation. Violations of that provision can, as shown above, incur penalty charges. In the current case, it is a question of a serious one violation which should normally result in a penalty fee. When assessing in this case whether a penalty fee should be imposed, it must be in the aggravating direction taken into account that the violation has occurred through Dagens Industri having transferred a large amount of personal data to third countries where the data cannot be guaranteed level of protection provided in the EU/EEA. The treatment has taken place systematically and during a longer time. After the European Court of Justice, by judgment on 16 July 2020, refused 40 the commission's decision on an adequate level of protection in the USA changed the conditions for transfers of personal data to the United States. About 3 years have now passed since the verdict was announced and the EDPB has during that time made recommendations on the consequences of the judgment for public consultation on 10 November 2020 and finally form on 18 June 2021. 40 Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 according to the European Parliament and the Council directive 95/46/EC on whether adequate protection is ensured by the privacy shield in the EU and the United the states. Page 25 of 27The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11370 26(27) Date: 2023-06-30 In the mitigating direction, the special situation that arose after must be taken into account the judgment and the interpretation of the EDPB's recommendations, where there was a gap after that the transfer tool to the USA according to the Commission's previous decision was rejected by European Court of Justice. In addition, it must be taken into account that it appears from the investigation that Dagens Industri has made a serious analysis and mapping of the life cycle of personal data in the Tool. Dagens Industri has also taken measures such as that the company on own data servers (the transmission through the proxy server) mask the last octet of the IP the address (truncation) and hashes the value in the cookies before the data is transferred to Google. The company has also activated Google's ""anonymization of IP addresses"" measure by truncation. Dagens Industri has thus taken relatively extensive measures measures to try to limit the risks for the data subjects and to cure the deficiencies. Dagens Industri has thereby also believed that they succeeded even if the measures in the practice now proved not to be effective. In a balanced assessment, IMY finds that there is reason to in this case refrain from imposing a penalty fee on Dagens Industri for the found the breach and stop at an injunction to remedy the deficiency. 3.3 Other interventions It appears from the investigation that the safeguards for transfer invoked by Dagens Industri cannot provide support for the transfer according to chapter V i data protection regulation. The transfer thus involves a violation of the regulation. To ensure that the infringement ceases, Dagens Industri shall ordered according to article 58.2 d of the data protection regulation to ensure that the company's processing of personal data within the framework of the use of the Google tool Analytics complies with Article 44 and other provisions of Chapter V. This shall in particular be done by Dagens Industri ceasing to use that version of the Google Analytics tool used on August 14, 2020, if not sufficient protective measures have been taken. The measures must be completed no later than one month after this decision gained legal force. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This decision has been taken by the general manager Lena Lindgren Schelin after a presentation by lawyer Sandra Arvidsson. In the final proceedings, the chief justice also has David Törngren, unit manager Catharina Fernquist and IT- and information security specialist Mats Juhlén participated.

IMY decides with the support of article 58.2 and 83 of the data protection regulation that Tele2 Sweden Aktiebolag must pay an administrative sanction fee of 12 million (twelve million) kroner for violation of Article 44 of the data protection regulation. 1 Description of the supervisory matter 1.1 The processing The Swedish Privacy Protection Agency (IMY) has started supervision of Tele2 Sweden Limited company (hereinafter Tele2 or the company) due to a complaint. The complaint applies to an alleged violation of the provisions of Chapter V i data protection regulation linked to the transfer of the complainant's personal data to third country. The transfer allegedly took place when the complainant visited the company's website, www.tele2.se (hereinafter ""Tele2's website"" or ""Website"") through the tool Google Analytics (hereinafter the Tool) provided by Google LLC. The complaint has been handed over to IMY, in its capacity as the responsible supervisory authority according to Article 56 of the Data Protection Regulation. The handover has taken place from the supervisory authority in the country where the complainant has filed his complaint (Austria) in accordance with the regulation's provisions on cooperation in cross-border processing. The proceedings at IMY have taken place through an exchange of letters. 1.2 What is stated in the complaint The complaint essentially states the following. On August 14, 2020, the complainant visited Tele2's website. During the visit, the complainant signed in to his Google account, which is linked to the complainant's email address. The company had implemented a Javascript code for Google services on its website, including Google Analytics. In accordance with clause 5.1.1 b of the terms of Google's processing of personal data for Google's advertising products and also Google's terms and conditions for processing ""the New Order Data Processing Conditions for Google Advertising Products"" Google processes personal data of the data controller (i.e. the company's) account. Google LLC must therefore, according to the above-mentioned conditions, be classified as the company's personal data assistant. During the complainant's visit to the company's website, the complainant was treated personal data of Tele2, at least the complainant's IP address and data collected through cookies. Some of the data collected was transferred directly to Google. IN 1 regarding the processing of personal data and about the free flow of such data and about the cancellation of avr med directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). Page 3 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 4(23) Date: 2023-06-30 in accordance with clause 10 of the terms on the processing of personal data for Googles advertising products, Tele2 has approved that Google may process personal data about the appellant in the United States. Such transfer of data requires legal support in accordance with chapter V of the data protection regulation. According to the judgment of the European Court of Justice Facebook Ireland and Schrems (Schrems II), 2 the company can no longer rely on a decision on an adequate level of protection for the transfer of data to the United States according to Article 45 of the Data Protection Regulation. The company should not base the transfer of data on standardized data protection regulations according to article 46.2 c of the data protection regulation if the recipient country does not ensure adequate protection with regard to Union law for the personal data that is transferred. Google shall be classified as a provider of electronic communications services in it meaning referred to in 50 US Code § 1881 (4)(b) and is thus subject to surveillance by US intelligence agencies in accordance with 50 US § 1881a (section 702 i 3 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, hereinafter “702 FISA”). Google provides it US government with personal data in accordance with these regulations. The company cannot therefore ensure adequate protection of the complainant's personal data when these are transferred to Google. 1.3 What Tele2 has stated Tele2 Sverige Aktiebolag has essentially stated the following. 1.3.1 Who has implemented the Tool and for what purpose, etc. Tele2 has made the decision to implement Google Analytics (the ""Tool"") on The website, which has happened by embedding the code for the Tool on The website. The Company began decommissioning the version of the Tool covered by IMY oversight in spring 2022 and stopped using that version in June 2023 but have not been able to give an exact date for this. The company is established in Sweden and has not made such a decision for any other European site. The purpose of using the Tool is to be able to compile and analyze statistics regarding visits to the Website. The statistics regarding the visits to the Website obtained via the Tool have only evaluated by Tele2 in Sweden. There is no option to make any choices in the Tool's settings transfer of data to the United States. 1.3.2 Recipient of the data Within the framework of Tele2's use of the Tool on the Website, information is provided out to a number of actors, all of whom are personal data assistants or sub-assistants to the company, including Google LLC, Google Ireland Ltd and their subsidiaries. 2 ECJ judgment Facebook Ireland and Schrems (Schrems II), C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559. 3See https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/html/USCODE-2011-title50-chap36-subchapVI- sec1881.htm and https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/html/USCODE-2011-title50-chap36- subchapVI-sec1881a.htm. Page 4 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 5(23) Date: 2023-06-30 1.3.3 The data processed in the Tool and what constitutes it personal data The information processed by Tele2 and Google within the framework of the Tool includes (i) information about the visit to the Website, e.g. which pages are displayed or which clicks are made, (ii) information about the device calling the Website and (iii) information in the cookie (\_ga cookie) which consists of the Client ID. Tele2 uses the Verktyget service to analyze statistics regarding visits to the website www.tele2.se. All statistics and reports generated via the Tool is produced at an aggregate level and cannot be used to directly or indirectly identify any natural person. Production of statistics and reports via the Tool is made possible by cookies used on the Website. If a visitor to the Website has agreed to cookies are used, a cookie is placed in the visitor's browser. The information that processed through use of the Tool thus consists of the following categories: (i) information about the visit to the Website, e.g. which pages are displayed or which clicks that is done, (ii) information about the entity visiting the Website and (iii) information in the cookie (\_ga cookie) which is made up of the Client ID. (i) The information about the visit to the Website Information regarding the visit to the Website does not in itself contain any information which can be used to directly or indirectly identify any natural person, i.e. one a page view or a click constitutes completely anonymous information in itself. (ii) Information about the entity visiting the Website Information about the device that calls and visits the Website consists of e.g. of which type of browser and which IP address is used during the visit. As for the IP addresses nowadays static IP addresses are used only by a few companies and organizations. Otherwise, exclusively dynamic IP addresses are used for everyone consumers. A dynamic IP address simply means that a device is assigned an IP address at each connection to the Internet and the device is then assigned completely new IP addresses on subsequent connection occasions. A device is not necessarily a computer, mobile phone or a tablet but can in many cases be a router or other device that then multiple computers, mobiles or tablets connect to and the IP address can therefore not be derived to the computer, mobile phone or tablet but to the router. To be able to indirectly identify a person using a dynamic IP address is required that it is supplemented with a time when it was used and that additionally information is collected about who has been assigned the IP address from the visitor internet provider. In the Tool, the IP address is only used for the purpose of analyzing statistics regarding the visits to a website. For that purpose, a user of the Tool should not possess any legal means according to Swedish law that make it possible to collect them supplementary information required to be able to indirectly identify a physical person. The IP address collected through the Tool is also anonymized in principle immediately after the collection by the numbers after the last point of the IP address is replaced by 0 (eg 192.169.0.100 becomes 192.168.0.0). Such IP anonymization takes place at the earliest possible stage during the collection process and the full IP the address is never saved or processed on disk. For more information about anonymization Page 5 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 6(23) Date: 2023-06-30 of IP address in the Tool, see https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en. Anonymization of the IP address thus means that the user of the Tool never has access to the full IP address and there are then no aids like one users of the Tool can reasonably use to indirectly identify a physical person (cf. consideration clause 26 in the GDPR) with the consequence that the risk of identification in practice can be considered negligible. (iii) Information in \_ga cookie The information that is processed through the use of the \_ga cookie consists of a Client ID. The Client ID consists of a random number with a timestamp that is saved in the \_ga cookie. This Client ID can be used to see about a browser has previously connected to the Website. However, Tele2 cannot use Client ID individually or together with an anonymized IP address to directly or indirectly identify a natural person. Due to the above, Tele2 believes that Tele2 can be called into question at all processes and transfers personal data to third countries. Taking into account that some uncertainty may be considered to exist in relation to the legal assessment of the aforementioned conditions, for precautionary reasons, Tele2 has chosen to apply the rules in the data protection regulation for them information processed within the framework of the Tool. 1.3.4 Categories of persons affected by the processing The information concerns visitors to the Website. No particular categories of personal data as defined in Article 9.1 of the Data Protection Regulation is processed within the framework of the Tool. Tele2 cannot use the Tool to identify different categories of people visiting the Website. The website is aimed neither at children, nor any other special category of registrants and visitors to the Website needs do not enter any age, or any other personal data that is processed in the Tool. 1.3.5 When the code for the Tool is executed and recipients are provided access The tool is activated and cookies are placed in the user's browser after the visitor has given his consent to the use of cookies. Anonymization of IP address occurs at the earliest possible stage during the collection process and the complete The IP address is never saved or processed on disk by Google (https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en&ref\_topic=2919631). 1.3.6 How long the personal data processed is stored During the time the Tool is used, a storage period of up to 26 months can be set The tool. If the agreement for the Tool ceases to apply, Google undertakes according to the personal data processor agreement to delete personal data in the Tool as soon as it is practically possible after the termination of the agreement, but no later than within 180 days. 1.3.7 In which countries the personal data is processed According to the information Tele2 has received from Google, the visitor's IP address of the data center closest to where the visitor connects from. According to the terms of the agreement with Google, Google can process within the framework of the Tool the data in i.a. USA. 1.3.8 Tele2's relationship with Google LCC Tele2 considers Google as a personal data processor for the processing that takes place within the framework of the Tool ie. Google processes the information in the Tool only for Page 6 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 7(23) Date: 2023-06-30 Tele2's bill. This is also supported by the agreement between Tele2 and Google regarding The Tool and the personal data processor agreement that applies to the Tool. 1.3.9 Ensuring that the processing does not take place for the recipients' own purposes Pursuant to clause 5.3 of the personal data processing agreement with Google, Google may only process personal data in accordance with Tele2's instructions. Tele2's use of The tool means that IP addresses are anonymized at the earliest possible stage during the collection process and that the full IP address is never saved or processed on disk by Google. This means that Google cannot process it the full IP address for own or third party purposes. 1.3.10 Description of the company's use of the Tool Tele2 uses the Tool to analyze statistics regarding visits to The website. All statistics and reports generated via the Tool are produced on aggregate level and no action is taken in relation to individual visitors on The website within the framework of the Tool. 1.3.11 Own checks on transfers affected by the Schrems II judgment After the Schrems II verdict, Tele2 initiated internal work to review all of them international data transfers in Tele2's operations. This review has also covered The tool. Tele2 has had an ongoing dialogue with Google which has meant that since 12 August 2020, the transfer of data to Google in the USA has been based on standard contractual clauses for data protection adopted by the Commission. Because the EU the court in the judgment Schrems II held that the legislation covered by Google i The US does not correspond to the level of protection found in European data protection legislation, so it is supplementary protective measures necessary when using them standard contractual clauses for data protection adopted by the Commission. In the dialogue with Google, Tele2 has therefore discussed which additional protective measures are may be taken in relation to the Tool. It has then been established that the protective measures used in relation to the Tool is IP anonymisation (which has been enabled by Tele2 ever since the Tool was introduced). In addition, Google has ISO270001 certification for The tool and Google also use different encryption solutions in connection with The Tool and the Transfer of Data to the United States. 1.3.12 Transfer tool according to chapter V of the data protection regulation To the extent that personal data is transferred to the United States, the transfer is based on Article 46.2 c i data protection regulation (standard contractual clauses for data protection adopted by the Commission). Standard contractual clauses apply to the data transfer in the Tool. The standard contract clauses are not signed by the parties but are included as part of the personal data processor agreement with Google by reference to these standard contractual clauses in clause 10.2 of the personal data processor agreement. 1.3.13 Control of obstacles to enforcement in legislation in third countries In the EDPB's recommendation 01/2020, it is stated, among other things, that pseudonymisation and anonymization are such additional safeguards that may be taken to achieve a level of protection equivalent to that found in Europe and thus enable a transfer of personal data to the United States based on standard data protection contractual clauses that adopted by the Commission. Page 7 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 8(23) Date: 2023-06-30 Tele2's assessment, based on the additional protective measures used in connection with the Tool, is therefore that the data is adequately protected and that the level of protection then corresponds to that found in European data protection legislation. Tele2 has checked that the supplementary protective measures taken can implemented in practice and that there is nothing in third country legislation which prevents the recipients there from implementing the measures to ensure that the level of data protection for natural persons guaranteed within the EU/EEA is not undermined. 1.3.14 Additional safeguards taken in addition to those taken by Google Tele2 has set IP anonymization for the Tool. 1.4 What Google LCC has stated IMY has added to the case an opinion from Google LLC (Google) on April 9, 2021 which Google submitted to the Austrian supervisory authority. The statement answers questions which IMY and a number of supervisory authorities have asked Google due to in part joint handling of similar complaints received by these authorities. Tele2 has been given the opportunity to comment on Google's statement. By Google's opinion the following appears about the Tool. A JavaScript code is included on a web page. When a user visits (calls) a web page, the code triggers a download of a JavaScript file. Then performed the tracking operation of the Tool, which consists of collecting information related to to the call in different ways and send the information to the Tool's servers. A website administrator who has integrated the Tool on his website can send instructions to Google for processing the data collected. These instructions are transmitted via the so-called tag manager that handles it tracking code that the webmaster has integrated into his website and via tag manager settings. Whoever integrated the Tool can do different things settings, for example regarding storage time. The tool also makes it possible for it which integrated it to monitor and maintain the stability of its website, for example by staying informed about events such as peaks in visitor traffic or lack of traffic. The tool also enables a website administrator to measure and optimize the effectiveness of advertising campaigns carried out using other tools from Google. In this context, the Tool collects the visitor's http calls and information about including the visitor's browser and operating system. According to Google, contains one http calls for any page information about the browser and device making the call, such as domain name, and information about the browser, such as type, reference and language. The tool stores and reads cookies in the visitor's browser in order to evaluate the visitor's session and other information about the call. Through these cookies enable the Tool to identify unique users (UUID) over browsing sessions, but the Tool cannot identify unique users in different browsers or units. If a website owner's website has its own authentication system can the website owner use the ID feature, to more accurately identify one users on all the devices and browsers they use to access the website. When the information is collected, it is transferred to the Tool's servers. All data that collected via The tool is stored in the United States. Page 8 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 9(23) Date: 2023-06-30 Google has introduced, among other things, the following contractual, organizational and technical safeguards to regulate transfers of data within the framework of The tool. Google has taken contractual and organizational safeguards such as to the company always conducts a thorough examination of a request for access from government authorities on user data can be implemented. It is lawyers/specially trained staff conducting these trials and investigating whether such a request is compliant with applicable laws and Google's guidelines. Those registered are informed the disclosure, unless prohibited by law or would adversely affect one emergency. Google has also published a policy on the company's website about how a such requests for access by governmental authorities of user data shall be implemented. Google has taken technical protective measures such as protecting personal data from interception when transferring data in the Tool. By default using HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which instructs browsers as http to SSL (HTTPS) to use an encryption protocol for all communications between end users, websites and the Tool's servers. Such encryption prevents intruders from passively listen to communications between websites and users. Google also uses an encryption technology to protect personal data, so-called “data in rest"" (""data at rest"") in data centers, where user data is stored on a disk or backup media to prevent unauthorized access to the data. In addition to the above measures, website owners can use IP anonymization through to use the settings provided by the Tool to limit Google's use of personal data. Such settings include above all that in the code for the Tool enable IP anonymization, which means that IP addresses are truncated and contributes to data minimization. If the IP anonymization service is fully used occurs the anonymization of the IP address almost immediately after the request has been received. Google also restricts access to the data from the Tool through authorization control as well as by all personnel having undergone training regarding information security. 2 Justification of the decision 2.1 The framework for the review Based on the complaint in the case, IMY has only examined whether Tele2 transmits personal data to the third country USA within the framework of Tele2's use of the Tool and if Tele2s has legal support for it in chapter V of the data protection regulation. Supervision does not include whether Tele2's personal data processing is otherwise compatible with data protection regulation. 2.2 This concerns the processing of personal data 2.2.1 Applicable regulations, etc. In order for the data protection regulation to be applicable, it is required that personal data treated. According to Article 1.2, the Data Protection Regulation aims to protect the data of natural persons fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their right to the protection of personal data. Page 9 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 10(23) Date: 2023-06-30 According to Article 4.1 of the regulation, personal data is ""any information relating to a identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as a data subject), whereby a identifiable natural person is a person who can be directly or indirectly specifically identified referring to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, a location data or online identifiers or one or more factors that are specific to the natural person's physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity'. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, one should consider all the aids that, either of it personal data controller or by another person, may reasonably be used to directly or indirectly identify the natural person (reason 26 to data protection regulation). The term personal data can include all information, both objective and subjective information, provided that it ""refers"" to a specific person, which they do if, due to their content, purpose or effect, they are linked to the person. 4 The word ""indirectly"" in Article 4.1 of the Data Protection Regulation indicates that it is not necessary that the information itself makes it possible to identify the registered person for that to be a personal data. Recital 26 of the data protection regulation also states that in order to determine whether a natural person is identifiable, all aids, such as e.g. thinning (""singling out"" in the English language version), which, either of it personal data controller or by another person, may reasonably be used to directly or indirectly identify the natural person, is taken into account. To determine if aids can with reasonable probability be used to identify it the natural person should all objective factors, such as costs and time consumption for identification, taking into account both available technology at the time of processing, considered. It is clear from Article 4.5 of the regulation that pseudymisation is meant processing of personal data in a way that means that the personal data does not longer can be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of supplementary information, provided that this additional information is kept separately and is subject for technical and organizational measures that ensure that the personal data does not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. So-called ""web identifiers"" (sometimes referred to as ""online identifiers"") - e.g. IP addresses or information stored in cookies – can be used to identify a user, especially when combined with other similar types of information. According to recital 30 to data protection regulation, natural persons can be linked to online identifiers provided by their equipment, e.g. IP addresses, cookies or other identifiers. This can leave behind traces that, especially in combination with unique identifiers and other data such as collected, can be used to create profiles of natural persons and identify them. In the Breyer judgment, the European Court of Justice has determined that a person is not considered identifiable through some information about the risk of identification in practice is negligible, which it is identification of the relevant person is prohibited by law or impossible to carry out i 6 practice. However, the European Court of Justice has in the judgment M.I.C.M. from 2021 and in the judgment Breyer struck provided that dynamic IP addresses constitute personal data in relation to the person who processes them, when he also has a legal opportunity to identify the holders of 4 ECJ judgment Nowak, C-434/16, EU:C:2017:994, paragraphs 34–35. 5 CJEU judgment Breyer, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph 41. 6 CJEU judgment Breyer, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraphs 45–46. Page 10 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 11(23) Date: 2023-06-30 the internet connections using the additional information provided by third parties dispose of.7 2.2.2 The Privacy Protection Authority's assessment To determine whether the information processed through the Tool constitutes personal data shall IMY take a decision on whether Google or Tele2 through the implementation of the Tool can identify individuals, e.g. the complainant, when visiting the Website or about the risk of it is negligible. 8 IMY considers the data processed to be personal data for the following reasons. The investigation shows that Tele2 implemented the Tool by inserting a JavaScript code (a tag), entered by Google in the source code of the Website. While the page is loaded in the visitor's browser, the JavaScript code from Google LLC's is loaded servers and run locally in the visitor's browser. A cookie is inserted at the same time the visitor's browser and saved on the computer. The cookie contains a text file that collects information about the visitor's operation on the Website. Among other things, a unique identifier in the value of the cookie and this unique identifier is generated and managed by Google. When the complainant visited the Website, or a sub-page of the Website, was transmitted the following information via JavaScript code from the complainant's browser to Google LLC's servers: 1. Unique identifier(s) that identified the browser or device used to visit the Website as well as a unique identifier that identifies Tele2 (ie Tele2's account ID for Google Analytics). 2. Web address (URL) and HTML title of the website and web page that the appellant has visited. 3. Information about browser, operating system, screen resolution, language setting and date and time of access to the Website. 4. Complainant's IP address. During the appellant's visit (according to point 1 above) said identifier was put in cookies with the names ""\_gads"", ""\_ga"" and ""\_gid"" and subsequently transferred to Google LLC. These identifiers have been created with the aim of being able to distinguish individual visitors, such as the appellant. The unique identifiers thus make the visitors to the Website identifiable. Although such unique identifiers (as per 1 above) would not in themselves be considered make individuals identifiable, however, it must be considered that these unique identifiers in it the current case can be combined with additional elements (according to points 2-4 above) and that it is possible to draw conclusions in relation to information (according to the points 2–4 above) which means that information constitutes personal data, regardless of whether the IP address is not transferred in its entirety. If information is combined (according to points 1–4 above), it means that individual visitors on The site becomes even more distinguishable. It is thus possible to identify individual visitors of the Website. That in itself is enough for it to be considered personal data. It does not require knowledge of the actual visitor's name or physical address, because the differentiation (through the word ""thinning"" in recital 26 i 7 CJEU judgment M.I.C.M, C-597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraphs 102–104 and judgment Breyer, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph 49. 8 See the Court of Appeal in Gothenburg's judgment of 11 November 2021 in case no. 2232-21, with the agreement of the sub-instance assessment. Page 11 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 12(23) Date: 2023-06-30 the data protection regulation, ""singling out"" in the English version) in itself is sufficient for to make the visitor indirectly identifiable. It is also not required that Google or Tele2 have for the purpose of identifying the appellant, but the opportunity to do so is in itself sufficient for to determine whether it is possible to identify a visitor. Objective aids such as can reasonably be used either by the personal data controller or by someone other, are all aids that can reasonably be used for the purpose of identifying the appellant. Examples of objective aids that can reasonably be used are access to additional information with a third party that would make it possible to identify the complainant with taking into account both available technology at the time of identification as well as cost (the time required) for the identification. IMY states that the European Court of Justice, through the judgment M.I.C.M. and the Breyer ruling stated that dynamic IP addresses constitute personal data in relation to the person who processes them, when he also has a legal opportunity to identify the holders of the internet connections using the additional information provided by third parties dispose of. IP addresses do not lose their character of being personal data alone due to the fact that the means of identification are with third parties. The Breyer ruling and The M.I.C.M judgment should be interpreted based on what is actually stated in the judgments ie. that about it there is a legal possibility to gain access to supplementary information for the purpose of identify the appellant it is objectively clear that there is a “means which reasonably can will be used' to identify the complainant. According to IMY, the judgments should not be read on the contrary, in the way that a legally regulated possibility to gain access must be demonstrated to data that can link IP addresses to natural persons so that the IP addresses will considered to be personal data. An interpretation of the concept of personal information which means that it must always be demonstrated a legal possibility to link such data to a physical person would, according to IMY, mean a significant limitation of the regulation protection area, and open up possibilities to circumvent the protection in the regulation. This one interpretation would, among other things, be contrary to the purpose of the regulation according to Article 1.2 i data protection regulation. The Breyer judgment was decided under previously applicable directives 95/46 and the concept of ""singling out"" according to recital 26 of the current regulation (that it does not knowledge of the actual visitor's name or physical address is required, because the distinction itself is sufficient to make the visitor identifiable), was not specified in previously applicable directives as a method for identifying personal data. In this context, other information is also added (according to points 1–3 above) such as IP the address can be combined with to enable identification. Google action regarding truncation of an IP address means that it is still possible to distinguish IP- the address, as it can be combined with other data transferred to third country (to the USA). This enables identification, which in itself is sufficient to the data together shall constitute personal data. In addition, several other supervisory authorities within the EU/ESS have decided that the transfer of personal data to third countries has occurred when using the Tool because it it has been possible to combine IP addresses with other data (according to points 1–3 above), and thereby enabled differentiation of data and identification of IP address, 9 ECJ judgment M.I.C.M, C-597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraphs 102-104 and Breyer judgment, C-582/14 EU:C:2016:779, paragraph 49. 10 IP address truncation means that asterisks or zeros replace other digits in the last octets (the last digits of an IP address, a number between 0 and 255), which itself can only be one of 256 options. The effect of this action means that it is still possible to distinguish the IP address from the other IP addresses (255 options), because the IP the address can be linked with other transferred data (e.g. information about unit and time of visit) to third country. Page 12 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 13(23) Date: 2023-06-30 which in itself is sufficient to determine that it is a matter of treatment of personal data. 11 IMY notes that there may also be reasons to compare IP addresses with pseudonymised personal data. Pseudonymization of personal data means according to article 4.5 of the data protection regulation that the data - similar to dynamic IP addresses - cannot be directly attributed to a specific data subject without supplementary data is used. According to recital 26 of the data protection regulation, such data should considered to be information about an identifiable natural person. A narrower interpretation of the concept of personal data would undermine, according to IMY the scope of the right to the protection of personal data, which is guaranteed in Article 8 i The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, because it would make it possible for personal data controllers to specifically single out individuals together with personal data (eg when they visit a certain website) at the same time as individuals are denied the right to protection against the dissemination of such information about them. Such an interpretation would undermine the level of protection for individuals and would not be compatible with the wide scope given by the data protection rules in the practice of the EU Court of Justice. 12 Tele2 has also, by the fact that the complainant was logged in to his Google account at the visit to the Website, processed information where conclusions could be drawn about it individual based on their registration with Google. It appears from Google's statement that implementation of the Tool on a website makes it possible to obtain information about a user of a Google account (ie a registrant) has visited the website in question. Google does state that certain conditions must be met for Google to be able to receive such information, e.g. that the user (complainant) has not deactivated processing and display of personal advertisements. Because the appellant was logged in in their Google account when visiting the Website, Google can therefore still have had the opportunity to receive information about the logged-in user's visits to The website. The fact that it does not appear from the complaint that no personal ads have been shown, does not mean that Google cannot obtain information about the logged in person the user's visit to the Website. IMY finds against the background of the unique identifiers that can identify the browser or the device, the ability to derive the individual through his Google account, they the dynamic IP addresses as well as the possibility to combine these with additional ones information that Tele2's use of the Tool on a web page involves processing of personal data. 2.3 Tele2 is the personal data controller for the processing Personal data controller is, among other things, a legal person who alone or together with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (Article 4.7 of the Data Protection Regulation). Personal data assistant is among another, a legal entity that processes personal data for it account of the personal data controller (Article 4.8 of the data protection regulation). 11Austrian supervisory authority (Datenschultzbehörde) decision of 22 April 2022 regarding complaint Google Analytics represented by NOYB with local case number 1354838270, French regulatory authority (CNIL) decision of February 10, 2022 represented by NOYB and the Italian Supervisory Authority (Garante) decision of June 9, 2022 regarding complaint Google Analytics represented by NOYB, local case number 9782890. 12 See, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice Latvijas Republikas Saeima (Points de pénalité), C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph 61, judgment Nowak, C-434/16, EU:C:2017:994, paragraph 33 and judgment Rijkeboer, C-553/07, EU:C:2009:293, paragraph 59. Page 13 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 14(23) Date: 2023-06-30 The answers that Tele2 gives show that the company has made the decision to implement The tool on the Website. Furthermore, it appears that Tele2's purpose for this was that the company must be able to analyze how the Website is used, in particular to be able to follow the use of the website over time. IMY finds that Tele2 by deciding to implement the Tool on the Website i said purpose has established the purposes and means of the collection and it the subsequent transfer of this personal data. Tele2 is therefore personal data controller for this processing. 2.4 Transfer of personal data to third countries The investigation shows that the data collected via the Tool is stored by Google LLC in the United States. Thus, the personal data collected via the Tool is transferred to the United States. The question is therefore whether Tele2's transfer of personal data to the USA is compatible with Article 44 of the Data Protection Regulation and has legal support for it in Chapter V. 2.4.1 Applicable regulations, etc. According to article 44 of the data protection regulation, which has the title ""General principle for transfer of data"", includes the transfer of personal data that is under processing or are intended to be processed after they have been transferred to a third country – i.e. a country outside the EU/EEA - only take place under the condition that it personal data controller and the personal data assistant, subject to others provisions of the data protection regulation, meet the conditions in chapter V. All provisions of said chapter shall be applied to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons ensured by the data protection regulation is not undermined. Chapter V of the data protection regulation contains tools that can be used for transfers to third countries to ensure a level of protection essentially equivalent to that which guaranteed within the EU/EEA. It can e.g. be transfer supported by a decision on adequate level of protection (Article 45) and transfer covered by appropriate protective measures (Article 46). There are also exceptions for special situations (Article 49). In the judgment Schrems II, the Court of Justice of the European Union has annulled that decision on adequacy level of protection that previously applied to the United States. Because a decision on adequate level of protection since July 2020 is missing, transfers to the US may not be based on Article 45. Article 46.1 provides, among other things, that in the absence of a decision in accordance with Article 45.3 a personal data controller or a personal data assistant may only transfer personal data to a third country after taking appropriate safeguards, and on conditions that statutory rights of registered and effective remedies for registered are available. Article 46.2 c stipulates that such suitable safeguards may take the form of standardized data protection regulations adopted by the Commission in accordance with the review procedure referred to in Article 93(2). In the judgment Schrems II, the European Court of Justice did not reject standard contract clauses which transfer tool. However, the court found that they are not binding on the authorities of the third country. The Court of Justice of the European Union stated that “\[even\] if thus 13 Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 in accordance with the European Parliament and Council Directive 95/46/EC on whether adequate protection is ensured by the Privacy Shield in The European Union and the United States and the judgment of the European Court of Justice Facebook Ireland and Schrems (Schrems II), C- 311/18, EU:C:2020:559. Page 14 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 15(23) Date: 2023-06-30 there are situations where the recipient of such a transfer, depending on the legal situation and current practice in the third country concerned, can guarantee the necessary protection of data solely with the support of the standardized data protection regulations, exists the other situations in which the provisions of these clauses cannot be one sufficient means to ensure effective protection of the personal data in practice which is transferred to the third country concerned.' According to the European Court of Justice, this is ""among other things the case when the legislation of the third country allows the authorities of that third country to do interference with the rights of the registered persons regarding these data.” 14 The reason why the European Court of Justice annulled the decision on adequate level of protection with the US was how the US intelligence agencies can access personal data. According to the court, the conclusion of standard contract clauses cannot in itself ensure a level of protection required by Article 44 of the Data Protection Regulation, as the guarantees stated therein do not apply when requested by such authorities access. The European Court of Justice therefore stated the following: ""It thus appears that the standardized data protection regulations which the commission adopted with the support of article 46.2 c of the same regulation only aims to provide the personal data controllers or their personal data assistants established in the Union contractual safeguards that are applied uniformly throughout third countries and thus independent of the level of protection ensured in each of these countries. Because these standardized data protection regulations, with regard to their nature, cannot lead to protective measures that go beyond a contractual obligation to ensure that the level of protection required under Union law is observed, it may be necessary, depending on the situation prevailing in a particular third country, for it personal data controller to take additional measures to ensure that the level of protection observed.15 In the European Data Protection Board's (EDPB) recommendations on the consequences of 16 the judgment clarifies that if the assessment of legislation and practice in the third country involves that the protection that the transmission tool is supposed to guarantee cannot be maintained in practice the exporter must, within the framework of his transfer, as a rule either cancel the transfer or take appropriate additional protective measures. The EDPB thereby notes that ""further measures can only be considered effective in the sense referred to in the EU the court's judgment ""Schrems II"" if and to the extent that they - alone or in combination - addresses the specific deficiencies identified during the assessment of the situation i the third country in terms of its laws and practices applicable to the transfer”. 17 It appears from the EDPB's recommendations that such additional protective measures can fall into three categories: contractual, organizational and technical. 18 Regarding contractual measures, the EDPB states that such measures “\[...\] can supplement and reinforce the safeguards that the transfer tool and relevant legislation in the third country provides \[...\]. Considering that the contractual the measures are of such a nature that they cannot generally bind the authorities in it the third country because they are not parties to the agreement, these measures may often be necessary 14 Paragraphs 125-126. 15 Item 133. 16EDPB, Recommendations 01/2020 on measures that supplement transfer tools to ensure compliance with the EU level of protection of personal data, Version 2.0, adopted on 18 June 2021 (hereinafter ""EDPB's Recommendations 17/2020”). 18EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 75; IMY's translation. EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 52. Page 15 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 16(23) Date: 2023-06-30 combined with other technical and organizational measures to provide it level of data protection required \[...\]'. 19 Regarding organizational measures, the EDPB emphasizes “\[a\]t choose and implement a or more of these measures will not necessarily and systematically ensure that \[a\] transfer meets the basic equivalence standard which required by EU legislation. Depending on the particular circumstances surrounding the transfer and the assessment made by the law of the third country is required organizational measures to supplement contractual and/or technical measures to ensure a level of protection for personal data that is substantially equivalent to that which is guaranteed within the EU/EEA”. 20 Regarding technical measures, the EDPB points out that “these measures will in particular be necessary when the legislation of that country imposes obligations on the importer which contravenes the guarantees in Article 46 of the Data Protection Regulation transfer tools and which in particular may infringe upon the contractual guarantee of one in all essentials equivalent protection against the authorities of the third country gaining access to these 21 tasks"". The EDPB thereby states that ""the measures specified \[in the Recommendations\] are intended to ensure that access to the transmitted data for public authorities in third countries do not interfere with the expediency of the appropriate the safeguards in Article 46 of the Data Protection Regulation transfer tools. These measures would be necessary to guarantee a substantially equivalent level of protection as that guaranteed within the EU/EEA, even if the public ones access by the authorities is consistent with the legislation of the importer's country, where such access in practice goes beyond what is necessary and proportionate in one democratic society. The purpose of these measures is to prevent potentially unauthorized access by preventing the authorities from identifying the registered, drag conclusions about them, point them out in another context or connect the transmitted ones the data to other data sets which, among other things, may contain network identifiers such as provided by the devices, applications, tools and protocols used by registered in other contexts"". 22 2.4.2 The Privacy Protection Authority's assessment 2.4.2.1 Applicable Transfer Tool The investigation shows that Tele2 and Google have entered into standardized agreements data protection regulations (standard contract clauses) in the sense referred to in Article 46 for the transfer of personal data to the United States. These clauses are in line with those which published by the European Commission in decision 2021/914 of June 4, 2021 and thus a transfer tool according to chapter V of the data protection regulation. 2.4.2.2 The legislation and the situation in the third country As can be seen from the judgment Schrems II, the use of standard contract clauses may require additional protective measures as a complement. Therefore, an analysis of the legislation in the relevant third country is made. IMY believes that the analysis that the EU Court has already done in the judgment Schrems II, which relates to similar conditions, is relevant and current, and that it can therefore be added 19EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 99; IMY's translation. 20EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 128; IMY's translation. 21 EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 77; IMY's translation. 22EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 79; IMY's translation. Page 16 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 17(23) Date: 2023-06-30 basis for the assessment in the case without any further analysis of the legal the situation in the United States needs to be done. Google LLC, as the importer of the data to the United States, shall be classified as provider of electronic communications services within the meaning of 50 US Code § 1881 (b)(4). Google is therefore subject to surveillance by American intelligence services in accordance with 50 US § 1881a (“702 FISA”) and thus liable to provide the US government with personal data when 702 FISA is used. The European Court of Justice found in the judgment Schrems II that the American surveillance programs based on 702 FISA, Executive Order 12333 (hereinafter “E.O. 12333”) and Presidential Policy Directive 28 (hereinafter “PPD-28”) in the American legislation does not correspond to the minimum requirements that apply in EU law according to the principle of proportionality. This means that the monitoring programs that are established on these provisions cannot be considered to be limited to what is strict necessary. The court also found that the monitoring programs do not provide the registered rights enforceable against US authorities i court, which means that these people do not have the right to an effective remedy. Against this background, IMY notes that the use of the EU Commission's standard contract clauses are not in themselves sufficient to achieve an acceptable level of protection for the transferred personal data. 2.4.2.3 Additional safeguards implemented by Google and Tele2 The next question is whether Tele2 has taken sufficient additional protective measures. As the personal data controller and exporter of the personal data, Tele2 is obliged to ensure that the rules of the data protection regulation are complied with. This responsibility includes, among other things to assess in each individual case when transferring personal data to third countries which additional safeguards to be used and to what extent, including that evaluate if the actions taken by the recipient (Google) and the exporter (Tele2) taken together are sufficient to achieve an acceptable level of protection. 2.4.2.3.1 Google's additional safeguards Google LLC, as an importer of personal data, has taken contractual, organizational and technical measures to complement the standard contract clauses. In a statement on April 9, 2021, Google described that the company has taken measures. The question is whether the additional protective measures taken by Tele2 and Google LLC are effective, in other words, hindering US intelligence services' ability to obtain access to the transferred personal data. As regards the legal and organizational measures, it can be stated that neither 24 information to users of the Tool (such as Tele2), the publication of a transparency report or a publicly available “Government Request Handling Policy” impedes or reduces the ability of US intelligence agencies to obtain access to the personal data. Furthermore, it is not described what it means to Google LLC's makes a ""careful review of each request"" for the ""legality"" of US intelligence services. IMY notes that this does not affect the legality of 2Items 184 and 192. Item 259 et seq. 2Regardless of whether such notification would even be permitted under US law. Page 17 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 18(23) Date: 2023-06-30 such requests because, according to the European Court of Justice, they are not compatible with the requirements of EU data protection rules. As regards the technical measures taken, it can be stated that neither Google LLC or Tele2 has clarified how the described measures – such as protection of communication between Google services, protection of data during transfer between data center, protection of communications between users and websites or “physical security” – hinders or reduces the ability of US intelligence agencies to prepare access to the data with the support of the American regulatory framework. Regarding the encryption technology used – for example for so-called ""data at rest"" (""data at rest"") in data centers, which Google LLC mentions as a technical measure - has Google LLC as an importer of personal data nevertheless an obligation to grant access to or hand over imported personal data at the disposal of Google LLC, including any encryption keys required to make the data intelligible. Thus such a technical measure cannot be considered effective as long as Google LLC has possibility to access the personal data in plain text. Regarding what Google LLC's stated that ""to the extent information for measurement i Google Analytics transmitted by website owners constitutes personal data, they receive considered to be pseudonymized” it can be stated that universal unique identifiers (UUID) is not covered by the concept of pseudonymisation in Article 4.5 i data protection regulation. Pseudonymization can be a privacy-enhancing technique, but the unique identifiers, as described above, have the specific purpose of distinguishing user and not to act as protection. In addition, individual identifiable genomes are made what is stated above about the possibility of combining unique identifiers and others data (eg metadata from browsers or devices and the IP address) and the ability to link such information to a Google account for logged-in users. Regarding Google's measure ""anonymization of IP addresses"" in the form of truncation 26 it is not clear from Google's response if this action takes place before the transfer, or if the entire IP address is transferred to the USA and shortened only after the transfer to the USA. From from a technical point of view, it has thus not been shown that there is no potential access to the whole The IP address before the last octet is truncated. Against this background, IMY notes that the additional protective measures taken of Google are not effective, because they do not prevent American intelligence services' ability to access the personal data or does so access ineffective. 2.4.2.3.2 Tele2's own additional protective measures Tele2 has stated that the company has taken additional protective measures in addition to those measures which Google has taken. According to Tele2, these consist of activating the function for truncation27 of the last octet of the IP address before the data is transmitted to Google, which means that the last octet is masked. As stated above regarding Google's measures, it is not clear from Google's response whether this action occurs before the transfer or if the entire IP address is transferred to the United States and 25 See EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 81. 26 IP address truncation means that asterisks or zeros replace other digits in the last octets (the last digits of an IP address, a number between 0 and 255). 27 IP address truncation means that asterisks or zeros replace other digits in the last octets (the last digits of an IP address, a number between 0 and 255). Page 18 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 19(23) Date: 2023-06-30 truncated only after the transfer to the United States. From a technical point of view, it has thus not shown that after the transfer there is no potential access to the entire IP address before the last octet is truncated. Even if the truncation were to take place before the transfer takes place, it is not a sufficient one action, as the truncated IP address can be interconnected with others data, as IMY stated above in section 2.2.2. A truncation of an IP address means that only the last octet is masked, which itself can only be any of 256 option (ie in the range 0-255) and due to the truncated IP address going to distinguish from other IP addresses, this information can be combined with others information (as above in section 2.2.2) and enable identification, which in itself is sufficient to determine whether the data together constitute personal data. Although the masking of the last octet constitutes an integrity-enhancing measure, as it limits the extent of the data that authorities can access (in third countries) IMY notes that it is still possible to link the transferred data to other data which is also transferred to Google LLC (in third countries). Against this background, IMY notes that neither the additional measures which taken by Tele2 in addition to the additional measures taken by Google is sufficient effective in preventing US intelligence agencies from accessing the personal data or render such access ineffective. 2.4.2.3.3 The Privacy Protection Authority's conclusion IMY finds that Tele2's and Google's actions are neither individually nor collectively effective enough to prevent US intelligence agencies from obtaining access to the personal data or render such access ineffective. Against this background, IMY finds that neither standard contract clauses nor the others measures invoked by Tele2 may provide such support for the transfer as specified in Chapter V in the data protection regulation. With this transfer of data, Tele2 therefore undermines the level of protection for personal data of data subjects guaranteed in Article 44 of the Data Protection Regulation. IMY therefore notes that Tele2 Sverige AB violated Article 44 i the data protection regulation in any case during the period from 14 August 2020 to and including May 2023. 3 Choice of intervention 3.1 Legal regulation In the event of violations of the data protection regulation, IMY has a number of corrective measures powers to be available according to Article 58.2 a–j of the data protection regulation, among other things reprimand, injunction and penalty fees. IMY shall impose penalty fees in addition to or in lieu of other corrective measures as referred to in Article 58(2), depending on the circumstances of each individual case. Each supervisory authority must ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty charges in each individual case are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The stated in Article 83.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. Page 19 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 20(23) Date: 2023-06-30 In article 83.2 of the data protection regulation, the factors that must be considered in order to decide whether an administrative penalty fee should be imposed, but also at the determination of the amount of the penalty fee. If it is a question of a smaller one breach will receive the IMY as set out in recital 148 instead of imposing a penalty fee issue a reprimand according to article 58.2 b of the regulation. Consideration shall in the assessment, aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the case are taken into account, such as the nature, severity and duration of the breach and previous breaches of relevance. The EDPB has adopted guidelines on the calculation of administrative penalty fees according to the data protection regulation which aims to create a harmonized method and principles 28 for calculation of penalty fees. 3.2 Should a penalty fee be imposed? IMY has found above that the transfers of personal data to the USA that take place via The Google Analytics tool and for which Tele2 is responsible for violations of Article 44 i data protection regulation. Violations of that provision can according to Article 83 incur penalty charges. In light of, among other things, the fact that Tele2 transferred a large amount of personal data, that the processing has been going on for a long time and that the transfer meant that the personal data could not be guaranteed the level of protection given in the EU/EEA is don't ask about a minor infraction. Tele2 must therefore be charged a penalty fee for the established violation. 3.2.1 At what amount should the penalty fee be determined? When determining the maximum amount of a penalty charge to be imposed on a company shall the definition of the concept of company be used as used by the EU Court of Justice application of Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU (see recital 150 i data protection regulation). It appears from the court's practice that this includes every entity that carries out economic activities, regardless of the legal form of the entity and the way of doing so financing as well as even if the unit in the legal sense consists of several physical or legal entities.29 According to Article 83.5 c of the data protection regulation, in the event of a violation of, among other things, article 44 in accordance with 83.2 administrative penalty fees of up to 20 are imposed million EUR or, in the case of a company, of up to 4% of the total global the annual turnover during the previous budget year, depending on which value is the highest. IMY assesses that the company's turnover to be used as a basis for calculation of the administrative sanction fee is Tele2 Sverige AB's annual report for the year 2022. The company had a turnover of approximately SEK 28,102,000,000 during that budget year. The highest penalty amount that can be determined in the case is four percent of this amount, that is say approximately SEK 1,124,080,000. When determining the size of the penalty fee, IMY shall take into account the violation seriousness and taking into account both aggravating and mitigating circumstances 28EDPB's guidelines 8/2020 Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR (adopted for public consultation on 12 May 2022). 29 See Judgment in Akzo Nobel, C-516/15, EU:C:2017:314, paragraph. 48 Page 20 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 21(23) Date: 2023-06-30 determine an administrative sanction amount that is effective in the individual case, proportionate and dissuasive. IMY assesses that the following factors are important for the assessment of the infringement seriousness. As regards the assessment of the seriousness of the infringement, there is initially factors which mean that there are reasons to view the violation more seriously. Tele2 has transferred a large amount of personal data to third countries. The transfer has meant that the personal data has not been able to guarantee the level of protection given in the EU/EES which itself is a serious violation. In addition, it is difficult that the transfer of personal data has been going on for a long time, i.e. as of August 14, 2020 and are still ongoing, and that they have occurred systematically. IMY also considers that now approximately 3 years have passed since the European Court of Justice rejected the 30 the commission's decision on an adequate level of protection in the USA whereby the conditions for transfers of personal data to the United States changed. In the meantime, the EDPB has made recommendations on the consequences of the judgment which was out for public consultation on 10 November 2020 and adopted in final form on 18 June 2021. In addition, several other supervisory authorities within the EU/EEA have issued orders to cease use of the Tool until sufficiently effective safety protection measures have been taken by them personal data controller. The decisions have included cases where the personal data controller has also taken measures such as ""anonymization of IP addresses"" in the form of truncation.31 Although these recommendations and decisions clearly point to the risks of and the difficulties in ensuring a sufficient level of protection for data transfers to companies in the USA, Tele2 has continued to use the Tool during the period of August 14 2020 up to and including at least May 2023 without taking your own additional protective measures. Google's action regarding IP address truncation means that it is still possible distinguish the IP address, as it can be linked with others transmitted data to third countries (to the USA). This enables identification, which means that the data together constitute personal data. Tele2 is one of the major players in the telecom industry in Sweden. It's about data on a large number of data subjects who can be identified indirectly and whose data can be combined with other information about them. As far as the data is concerned nature already follows from Tele2's own purpose for the processing – i.e. to among otherwise be able to draw conclusions about how the data subjects navigate and find their way around The website, that the data aggregated – makes it possible to draw relatively precise conclusions about the privacy of the data subjects and map them, such as regarding what they buy and what services they are interested in over time and holding at the company. Tele2's processing of personal data entails risks of serious infringement 30 Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 according to the European Parliament and the Council directive 95/46/EC on whether adequate protection is ensured by the privacy shield in the EU and the United the states. 31 Austrian supervisory authority (Datenschultzbehörde) decision of 22 April 2022 regarding complaints Google Analytics represented by NOYB with local case number 1354838270, French regulatory authority (CNIL) decision of February 10, 2022 represented by NOYB and the Italian Supervisory Authority (Garante) decision of June 9, 2022 32seeing complaint Google Analytics represented by NOYB, local case number 9782890. Truncation of IP address ""anonymization of IP address"" means that asterisk or zeros replace other digits at the end octets (the last digits of an IP address, a number between 0 and 255), which itself can only be one of 256 options. The effect of this action is that it is still possible to distinguish the IP address from the other IP addresses (255 option), as the IP address can be combined with other transmitted data (e.g. device information and time of the visit) to third countries (to the USA). Page 21 of 23The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11373 22(23) Date: 2023-06-30 of the freedoms and rights of individuals, which gives Tele2s a special responsibility that entails high requirements for transfers to third countries, where IMY overall assesses that Tele2 does not have demonstrated that the company has carried out a sufficient analysis and mapping and has also not taken necessary security measures to limit the risks for the data subjects. IMY notes at the same time that there are factors that speak in the opposite direction. IMY takes into account the particular situation that arose after the judgment and the interpretation of the EDPB's recommendations, where there was a gap after the transfer tool to the United States according to the Commission's previous decision rejected by the European Court of Justice. IMY also considers that Tele2 has taken certain, albeit insufficient, measures to limit them personal data transmitted by activating ""anonymization of IP addresses"" by truncation. Tele2 has done an analysis and mapping of the life cycle for personal data in the Tool. This relationship is also taken into account in the assessment of the seriousness of the violations. Overall, IMY assesses, against the background of the reported circumstances, that they the violations in question are of low seriousness. The starting point for the calculation of the penalty fee should therefore be set low in relation to the current maximum amount. In addition to assessing the seriousness of the violation, IMY must assess whether it exists any aggravating or mitigating circumstances that become relevant the amount of the penalty fee. IMY assesses that there is no further aggravating factor or mitigating circumstances, in addition to those considered in the assessment of the degree of seriousness, which affects the size of the penalty fee. Based on an overall assessment of the aforementioned circumstances, the high turnover in relation to the violations found and in light of the fact that the the administrative penalty fee must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive IMY assesses that the sanction fee can stay at SEK 12,000,000 (twelve million). \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This decision has been taken by the general manager Lena Lindgren Schelin after a presentation by lawyer Sandra Arvidsson.

The Privacy Protection Authority orders with the support of Article 58.2 d i data protection regulation CDON AB to ensure that the company's processing of personal data within the framework of the company's use of the Google Analytics tool complies with Article 44 and other provisions of Chapter V. This shall especially happen by CDON AB ceasing to use that version of the tool Google Analytics as used on August 14, 2020, if not sufficient protective measures have been taken. The measures must be completed no later than one month after this decision gained legal force. IMY decides with the support of article 58.2 and 83 of the data protection regulation that CDON AB shall pay an administrative sanction fee of SEK 300,000 (three hundred thousand) for violation of Article 44 of the Data Protection Regulation. 1 Description of the supervisory matter 1.1 The processing The Swedish Privacy Protection Agency (IMY) has started supervision of CDON AB (below CDON or the company) due to a complaint. The complaint concerns an alleged violation of the provisions of Chapter V of the Data Protection Regulation linked to transfer of the complainant's personal data to third countries. The transfer is alleged to have taken place when the complainant visited the company's website, www.cdon.fi (hereinafter ""the company's website"" or the ""Website"") through the Google Analytics tool (hereinafter the Tool) which provided by Google LLC. The complaint has been handed over to IMY, in its capacity as the responsible supervisory authority according to Article 56 of the Data Protection Regulation. The handover has taken place from the supervisory authority in the country where the complainant has filed his complaint (Austria) in accordance with the regulation's provisions on cooperation in cross-border processing. The proceedings at IMY have taken place through an exchange of letters. Against the background that it applies cross-border treatment, IMY has used the mechanisms for cooperation and uniformity found in Chapter VII of the Data Protection Regulation. Affected supervisory authorities have been the supervisory authorities in Germany, Norway, Estonia, Denmark, Portugal, Spain, Finland and Austria. 1.2 What is stated in the complaint The complaint essentially states the following. 1 regarding the processing of personal data and about the free flow of such data and about the cancellation of avr med directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). Page 3 of 25The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 4(25) Date: 2023-06-30 On August 14, 2020, the complainant visited CDON's website. During the visit, the complainant signed in to his Google account, which is linked to the complainant's email address. CDON had implemented on its website a Javascript code for Google services, including Google Analytics. In accordance with clause 5.1.1 b of the terms of Google's processing of personal data for Google's advertising products and also Google's terms and conditions for processing ""the New Order Data Processing Conditions for Google Advertising Products"" Google processes personal data of the data controller (i.e. CDON) account and must therefore be classified as the company's personal data assistant. During the visit to the company's website, CDON processed the complainant's personal data, at least the complainant's IP address and data collected through cookies. Part of the the data has been transferred to Google. In accordance with clause 10 of the terms of treatment of personal data for Google's advertising products, CDON has approved that Google receives process personal data about the complainant in the United States. Such transfer of data requires legal support in accordance with chapter V of the data protection regulation. According to the judgment of the European Court of Justice Facebook Ireland and Schrems (Schrems II), 2 the company no longer relies on a decision on an adequate level of protection in accordance with Article 45 i data protection regulation for the transfer of data to the United States. CDON should not base the transfer of data on standardized data protection regulations according to article 46.2 c of the data protection regulation if the recipient country does not ensure adequate protection with regard to Union law for the personal data that is transferred. Google shall be classified as a provider of electronic communications services in it meaning referred to in 50 US Code § 1881 (4)(b) and is thus subject to surveillance by US intelligence agencies in accordance with 50 US § 1881a (section 702 i Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, hereinafter “702 FISA”). Google provides it US government with personal data in accordance with these regulations. CDON cannot therefore ensure adequate protection of the complainant's personal data when these are transferred to Google. 1.3 What CDON has stated CDON AB has in opinions on 15 January 2021, 15 February 2022 and 31 August 2022 essentially stated the following. 1.3.1 Who has implemented the Tool and for what purpose, etc. The code for the Tool was embedded on the Website at the time of the complaint and is still embedded on the Website. The decision to embed the Tool on The website was taken over by CDON, a company registered in Sweden. Data is collected from all people who visit the Website, which probably includes registered users from more than one EU/EEA member state. CDON uses the Tool in order to get to know the traffic and uses the Website in order to be able to make various operationally critical decisions. It is with the help of the Tool e.g. possible to find out which product categories are most popular and how customers navigates, partly to find the CDON, partly to complete a purchase. 2 ECJ judgment Facebook Ireland and Schrems (Schrems II), C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559. 3See https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/html/USCODE-2011-title50-chap36-subchapVI- sec1881.htm and https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/html/USCODE-2011-title50-chap36- subchapVI-sec1881a.htm. Page 4 of 25 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 5(25) Date: 2023-06-30 1.3.2 Recipient of the data Within the scope of CDON's use of the Tool on the Website is provided personal data only to Google. 1.3.3 The data processed in the Tool and what constitutes it personal data The information that is processed within the framework of CDON's use of the Tool is various characteristics or actions taken by the visitor on the website, such as: 1. Which elements the user saw when navigating and looking around the website, 2. Clicked on an Image/Banner on the Website, 3. Added or removed something to the shopping cart, 4. Arrived at the checkout or completed a purchase, 5. Clicked on suggestions for accessories on product pages or added something to the wish list, 6. If the user is a member of CDON's customer club, as well as 7. Which search string the user used to search internally on the Website. In addition to this data, Google also gets access to the respective user's IP address. 1.3.4 Categories of persons affected by the processing The categories of persons affected by the processing are all categories of people visiting the Website. CDON does not have any option to distinguish if information about particularly vulnerable persons is processed. This is because CDON only processes anonymous ""behavioral data"" regarding how a user navigates The website. The information processed by CDON is no more than what applies the actual transmission of the information to Google. CDON can neither before nor after the disclosure to Google to identify individual users. What a unique category of person users belong to, CDON is therefore not aware of. 1.3.5 When the code for the Tool is executed and recipients are provided access Immediately after the Website has finished loading in the user's browser, it has transmitted information to Google about where the user is on the Website. Since January 12, 2021, CDON has activated a tool that means that respectively user consent is required for the Tool's content to be integrated and run in the user's browser. 1.3.6 How long the personal data is stored Data and other information are not stored by CDON but are transferred using The real-time tool from CDON to Google. CDON's assessment is that it anonymization of IP addresses described below means the data transferred to Google can no longer be linked to a specific individual and thus is not to be considered as personal data. At Google, personal data is only stored until the IP- 4 the addresses have been truncated. According to information from Google, the truncation is performed as soon as possible it is technically possible 1.3.7 In which countries the personal data is processed The data transferred to the Tool is stored, among other things, in the United States. 4 IP address truncation means that asterisks or zeros replace other digits in the last octets (the last digits of an IP address, a number between 0 and 255). Page 5 of 25 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 6(25) Date: 2023-06-30 1.3.8 CDON's relationship with Google LLC CDON shares the assessment made by Google regarding the distribution of the personal data responsibility, which means that Google is considered to process data within the framework for CDON's use of the Tool as a personal data assistant for CDON. CDON acts as personal data controller. The terms that apply to the Tool are partly Google's terms of use, partly Google's conditions for processing data. The distribution of personal data responsibility agreed by Google and CDON stated in the Google Ads Data Processing Terms. 1.3.9 Ensuring that the processing does not take place for the recipients' own purposes CDON has had no reason to assume that Google does not meet the requirements that follow from the aforementioned Google Ads Data Processing Terms, why Google's compliance with these not yet has been further checked by CDON. 1.3.10 Description of CDON's use of the Tool CDON uses the Tool in order to get to know the traffic on the Website and to be able to make various business-critical decisions based on that information. It's included with the help of the Tool, for example, it is possible to find out which product categories are most popular and how customers navigate the Website to find CDON and for to complete a purchase. 1.3.11 Own checks on transfers affected by the Schrems II ruling As a result of the Schrems II judgment, CDON has taken measures in the form of identifying which of CDON's partners who are located in countries outside the EU/EEA and in relation to the respective cooperation partners requested information about which additional security measures they have taken as a result of the decision. On October 26, 2020, CDON requested information from Google regarding the effect of CDON's embedding of the code for the Tool on the Website. Google has not came back with a response to CDON's request for information and CDON has of this reason, in addition to repeating the request to Google and reminding of answers, searched widely available information about the actions taken by Google as a result of the ruling. According to publicly available information from Google, Google has in addition to the standard contract clauses have taken the following additional safeguards in relation to The tool: • Google ensures a secure transfer of JavaScript libraries and measurement data using the encryption protocol HTTP HSTS (Strict Transport Security). • The tool has been certified according to the internationally accepted independent the safety standards ISO 27001. In addition to these measures, CDON has also chosen to activate IP- anonymization, which means that IP addresses are truncated. The IP anonymization (the truncation) means that the last octet in IPv4 addresses, respectively the last 80 the bits in IPv6 addresses are deleted immediately after the addresses are sent to the collection network for the Tool. Since CDON's view is that it is IP- the addresses that result in other data being collected and transmitted using The tool is to be considered as personal data is CDON's assessment that the truncation Page 6 of 25 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 7(25) Date: 2023-06-30 of the IP addresses means that no information transmitted to Google is considered as personal data after the IP anonymization/truncation has been carried out. 1.3.12 Transfer tool according to chapter V of the data protection regulation Transfers of personal data to recipients in third countries within the framework of CDON's use of the Tool is carried out with the support of the European Commission standard contract clauses (2010/87/EU). In accordance with the versions of Google's terms for the processing of data that have been effective since August 12, 2020, Google and CDON have entered into the EU's standard contractual clauses for the transfer of data from a data controller within the EU to a personal data processor outside the EU, based on the European Commission's template 2010/87/EU. 1.3.13 Control of obstacles to enforcement in legislation in third countries In order to ensure that the contractual obligations in the standard contract clauses are fulfilled have CDON sent the request for information to Google regarding the third country transfer as described above and CDON has not received a response. 1.3.14 What information is covered by the definition of personal data It is important to distinguish between the concepts of being able to distinguish between users and not being able to identify a specific individual. The latter, identification of a specific individual is not the purpose of using the Tool and it is also not possible with that information which is collected by unique identifier(s) (which can be derived to the browser or entity (ie CDON's Google Analytics account ID)) either alone or in combination with, among other things, the information generated when visiting the Website (i.e. Web address (URL) and HTML title of that Web site or information about browser). CDON is of the firm opinion that IP addresses are necessary to, among other things, process the information generated when visiting the Website (ie web address (URL) and HTML title of that Website or information about browser) can be considered to constitute personal data. CDON white words to dynamic IP addresses under certain circumstances may be considered personal data. The distinguishing users made possible by the information collected by however, unique identifier(s) is not sufficient for a specific individual to be able to is identified, with or without aids such as thinning, but it is only in combination with a full IP address as the information collected of unique identifier(s) and information generated when visiting the Website can will constitute personal data. Justices Breyer and M.I.C.M. provides support for the assessment that dynamic IP addresses i all cases are to be regarded as personal data. Dynamic IP addresses according to EU the court must be considered as personal data in relation to the supplier concerned of information or communication services, not in relation to each actor who receives access to an IP address. In the Breyer case regarding the assessment of which aids which can reasonably be used to identify the person in question, the EU Court judged that according to German law there were legal means that make this possible for the provider of electronic information or communication services, that in particular in case of IT attacks, contact the competent authority for action necessary measures to obtain such information from the internet provider and initiate criminal proceedings. It can be questioned about an American authority with a truncated IP address, which can be one of 256 alternative IP addresses, has 5 ECJ judgment Breyer, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779. 6 ECJ judgment M.I.C.M, C-597/19, EU:C:2021:492. Page 7 of 25 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 8(25) Date: 2023-06-30 such legal means as may reasonably be used to enable the identification of a single individual, when in the Breyer case it was even considered problematic with a full IP address relative to the actual provider of the natural person's IT services. 1.3.15 Effectiveness of safeguards taken by Google and CDON Referring to the answers above, CDON, in addition to the activation of IP- the anonymization, not considering the implementation of supplementary measures because Google has informed that additional measures have been taken. The truncation of the IP addresses is an effective protection measure. Regardless of the truncation of The IP addresses occur before, in connection with, or in direct connection with the transfer of the information from CDON to Google. The truncation of the IP addresses means that the information stored on Google's servers in the United States does not constitute personal data. In a situation where the truncation is only carried out when the data has been received by Google LCC, but at the latest in direct connection with the reception, the truncation means that all data that has been transferred by CDON to Google and that is stored on Google's servers will not constitute personal data because the IP address, which is the unique one identifiers which mean that other transmitted information constitutes personal data, has anonymized. IP address without the last octet can be any of 256 alternatives IP addresses and therefore cannot a truncated IP address by thinning together with other information, is considered to constitute personal data. 1.3.16 Additional safeguards taken in addition to those taken by Google During the handling of the case, CDON has thoroughly analyzed and investigated the possibilities to switch to another solution that does not involve the use of the Tool. Coop has made preparations for such a change, which the company should hopefully be able to do execute promptly in case the IMY's final decision involves a finding that The tool is not compatible with the data protection regulation and this gains legal force. The however, it must be emphasized that CDON's analysis shows that such a change will be very burdensome for the company (especially in comparison to other players on the market) why it cannot be implemented before there is clarity in relation to what that applies to the Tool regarding what is a sufficient protective measure. 1.4 What Google LLC has stated IMY has added to the case an opinion from Google LLC (Google) on April 9, 2021 which Google submitted to the Austrian supervisory authority. The statement answers questions which IMY and a number of supervisory authorities have asked Google due to in part joint handling of similar complaints received by these authorities. CDON has been given the opportunity to comment on Google's opinion. By Google's opinion the following appears about the Tool. A JavaScript code is included on a web page. When a user visits (calls) a web page, the code triggers a download of a JavaScript file. Then performed the tracking operation of the Tool, which consists of collecting information related to to the call in different ways and send the information to the Tool's servers. A website administrator who has integrated the Tool on his website can send instructions to Google for processing the data collected. These instructions are transmitted via the so-called tag manager that handles it tracking code that the webmaster has integrated into his website and via Page 8 of 25 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 9(25) Date: 2023-06-30 tag manager settings. Whoever integrated the Tool can do different things settings, for example regarding storage time. The tool also makes it possible for it which integrated it to monitor and maintain the stability of its website, for example by staying informed about events such as peaks in visitor traffic or lack of traffic. The tool also enables a website administrator to measure and optimize the effectiveness of advertising campaigns carried out using other tools from Google. In this context, the Tool collects the visitor's http calls and information about including the visitor's browser and operating system. According to Google, contains one http calls for any page information about the browser and device making the call, such as domain name, and information about the browser, such as type, reference and language. The tool stores and reads cookies in the visitor's browser in order to evaluate the visitor's session and other information about the call. Through these cookies enable the Tool to identify unique users (UUID) over browsing sessions, but the Tool cannot identify unique users in different browsers or units. If a website owner's website has its own authentication system can the website owner use the ID feature, to more accurately identify one users on all the devices and browsers they use to access the website. When the information is collected, it is transferred to the Tool's servers. All data that collected via The tool is stored in the United States. Google has introduced, among other things, the following legal, organizational and technical protective measures to regulate data transfers within the framework of the Tool. Google has taken legal and organizational protective measures such that the company always carry out a thorough examination of a request for access from government authorities on user data can be implemented. It is lawyers/specially trained staff conducting these trials and investigating whether such a request is compliant with applicable laws and Google's guidelines. Those registered are informed the disclosure, unless prohibited by law or would adversely affect one emergency. Google has also published a policy on the company's website about how a such requests for access by governmental authorities of user data shall be implemented. Google has taken technical protective measures such as protecting personal data from interception when transferring data in the Tool. By default using HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which instructs browsers as http to SSL (HTTPS) to use an encryption protocol for all communications between end users, websites and the Tool's servers. Such encryption prevents intruders from passively listen to communications between websites and users. Google also uses an encryption technology to protect personal data, so-called “data in rest"" (""data at rest"") in data centers, where user data is stored on a disk or backup media to prevent unauthorized access to the data. In addition to the above measures, website owners can use IP anonymization through to use the settings provided by the Tool to limit Google's use of personal data. Such settings include above all that in the code for the Tool enable IP anonymization, which means that IP addresses are truncated and contributes to data minimization. If the IP anonymization service is fully used occurs the anonymization of the IP address almost immediately after the request has been received. Page 9 of 25The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 10(25) Date: 2023-06-30 Google also restricts access to the data from the Tool through authorization control as well as by all personnel having undergone training regarding information security. 1.5 CDON's comment on Google's statement CDON maintains what was stated in the opinion of 15 January 2021. In addition to this presents the following to CDON in connection with Google's statement of April 9, 2021. In its use of the Tool, CDON has taken the security measures that the Tool provides. Google's opinion states, among other things, the following: ""As a general matter, unless instructed to do so, Google does not attempt to link data it collects as a processor on behalf of website owners using Google Analytics with data it collects as a controller in relation to its users and the relevant policies and systems are designed to avoid such linking.” Google thus states that the owner of the website has full control over the personal data which Google processes in that there is an opportunity for users of the Tool to give Google special instructions on connecting the personal data with user. CDON has not given Google any such instructions. CDON has instead focused on using the settings as the Tool provides to limit Google's use of personal data. Such settings include, above all, activating IP anonymization in the code of the Tool, which means that IP addresses are truncated. CDON had also limited the storage time for the personal data and has not activated the User-ID function either. So CDON has unable to link a fixed ID for a single user to the user's engagement data from one or more sessions initiated from one or more units. In summary, CDON maintains that the use of the Tool has taken place in accordance with the security measures that the Tool offers. It should also be noted that obligations according to chapter V of the data protection regulation primarily are obligations which is imposed on the exporter, who in this case is CDON's dealer (see EDPB's guidelines 05/2021 and decision of the Austrian data protection authority regarding Google Analytics i target 2021-0.586.257 (D155.027)). 2 Justification of the decision 2.1 The framework for the review Based on the complaint in the case, IMY has only examined whether CDON transfers personal data to the third country USA within the framework of the Tool and if CDON has legal support for it in Chapter V of the Data Protection Regulation. The supervision does not cover if CDON's personal data processing in general is compatible with the data protection regulation. Page 10 of 25The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 11(25) Date: 2023-06-30 2.2 This concerns the processing of personal data 2.2.1 Applicable regulations, etc. In order for the data protection regulation to be applicable, it is required that personal data treated. According to Article 1.2, the Data Protection Regulation aims to protect the data of natural persons fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their right to the protection of personal data. According to Article 4.1 of the regulation, personal data is ""any information relating to a identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as a data subject), whereby a identifiable natural person is a person who can be directly or indirectly specifically identified referring to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, a location data or online identifiers or one or more factors that are specific to the natural person's physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity'. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, one should consider all the aids that, either of it personal data controller or by another person, may reasonably be used to directly or indirectly identify the natural person (reason 26 to data protection regulation). The term personal data can include all information, both objective and subjective information, provided that it ""refers"" to a specific person, which 7 they do if, due to their content, purpose or effect, they are linked to the person. The word ""indirectly"" in Article 4.1 of the Data Protection Regulation indicates that it is not necessary that the information itself makes it possible to identify the registered person for that to be a personal data. Recital 26 of the data protection regulation also states that in order to determine whether a natural person is identifiable, all aids, such as e.g. thinning (""singling out"" in the English language version), which, either of it personal data controller or by another person, may reasonably be used to directly or indirectly identify the natural person, is taken into account. To determine if aids can with reasonable probability be used to identify it the natural person should all objective factors, such as costs and time consumption for identification, taking into account both available technology at the time of processing, considered. It is clear from Article 4.5 of the regulation that pseudymisation is meant processing of personal data in a way that means that the personal data does not longer can be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of supplementary information, provided that this additional information is kept separately and is subject for technical and organizational measures that ensure that the personal data does not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. So-called ""web identifiers"" (sometimes referred to as ""online identifiers"") - e.g. IP addresses or information stored in cookies – can be used to identify a user, especially when combined with other similar types of information. According to recital 30 to data protection regulation, natural persons can be linked to online identifiers provided by their equipment, e.g. IP addresses, cookies or other identifiers. This can leave behind traces that, especially in combination with unique identifiers and other data such as collected, can be used to create profiles of natural persons and identify them. In the Breyer judgment, the European Court of Justice has determined that a person is not considered identifiable through some information about the risk of identification in practice is negligible, which it is 7 ECJ judgment Nowak, C-434/16, EU:C:2017:994, paragraphs 34–35. 8 CJEU judgment Breyer, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph 41. Page 11 of 25 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 12(25) Date: 2023-06-30 identification of the relevant person is prohibited by law or impossible to carry out i practice. However, the European Court of Justice has in the judgment M.I.C.M. from 2021 and in the judgment Breyer struck provided that dynamic IP addresses constitute personal data in relation to the person who processes them, when he also has a legal opportunity to identify the holders of the internet connections using the additional information provided by third parties 10 dispose of. 2.2.2 The Privacy Protection Authority's assessment To determine whether the information processed through the Tool constitutes personal data shall IMY decide whether Google or CDON through the implementation of the Tool can identify individuals, e.g. the complainant, when visiting the Website or about the risk of it is negligible. 11 IMY considers the data processed to be personal data for the following reasons. The investigation shows that CDON implemented the Tool by inserting a JavaScript code (a tag), entered by Google in the source code of the Website. While the page is loaded in the visitor's browser, the JavaScript code from Google LLC's is loaded servers and run locally in the visitor's browser. A cookie is inserted at the same time the visitor's browser and saved on the computer. The cookie contains a text file that collects information about the visitor's operation on the Website. Among other things, a unique identifier in the value of the cookie and this unique identifier is generated and managed by Google. When the complainant visited the Website, or a sub-page of the Website, was transmitted the following information via JavaScript code from the complainant's browser to Google LLC's servers: 1. Unique identifier(s) that identified the browser or device used to visit the Website as well as a unique identifier that identifies the CDON (ie CDON's Google Analytics account ID). 2. Web address (URL) and HTML title of the website and web page that the appellant has visited. 3. Information about browser, operating system, screen resolution, language setting and date and time of access to the Website. 4. Complainant's IP address. During the appellant's visit (according to point 1 above) said identifier was put in cookies with the names ""\_gads"", ""\_ga"" and ""\_gid"" and subsequently transferred to Google LLC. These identifiers have been created with the aim of being able to distinguish individual visitors, such as the appellant. The unique identifiers thus make the visitors to the Website identifiable. Although such unique identifiers (as per 1 above) would not in themselves be considered make individuals identifiable, however, it must be considered that these unique identifiers in it the current case can be combined with additional elements (according to points 2-4 above) and that it is possible to draw conclusions in relation to information (according to the points 2–4 above) which means that information constitutes personal data, regardless of whether the IP address is not transferred in its entirety. 9 CJEU judgment Breyer, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paras 45–46. 10 ECJ judgment M.I.C.M, C-597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraphs 102–104 and Breyer judgment, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph 49. 11 See the Court of Appeal in Gothenburg's judgment of 11 November 2021 in case no. 2232-21, with the agreement of the sub-instance assessment. Page 12 of 25The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 13(25) Date: 2023-06-30 If information is combined (according to points 1–4 above), it means that individual visitors on The site becomes even more distinguishable. It is thus possible to identify individual visitors of the Website. That in itself is enough for it to be considered personal data. It does not require knowledge of the actual visitor's name or physical address, because the differentiation (through the word ""thinning"" in recital 26 i data protection regulation, ""singling out"" in the English version) in itself is sufficient for to make the visitor indirectly identifiable. It is also not required to Google or CDON intends to identify the appellant, but the opportunity to do so is in itself sufficient to determine whether it is possible to identify a visitor. Objective aids such as can reasonably be used either by the personal data controller or by someone other, are all aids that can reasonably be used for the purpose of identifying the appellant. Examples of objective aids that can reasonably be used are access to additional information with a third party that would make it possible to identify the complainant with taking into account both available technology at the time of identification as well as cost (the time required) for the identification. IMY states that the European Court of Justice, through the judgment M.I.C.M. and the Breyer ruling stated that dynamic IP addresses constitute personal data in relation to the person who processes them, when he also has a legal opportunity to identify the holders of the internet connections using the additional information provided by third parties dispose of. IP addresses do not lose their character of being personal data alone due to the fact that the means of identification are with third parties. The Breyer ruling and The M.I.C.M judgment should be interpreted based on what is actually stated in the judgments ie. that about it there is a legal possibility to gain access to supplementary information for the purpose of identify the appellant it is objectively clear that there is a “means which reasonably can will be used' to identify the complainant. According to IMY, the judgments should not be read on the contrary, in the way that a legally regulated possibility to gain access must be demonstrated to data that can link IP addresses to natural persons so that the IP addresses will considered to be personal data. An interpretation of the concept of personal information which means that it must always be demonstrated a legal possibility to link such data to a physical person would, according to IMY, mean a significant limitation of the regulation protection area, and open up possibilities to circumvent the protection in the regulation. This one interpretation would, among other things, be contrary to the purpose of the regulation according to Article 1.2 i data protection regulation. The Breyer judgment was decided under previously applicable directives 95/46 and the concept of ""singling out"" according to recital 26 of the current regulation (that it does not knowledge of the actual visitor's name or physical address is required, because the distinction itself is sufficient to make the visitor identifiable), was not specified in previously applicable directives as a method for identifying personal data. In this context, other information is also added (according to points 1–3 above) such as IP the address can be combined with to enable identification. Google action regarding truncation of an IP address means that it is still possible to distinguish IP- the address, as it can be combined with other data transferred to third country (to the USA). This enables identification, which in itself is sufficient to the data together shall constitute personal data. 12 ECJ judgment M.I.C.M, C-597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraphs 102–104 and Breyer judgment, C-582/14 EU:C:2016:779, paragraph 49. 13 IP address truncation means that asterisks or zeros replace other digits in the last octets (the last digits of an IP address, a number between 0 and 255), which itself can only be one of 256 options. The effect of this action means that it is still possible to distinguish the IP address from the other IP addresses (255 options), because the IP the address can be linked with other transferred data (e.g. information about unit and time of visit) to third country. Page 13 of 25 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 14(25) Date: 2023-06-30 In addition, several other supervisory authorities within the EU/ESS have decided that the transfer of personal data to third countries has occurred when using the Tool because it it has been possible to combine IP addresses with other data (according to points 1–3 above), and thus enabled differentiation of data and identification of IP address, which in itself is sufficient to determine that it is a matter of treatment of 14 personal data. IMY notes that there may also be reasons to compare IP addresses with pseudonymised personal data. Pseudonymization of personal data means according to article 4.5 of the data protection regulation that the data - similar to dynamic IP addresses - cannot be directly attributed to a specific data subject without supplementary data is used. According to recital 26 of the data protection regulation, such data should considered to be information about an identifiable natural person. A narrower interpretation of the concept of personal data would undermine, according to IMY the scope of the right to the protection of personal data, which is guaranteed in Article 8 i The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, because it would make it possible for personal data controllers to specifically single out individuals together with personal data (eg when they visit a certain website) at the same time as individuals are denied the right to protection against the dissemination of such information about them. Such an interpretation would undermine the level of protection for individuals and would not be compatible with the wide scope given by the data protection rules in the practice of the EU Court of Justice. 15 CDON has also, by the appellant being logged in to his Google account at the visit to the Website, processed information where conclusions could be drawn about it individual based on their registration with Google. It appears from Google's statement that implementation of the Tool on a website makes it possible to obtain information about a user of a Google account (ie a registrant) has visited the website in question. Google does state that certain conditions must be met for Google to be able to receive such information, e.g. that the user (complainant) has not deactivated processing and display of personal advertisements. Because the appellant was logged in in their Google account when visiting the Website, Google can therefore still have had the opportunity to receive information about the logged-in user's visits to The website. The fact that it does not appear from the complaint that no personal ads have been shown, does not mean that Google cannot obtain information about the logged in person the user's visit to the Website. IMY finds against the background of the unique identifiers that can identify the browser or the device, the ability to derive the individual through his Google account, they the dynamic IP addresses as well as the possibility to combine these with additional ones information that CDON's use of the Tool on a web page involves processing of personal data. 1Austrian supervisory authority (Datenschultzbehörde) decision of 22 April 2022 regarding complaints Google Analytics represented by NOYB with local case number 1354838270, French regulatory authority (CNIL) decision of February 10, 2022 represented by NOYB and the Italian Supervisory Authority (Garante) decision of June 9, 2022 regarding complaint Google Analytics represented by NOYB, local case number 9782890. 1 See, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice Latvijas Republikas Saeima (Points de pénalité), C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph 61, judgment Nowak, C-434/16, EU:C:2017:994, paragraph 33 and judgment Rijkeboer, C-553/07, EU:C:2009:293, paragraph 59. Page 14 of 25 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 15(25) Date: 2023-06-30 2.3 CDON is the personal data controller for the processing Personal data controller is, among other things, a legal person who alone or together with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (Article 4.7 of the Data Protection Regulation). Personal data assistant is among another, a legal entity that processes personal data for it account of the personal data controller (Article 4.8 of the data protection regulation). The responses provided by CDON show that CDON has made the decision to implement The tool on the Website. Furthermore, it appears that CDON's purpose for this was to the company must be able to analyze how the Website is used, in particular to be able to follow the use of the website over time. IMY finds that CDON by deciding to implement the Tool on the Website i said purpose has established the purposes and means of the collection and it the subsequent transfer of this personal data. CDON is therefore personal data controller for this processing. 2.4 Transfer of personal data to third countries The investigation shows that the data collected via the Tool is stored by Google LLC in the United States. Thus, the personal data collected via the Tool is transferred to the United States. The question is therefore whether CDON's transfer of personal data to the USA is compatible with Article 44 of the Data Protection Regulation and has legal support for it in Chapter V. 2.4.1 Applicable regulations, etc. According to article 44 of the data protection regulation, which has the title ""General principle for transfer of data"", includes the transfer of personal data that is under processing or are intended to be processed after they have been transferred to a third country - i.e. a country outside the EU/EEA - only take place under the condition that it personal data controller and the personal data assistant, subject to others provisions of the data protection regulation, meet the conditions in chapter V. All provisions of said chapter shall be applied to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons ensured by the data protection regulation is not undermined. Chapter V of the data protection regulation contains tools that can be used for transfers to third countries to ensure a level of protection essentially equivalent to that which guaranteed within the EU/EEA. It can e.g. be transfer supported by a decision on adequate level of protection (Article 45) and transfer covered by appropriate protective measures (Article 46). There are also exceptions for special situations (Article 49). In the judgment Schrems II, the Court of Justice of the European Union has annulled that decision on adequacy level of protection that previously applied to the United States. Because a decision on adequate level of protection since July 2020 is missing, transfers to the US may not be based on Article 45. Article 46.1 provides, among other things, that in the absence of a decision in accordance with Article 45.3 a personal data controller or a personal data assistant may only transfer personal data to a third country after taking appropriate safeguards, and on 16 Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 in accordance with the European Parliament and Council Directive 95/46/EC on whether adequate protection is ensured by the Privacy Shield in The European Union and the United States and the judgment of the European Court of Justice Facebook Ireland and Schrems (Schrems II), C- 311/18, EU:C:2020:559. Page 15 of 25The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 16(25) Date: 2023-06-30 conditions that statutory rights of registered and effective remedies for registered are available. Article 46.2 c stipulates that such suitable safeguards may take the form of standardized data protection regulations adopted by the Commission in accordance with the review procedure referred to in Article 93(2). In the judgment Schrems II, the European Court of Justice did not reject standard contract clauses which transfer tool. However, the court found that they are not binding on the authorities of the third country. The Court of Justice of the European Union stated that “\[even\] if thus there are situations where the recipient of such a transfer, depending on the legal situation and current practice in the third country concerned, can guarantee the necessary protection of data solely with the support of the standardized data protection regulations, exists the other situations in which the provisions of these clauses cannot be one sufficient means to ensure effective protection of the personal data in practice which is transferred to the third country concerned.' According to the European Court of Justice, this is ""among other things the case when the legislation of the third country allows the authorities of that third country to do interference with the rights of the registered persons regarding these data.” 17 The reason why the European Court of Justice annulled the decision on adequate level of protection with the US was how the US intelligence agencies can access personal data. According to the court, the conclusion of standard contract clauses cannot in itself ensure a level of protection required by Article 44 of the Data Protection Regulation, as the guarantees stated therein do not apply when requested by such authorities access. The European Court of Justice therefore stated the following: It thus appears that the standardized data protection provisions which the commission adopted with the support of article 46.2 c of the same regulation only aims to provide the personal data controllers or their personal data assistants established in the Union contractual safeguards that are applied uniformly throughout third countries and thus independent of the level of protection ensured in each of these countries. Because these standardized data protection regulations, with regard to their nature, cannot lead to protective measures that go beyond a contractual obligation to ensure that the level of protection required under Union law is observed, it may be necessary, depending on the situation prevailing in a particular third country, for it personal data controller to take additional measures to ensure that the level of protection 18 observed. In the European Data Protection Board's (EDPB) recommendations on the consequences of the judgment clarifies that if the assessment of legislation and practice in the third country involves that the protection that the transmission tool is supposed to guarantee cannot be maintained in practice the exporter must, within the framework of his transfer, as a rule either cancel the transfer or take appropriate additional protective measures. The EDPB thereby notes that ""further measures can only be considered effective in the sense referred to in the EU the court's judgment ""Schrems II"" if and to the extent that they - alone or in combination - addresses the specific deficiencies identified during the assessment of the situation i the third country in terms of its laws and practices applicable to the transfer”. 20 17 18 Paragraphs 125-126. 19 Item 133. EDPB, Recommendations 01/2020 on measures that supplement transfer tools to ensure compliance with the EU level of protection of personal data, Version 2.0, adopted on 18 June 2021 (hereinafter ""EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020”). 20EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 75; IMY's translation. Page 16 of 25 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 17(25) Date: 2023-06-30 It appears from the EDPB's recommendations that such additional protective measures can 21 fall into three categories: contractual, organizational and technical. Regarding contractual measures, the EDPB states that such measures “\[...\] can supplement and reinforce the safeguards that the transfer tool and relevant legislation in the third country provides \[...\]. Considering that the contractual the measures are of such a nature that they cannot generally bind the authorities in it the third country because they are not parties to the agreement, these measures may often be necessary combined with other technical and organizational measures to provide it level of data protection required \[...\]'. 22 Regarding organizational measures, the EDPB emphasizes “\[a\]t choose and implement a or more of these measures will not necessarily and systematically ensure that \[a\] transfer meets the basic equivalence standard which required by EU legislation. Depending on the particular circumstances surrounding the transfer and the assessment made by the law of the third country is required organizational measures to supplement contractual and/or technical measures to ensure a level of protection for personal data that is substantially equivalent to that which is guaranteed within the EU/EEA”. 23 Regarding technical measures, the EDPB points out that “these measures will in particular be necessary when the legislation of that country imposes obligations on the importer which contravenes the guarantees in Article 46 of the Data Protection Regulation transfer tools and which in particular may infringe upon the contractual guarantee of one in all essentials equivalent protection against the authorities of the third country gaining access to these 24 tasks"". The EDPB thereby states that ""the measures specified \[in the Recommendations\] are intended to ensure that access to the transmitted data for public authorities in third countries do not interfere with the expediency of the appropriate the safeguards in Article 46 of the Data Protection Regulation transfer tools. These measures would be necessary to guarantee a substantially equivalent level of protection as that guaranteed within the EU/EEA, even if the public ones access by the authorities is consistent with the legislation of the importer's country, where such access in practice goes beyond what is necessary and proportionate in one democratic society. The purpose of these measures is to prevent potentially unauthorized access by preventing the authorities from identifying the registered, drag conclusions about them, point them out in another context or connect the transmitted ones the data to other data sets which, among other things, may contain network identifiers such as provided by the devices, applications, tools and protocols used by 25 registered in other contexts"". 2.4.2 The Privacy Protection Authority's assessment 2.4.2.1 Applicable Transfer Tool The investigation shows that CDON and Google have entered into standardized agreements data protection regulations (standard contract clauses) in the sense referred to in Article 46 for the transfer of personal data to the United States. These clauses are in line with those which published by the European Commission in decision 2010/87/EU and therefore one transfer tools according to chapter V of the data protection regulation. 21 22EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 52.

Page 17 of 25 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 18(25) Date: 2023-06-30 2.4.2.2 The legislation and the situation in the third country As can be seen from the judgment Schrems II, the use of standard contract clauses may require additional protective measures as a complement. Therefore, an analysis of the legislation in the relevant third country is made. IMY believes that the analysis that the EU Court has already done in the judgment Schrems II, which relates to similar conditions, is relevant and current, and that it can therefore be added basis for the assessment in the case without any further analysis of the legal the situation in the United States needs to be done. Google LLC, as the importer of the data to the United States, shall be classified as provider of electronic communications services within the meaning of 50 US Code § 1881 (b)(4). Google is therefore subject to surveillance by American intelligence services in accordance with 50 US § 1881a (“702 FISA”) and thus liable to provide the US government with personal data when 702 FISA is used. The European Court of Justice found in the judgment Schrems II that the American surveillance programs based on 702 FISA, Executive Order 12333 (hereinafter “E.O. 12333”) and Presidential Policy Directive 28 (hereinafter “PPD-28”) in the American legislation does not correspond to the minimum requirements that apply in EU law according to the principle of proportionality. This means that the monitoring programs that are established on these provisions cannot be considered to be limited to what is strict necessary. The court also found that the monitoring programs do not provide the registered rights enforceable against US authorities i 26 court, which means that these people do not have the right to an effective remedy. Against this background, IMY notes that the use of the EU Commission's standard contract clauses are not in themselves sufficient to achieve an acceptable level of protection for the transferred personal data. 2.4.2.3 Additional safeguards implemented by Google and CDON The next question is whether CDON has taken sufficient additional safeguards. As a personal data controller and exporter of the personal data, CDON is obliged to ensure that the rules of the data protection regulation are complied with. This responsibility includes, among other things to assess in each individual case when transferring personal data to third countries which additional safeguards to be used and to what extent, including that evaluate if the actions taken by the receiver (Google) and the exporter (CDON) taken together are sufficient to achieve an acceptable level of protection. 2.4.2.3.1 Google's additional safeguards Google LLC, as an importer of personal data, has taken contractual, organizational and technical measures to complement the standard contract clauses. In a statement on April 9, 2021, Google described that the company has taken measures. The question is about the additional safeguards taken by CDON and Google LLC are effective, in other words hindering US intelligence agencies' ability to access the transferred personal data. As regards the legal and organizational measures, it can be stated that neither information to users of the Tool (such as CDON), the publication of a 26Items 184 and 192. Item 259 et seq. 27Regardless of whether such a notification would even be permissible under US law. Page 18 of 25 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 19(25) Date: 2023-06-30 transparency report or a publicly available “Government Request Handling Policy” impedes or reduces the ability of US intelligence agencies to obtain access to the personal data. Furthermore, it is not described what it means to Google LLC's makes a ""careful review of each request"" for the ""legality"" of US intelligence services. IMY notes that this does not affect the legality of such requests because, according to the European Court of Justice, they are not compatible with the requirements of EU data protection rules. As regards the technical measures taken, it can be stated that neither Google LLC or CDON has clarified how the described measures – such as protection of communication between Google services, protection of data during transfer between data center, protection of communications between users and websites or “physical security” – hinders or reduces the ability of US intelligence agencies to prepare access to the data with the support of the US regulations. Regarding the encryption technology used – for example for so-called ""data at rest"" (""data at rest"") in data centers, which Google LLC mentions as a technical measure - has Google LLC as an importer of personal data nevertheless an obligation to grant access to or hand over imported personal data at the disposal of Google LLC, including any encryption keys required to make the data intelligible. Thus such a technical measure cannot be considered effective as long as Google LLC has possibility to access the personal data in plain text. Regarding what Google LLC's stated that ""to the extent information for measurement i Google Analytics transmitted by website owners constitutes personal data, they receive considered to be pseudonymized” it can be stated that universal unique identifiers (UUID) is not covered by the concept of pseudonymisation in Article 4.5 i data protection regulation. Pseudonymization can be a privacy-enhancing technique, but the unique identifiers, as described above, have the specific purpose of distinguishing user and not to act as protection. In addition, individual identifiable genomes are made what is stated above about the possibility of combining unique identifiers and others data (eg metadata from browsers or devices and the IP address) and the ability to link such information to a Google account for logged-in users. Regarding Google's measure ""anonymization of IP addresses"" in the form of truncation 29 it is not clear from Google's response if this action takes place before the transfer, or if the entire IP address is transferred to the USA and shortened only after the transfer to the USA. From from a technical point of view, it has thus not been shown that there is no potential access to the whole The IP address before the last octet is truncated. Against this background, IMY notes that the additional protective measures taken of Google are not effective, because they do not prevent American intelligence services' ability to access the personal data or does so access ineffective. 2.4.2.3.2 CDON's own additional safeguards CDON has stated that the company has taken additional protective measures in addition to those actions taken by Google. According to CDON, these consist of activation of 2See EDPB's Recommendations 01/2020, point 81. 2IP address truncation means that asterisks or zeros replace other digits in the last octets (the last digits of an IP address, a number between 0 and 255). Page 19 of 25 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 20(25) Date: 2023-06-30 the function for truncation 30of the last octet in IP address before the data is transferred to Google, which means masking the last octet. 31 As stated above regarding Google's measures, it is not clear from Google's response whether this action occurs before the transfer or if the entire IP address is transferred to the United States and truncated only after the transfer to the United States. From a technical point of view, it has thus not shown that after the transfer there is no potential access to the entire IP address before the last octet is truncated. Even if the truncation were to occur before the transfer, it is not a sufficient measure, because the truncated IP address can be combined with other data, as IMY stated above in section 2.2.2. A truncation of an IP address means that only the last octet is masked, which itself can only be one of 256 options (ie in the range 0-255) and because the truncated IP address is distinguishable from other IP addresses, this data can be combined with other data (according to above in section 2.2.2) and enable identification, which in itself is sufficient to determine if the data together constitute personal data. Although the masking of last the octet constitutes an integrity-enhancing measure, as it limits the scope of de information to which authorities can gain access (in third countries), IMY states that it nevertheless can connect the transferred data to other data that is also transferred to Google LLC (in third countries). Against this background, IMY notes that neither the additional measures which taken by CDON in addition to the additional measures taken by Google is sufficient effective in preventing US intelligence agencies from accessing the personal data or render such access ineffective. 2.4.2.3.3 The Privacy Protection Authority's conclusion The IMY finds that CDON's and Google's actions are neither individually nor collectively effective enough to prevent US intelligence agencies from obtaining access to the personal data or render such access ineffective. Against this background, IMY finds that neither standard contract clauses nor the others measures invoked by CDON may provide such support for the transfer as specified in Chapter V in the data protection regulation. With this transfer of data, CDON therefore undermines the level of protection for personal data of data subjects guaranteed in Article 44 of the Data Protection Regulation. IMY therefore notes that CDON AB is in breach of Article 44 of the data protection regulation. 3 Choice of intervention 3.1 Legal regulation In the event of violations of the data protection regulation, IMY has a number of corrective measures powers to be available according to Article 58.2 a–j of the data protection regulation, among other things reprimand, injunction and penalty fees. 30 IP address truncation means that asterisks or zeros replace other digits in the last octets (the last digits of an IP address, a number between 0 and 255). 31 See above in the section on what CDON has stated, under the heading ""Additional protective measures taken"". Page 20 of 25 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 21(25) Date: 2023-06-30 IMY shall impose penalty fees in addition to or in lieu of other corrective measures as referred to in Article 58(2), depending on the circumstances of each individual case. Each supervisory authority must ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty charges in each individual case are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The stated in Article 83.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. In article 83.2 of the data protection regulation, the factors that must be considered in order to decide whether an administrative penalty fee should be imposed, but also at the determination of the amount of the penalty fee. If it is a question of a smaller one breach will receive the IMY as set out in recital 148 instead of imposing a penalty fee issue a reprimand according to article 58.2 b of the regulation. Consideration shall in the assessment, aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the case are taken into account, such as the nature, severity and duration of the breach and previous breaches of relevance. The EDPB has adopted guidelines on the calculation of administrative penalty fees according to the data protection regulation which aims to create a harmonized method and principles for calculation of penalty fees. 32 3.2 Should a penalty fee be imposed? IMY has found above that the transfers of personal data to the USA that take place via The Google Analytics tool and which CDON is responsible for violations of Article 44 i data protection regulation. Violations of that provision can according to Article 83 incur penalty charges. In light of, among other things, the fact that CDON transferred a large amount of personal data, that the processing has been going on for a long time and that the transfer meant that the personal data could not be guaranteed the level of protection given in the EU/EEA is don't ask about a minor infraction. CDON must therefore be charged a penalty fee for the established violation. See also further below under 3.3 for a detailed description of the seriousness of the violation. 3.2.1 At what amount should the penalty fee be determined? When determining the maximum amount of a penalty charge to be imposed on a company shall the definition of the concept of company be used as used by the EU Court of Justice application of Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU (see recital 150 i data protection regulation). It appears from the court's practice that this includes every entity that carries out economic activities, regardless of the legal form of the entity and the way of doing so financing as well as even if the unit in the legal sense consists of several physical or legal entities. 33 According to Article 83.5 c of the data protection regulation, in the event of a violation of, among other things, article 44 in accordance with 83.2 administrative penalty fees of up to 20 are imposed million EUR or, in the case of a company, of up to 4% of the total global the annual turnover during the previous budget year, depending on which value is the highest. IMY assesses that the company's turnover to be used as a basis for calculation of the administrative sanction fee is CDON's annual report for the year 2022. The company 32EDPB's guidelines 8/2020 Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR (adopted for public consultation on 12 May 2022). 33 See Judgment in Akzo Nobel, C-516/15, EU:C:2017:314, point. 48 Page 21 of 25The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 22(25) Date: 2023-06-30 had a turnover of approximately SEK 461,000,000 during that budget year. This amount is less than 20 million EUR and of this the penalty fee can be determined in an amount of up to 20 EUR million. When determining the size of the penalty fee, IMY shall take into account the violation seriousness and taking into account both aggravating and mitigating circumstances determine an administrative sanction amount that is effective in the individual case, proportionate and dissuasive. IMY assesses that the following factors are important for the assessment of the infringement seriousness. As regards the assessment of the seriousness of the infringement, there is initially factors which mean that there are reasons to view the violation more seriously. CDON has transferred a large amount of personal data to third countries. The transfer has meant that the personal data has not been able to guarantee the level of protection given in the EU/EES which itself is a serious violation. In addition, it is difficult that the transfer of personal data has been going on for a long time, i.e. as of August 14, 2020 and are still ongoing, and that they have occurred systematically. IMY also considers that now approximately 3 years have passed since the European Court of Justice rejected the 34 the commission's decision on an adequate level of protection in the USA whereby the conditions for transfers of personal data to the United States changed. In the meantime, the EDPB has made recommendations on the consequences of the judgment which was out for public consultation on 10 November 2020 and adopted in final form on 18 June 2021. In addition, several other supervisory authorities within the EU/ESS have issued orders to cease use of the Tool until sufficiently effective safety protection measures have been taken by them personal data controller. The decisions have included cases where the personal data controller has also taken measures such as ""anonymization of IP addresses"" in the form of truncation.35 Although these recommendations and decisions clearly point to the risks of and the difficulties in ensuring a sufficient level of protection for data transfers to companies in the US, CDON has not taken its own additional safeguards. Google action 36 regarding IP address truncation means that it is still possible to distinguish IP the address, as it can be combined with other data transferred to third country (to the USA). This enables identification, which means that the data together constitute personal data. CDON's website is also a well-visited e-commerce portal that offers goods from many different suppliers and is available in several countries and in several languages. It's moving on information about a large number of registered persons in the EU/EEA who can be identified indirectly and 3 Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 according to the European Parliament and the Council directive 95/46/EC on whether adequate protection is ensured by the privacy shield in the EU and the United the states. 3Austrian supervisory authority (Datenschultzbehörde) decision of 22 April 2022 regarding complaints Google Analytics represented by NOYB with local case number 1354838270, French regulatory authority (CNIL) decision of February 10, 2022 represented by NOYB and the Italian Supervisory Authority (Garante) decision of June 9, 2022 regarding complaint Google Analytics represented by NOYB, local case number 9782890. 36 Truncation of IP address ""anonymization of IP address"" means that asterisk or zeros replace other digits at the end octets (the last digits of an IP address, a number between 0 and 255), which itself can only be one of 256 options. The effect of this action is that it is still possible to distinguish the IP address from the other IP addresses (255 option), as the IP address can be combined with other transmitted data (e.g. device information and time of the visit) to third countries (to the USA). Page 22 of 25 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2020-11397 23(25) Date: 2023-06-30 whose data can be combined with other data about them. Regarding the nature of the data already follows from CDON's own purpose for the processing – i.e. to, among other things, be able to draw conclusions about how the data subjects navigate and find their way around The website, that the data combined makes it possible to draw relatively precise conclusions about the privacy of the data subjects and map them, such as regarding what they buy and what goods they are interested in over time. CDON's analysis of the Tool shows that there are proposals for a solution other than the Tool, but the company has chosen not to introduce this solution due to the fact that such a change would be particularly burdensome for the company. CDON's processing of personal data entails risks for serious infringement of the freedom and rights of individuals, which gives CDON a special responsibilities that entail high requirements for transfers to third countries, where IMY in total assesses that CDON has not demonstrated that the company has carried out a sufficient analysis and mapping and also has not taken the necessary safety measures to limit the risks of those registered. IMY notes at the same time that there are factors that speak in the opposite direction. IMY takes into account the particular situation that arose after the judgment and the interpretation of the EDPB's recommendations, where there was a gap after the transfer tool to the United States according to the Commission's previous decision rejected by the European Court of Justice. IMY also considers that CDON has taken certain, albeit insufficient, measures to limit them personal data transmitted by activating ""anonymization of IP addresses"" by truncation. This relationship is also taken into account in the assessment of the seriousness of the violations. Overall, IMY assesses, against the background of the reported circumstances, that they the violations in question are of low seriousness. The starting point for the calculation of the penalty fee should therefore be set low in relation to the current maximum amount. There are also reasons to ensure a proportional penalty fee in the individual case already at this stage to further adjust the starting point for the continued calculation downwards taking into account the turnover that is the basis for the calculation of the penalty fee. In addition to assessing the seriousness of the violation, IMY must assess whether it exists any aggravating or mitigating circumstances that become relevant the amount of the penalty fee. IMY assesses that there is no further aggravating factor or mitigating circumstances, in addition to those considered in the assessment of the degree of seriousness, which affects the size of the penalty fee. Based on an overall assessment of the said circumstances and against the background that the the administrative penalty fee must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive IMY assesses that the penalty fee can stay at 300,000 (three hundred thousand) kroner. 3.3 Other interventions In light of the established violation, IMY makes the assessment that CDON must ordered according to article 58.2 d of the data protection regulation to ensure that the company's processing of personal data within the framework of the company's use of the tool Google Analytics complies with Article 44 and other provisions of Chapter V. This shall be done in particular by ceasing to use that version of the tool 37Austrian supervisory authority (Datenschultzbehörde) decision of 22 April 2022 regarding complaint Google Analytics represented by NOYB with local case number 1354838270, French regulatory authority (CNIL) decision of February 10, 2022 represented by NOYB and the Italian Supervisory Authority (Garante) decision of June 9, 2022 regarding complaint Google Analytics represented by NOYB, local case number 9782890.

The Privacy Protection Authority decides with the support of articles 58.2 and 83 i data protection regulation that Trygg-Hansa Försäkring filial must pay an administrative penalty fee of SEK 35,000,000 (thirty-five million) for the violation of articles 5.1 f and 32.1. Account of the supervisory matter Background In December 2020, the Swedish Privacy Agency (IMY) received tips that Moderna Försäkringar, branch of Tryg Forsikring A/S (Moderna Försäkringar) had made it possible access by unauthorized persons to personal data that concerned data of sensitive character of Moderna Försäkringar's customers. In March 2021, IMY began supervision of Moderna Försäkringar in order to review whether Moderna Försäkringar had taken appropriate measures to ensure a level of security that was appropriate in relation to the risk of personal data processing, in accordance with articles 5.1 f and 32 i data protection regulation. As part of its review, IMY has taken note of the 16 documents that the tip refers to. The is a question of several different types of insurance documents, including claims, Postal address: invoices, insurance letters, insurance decisions, response cards regarding insurance compensation, Box 8114 scope change and request for additional information for insurance investigation. 104 20 Stockholm The documents contain a large number of categories of personal data, such as e.g. name, Website: contact details, health details, social security number, financial details, www.imy.se insurance holdings, sequence of events (for example time, place, actions and others E-mail: imy@imy.se 1 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with Telephone: regarding the processing of personal data and on the free flow of such data and on the cancellation of 08-657 61 00 directive 95/46/EC (general data protection regulation). Data Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-1905 2(12) Date: 2023-08-28 information provided by the data subject in free text fields) and information regarding ownership and property damage. In April 2022, Moderna Försäkringar merged with Trygg-Hansa. Modern Försäkringar subsequently changed its name to Trygg-Hansa branch (Trygg-Hansa) but continued to operate under the same organization number as before (516403-8662). In the decision, IMY will consistently use the supervised object's new name, Trygg- Hansa, when explaining what happened. Statement from the subject of supervision Trygg-Hansa has essentially stated the following. On November 30, 2020, Trygg-Hansa was contacted by a person by phone who informed of the deficiency. The recipient of the tip at Trygg-Hansa did not understand that it was a possible incident, and the deficiency was therefore not reported further within Trygg-Hansa's organization. The security breach has occurred in the following way: 1. An existing or new potential customer has contacted customer service by phone and wanted to get a quote for insurance. The customer service manager has after ended phone call sent an SMS or e-mail to the customer. 2. The SMS or email has contained a unique web address to a quote page on Trygg-Hansa's website. 3. On the quote page there have been clickable links with URLs leading to documents with insurance information. The person who contacted Trygg- Hansa as above has been able to open the documents by clicking on the links. 4. These documents have had web addresses which at the time could be modified by the person in their browser by replacing numbers with other numbers. On in this way, the person has been able to retrieve other customers' documents. There has been internet access to data on approximately 650,000 customers during the period October 2018 up to and including when IMY contacted the company at the end of February 2021. The information covered is name, social security number, contact information (address, e-mail address, phone number), insurance number, claims number, financial information, health information, insurance holdings, ownership information (such as animal ownership, vehicle details, property details), property damage (such as details about workshop, notice of compensation), sequence of events (for example time, place, actions and other information that the data subject provided in free text fields) and other free text fields. It can it cannot be ruled out that there was also information about violations of the law (such as in connection with claims) or information about membership of a trade union (such as when insurance has been taken out with a trade union). Analysis of behavioral patterns in logs indicates that 202 customers are likely direct concerned in such a way that information about them (documents) may have been shown to someone unauthorized. As far as Trygg-Hansa has been able to ascertain, after examining the logs, it is only the tipster and IMY who gained access to the documents. In order to similar security flaws would not arise, Trygg-Hansa had taken before the event in question measures by drawing up an IT security policy, implementing regular penetration tests and logging on nodes, transactions and customer management systems as well as by holding an annual training in data protection and security and ongoing Date: 2023-08-28 training for employees with special responsibility for data protection issues. Trygg Hansa follows the ISO 27001 standard, which i.a. involves continuous penetration testing and segmentation of networks. Trygg-Hansa did not carry out an impact assessment concerning the treatment in question before the treatment began. This had, however carried out if the personal data processing started today because Trygg-Hansa nowadays have routines for this. Since approximately the middle of 2019, Trygg implements Hansa a compliance system that Trygg-Hansa describes in a structured way processes, data, storage, contracts, suppliers, etc. along with impact assessments. In order to access documents with information about other customers, according to Trygg- Hansa required knowledge of the structure of Internet addresses and how to take part in it the underlying content with, for example, a browser. Furthermore, it has been required changing part of the URL digits in the Document ID. Since the incident in question has been identified, Trygg-Hansa has taken further steps security measures, such as addressing the current flaw by encrypting and ensure that access can only take place by someone who is authorized. After the event identified, Trygg-Hansa has also carried out two independently of each other penetration tests by two different external security companies, updated IT the security policy, took measures to improve the procedures for testing activities, decided to establish an architecture council with security control and code review at development, reviewed the internal customer complaint process and decided to implement additional training for employees in customer service as well as for developers and testers. Trygg-Hansa has also contacted registered persons by letter, and in some cases by telephone, for to inform about what happened and informed on its website. Justification of the decision Has Trygg-Hansa ensured an appropriate security level for the personal data? Applicable regulations According to article 5.1 f of the data protection regulation, the personal data controller must process the personal data in a way that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unauthorized processing and against loss, destruction or damage by accident, using appropriate technical or organizational measures measures (integrity and confidentiality). According to article 9.1 of the data protection regulation, it is prohibited as a starting point to process special categories of personal data (so-called sensitive personal data), including information about health. In Article 9.2 certain exceptions are specified from the ban. It follows from Article 32.1 of the Data Protection Regulation that the person in charge of personal data shall take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a safety level that is appropriate in relation to the risk of the treatment. It shall, according to the same provision, take into account the latest developments, the implementation costs and the nature, extent, context and purpose and the risks, of varying degree of probability and seriousness, for physical rights and freedoms of persons. When assessing the appropriate level of security, the Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-1905 4(12) Date: 2023-08-28 according to article 32.2, special consideration is given to the risks that the processing entails, i in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or to unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data transmitted, stored or on otherwise treated. The Swedish Privacy Protection Authority's assessment Trygg-Hansa is responsible for personal data Trygg-Hansa has stated that Trygg-Hansa is responsible for personal data for them personal data processing that the tip intended, which is supported by the investigation i the case. IMY assesses that Trygg-Hansa is the personal data controller for that processing which the supervision covers. The treatment involved major privacy risks and required a high level of protection The person in charge of personal data must provide security that is suitable from the outside the risks of the treatment. The assessment of the appropriate level of protection must be done with taking into account, among other things, the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing as well as the risks, of varying degrees of probability and seriousness, for natural persons rights and freedoms. During the assessment, special consideration must be given to the risks that the processing entails, among other things, unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data. IMY notes that the processing of personal data has included a large number registered within Trygg-Hansa's core business. According to Trygg-Hansa's own information has been a question of data on approximately 650,000 customers. IMY further states that the processing intended a large number of personal data about each registered, which enabled mapping of individuals' personal circumstances. The 16 documents that IMY has seen within the framework of the supervisory case contain a large number categories of personal data, such as names, contact details, health details, social security number, financial information, insurance holdings, sequence of events (e.g. time, place, actions and other information provided by the data subject free text field) and information regarding ownership and property damage. Trygg-Hansa also has presented that it cannot be ruled out that information about violations of the law or information about membership in a trade union. Through access to a document, it has been possible to directly read out a large number information about an individual person. Thus, in some cases it has been possible to get a detailed picture of the personal circumstances of the registered person using the documents. The comprehensive the processing of personal data has been particularly sensitive to privacy through use of social security numbers and other identification data that enabled a clear and direct connection to individuals. IMY further assesses that the nature of the personal data in itself entails a high risk. The documents have contained sensitive personal data, i.a. information about health, such as according to the main rule in Article 9.1 of the data protection regulation may not be processed. Such data have been given extended protection, as processing them may constitute a extremely serious interference with the fundamental rights regarding respect for 2 privacy and protection of personal data. The data on health has also had a 2 The judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in case C‑184/20, Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisija, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph 126. The Swedish Data Protection Authority Diary number: DI-2021-1905 5(12) Date: 2023-08-28 high level of detail, so that, for example, it was possible to determine how a health problem arose or exactly what health condition it is, which meant an even higher risk. The material has also contained other types of information that are particularly worthy of protection. This applies, among other things, to information about social security numbers that are covered by a special protection according to article 87 of the data protection regulation and ch. 3 Section 10 of the Act (2018:218) with supplementary regulations to the EU data protection regulation. According to Trygg-Hansa can it is also not excluded that there was information about legal offenses that are covered of a strong protection according to Article 10 of the Data Protection Regulation, because processing of they can have serious effects on individuals. There have also been reports of individuals' financial conditions. The documents in the case also show that it has been possible for registered users to provide information in forms themselves. In some claims, the registrants have provided detailed information in running text regarding health problems and how injuries occurred. By giving Trygg-Hansa the opportunity to provide information in running text has it has been difficult for Trygg-Hansa to fully control the content and the types of information that appears. This has resulted in special requirements for handling the documents on a safe way. Overall, the large number of registrants has the extensive amount of data if each person and the sensitive nature of the data entailed a high risk of rights and freedoms of natural persons. Unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data has been able to lead to serious consequences for those concerned the persons. This has led to demands for a high level of protection for the treatment. IMY further states that the context for the processing of personal data entailed a even higher requirements on the level of protection. Personal data processing has taken place within the framework for Trygg-Hansa's core business. In addition, the registrants are entitled expectations of a high degree of confidentiality and robust protection against unauthorized access access to personal data processed in insurance operations. The data have further collected in order to be able to make assessments and make decisions regarding registered, which is a type of processing of personal data that may involve higher risks and require higher protection. In summary, the treatment has been of such a nature that high demands have been placed on it the security of the data, for example through authorization control, encryption, logging, access control and management of technical vulnerabilities. The data has not been adequately protected IMY must then assess whether Trygg-Hansa has ensured the high level of protection that required. IMY states that it has not been required that the person who prepared access to the data verified their identity for Trygg-Hansa or otherwise verified their authorization to receive access to these. Anyone who has had access to the web addresses has thus been able to visit the websites and thereby gain access to the documents with personal data without ensuring that it was an authorized person. The data in 3 The Council of Europe has stated in a recommendation that member states must ensure that employees of insurance companies who receive access to personal data must be subject to rules on confidentiality (Recommendation rec\[2002\]9 on the protection of personal data collected and processed for insurance purposes). See also prop. 2009/10:241 p. 43 and Ds 2011:7. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2021-1905 6(12) Date: 2023-08-28 nor have the documents been protected by encryption, but have been available in plain text. Furthermore, there has been a question of data that directly identified individuals, i.e. the data has not been protected by pseudonymisation. Trygg-Hansa has thus done a large amount of direct personal data of a privacy-sensitive nature available on internet without taking protective measures in the form of authorization control or encryption. Trygg-Hansa has stated that special knowledge is required to access documents with personal data via the web addresses. However, IMY has observed through the documents and web addresses in the case that it has been possible to access documents by changing the last digits of the URLs. In some cases they have first six digits out of eight have been the same in the different URLs, which means that few numbers in these cases have had to be changed for unauthorized access document. It has also been possible to forward the URLs, which lead to unprotected information about policyholders, to other unauthorized persons. These people have in their luckily, without having to change any numbers, was able to access the information in the documents only by clicking on the URL. That in some cases it was required that an individual changed numbers in the web address field to access documents does not mean that Trygg- Hansa has taken appropriate measures, for example authentication and authorization control, for to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing the relevant information. IMY has been able to access information in the documents without hindrance, simply by visiting the URLs and without having to change the address bar of the browser. Against this background, IMY notes that Trygg-Hansa made a large amount privacy-sensitive personal data accessible in plain text on the internet. It has not been required some authentication to ensure that only the right people could access the data. Persons who obtained or prepared unauthorized access to the dispatches the URLs – or manipulated versions of the sent URLs – has thus been able to gain access to the privacy-sensitive personal data. Based on these circumstances, IMY makes the assessment that there were major deficiencies in the protection of the data. The investigation also shows that the deficiencies have led to unauthorized access access to the data. IMY notes that Trygg-Hansa's own logs indicate that 202 customers likely to have been directly affected in such a way that their data may have been shown to someone unauthorized. However, it should be emphasized that the fact that it has been easy for unauthorized to prepare access to a large amount of personal data of the subject the battle itself is a serious flaw, regardless of how many instances of unauthorized use occurred access that has been possible to ascertain. The shortcomings have been of such a fundamental nature that Trygg-Hansa should have detected and fixed them before the system was implemented. Trygg-Hansa has, however, introduced the system with the flaws, nor during the long period in which the system was used able to identify and remedy them. This despite the fact that Trygg-Hansa received information about the shortcomings through a tip from the outside. IMY further states that the processing of personal data is part of the insurance company's core business and that Trygg-Hansa should therefore have had a good ability to ensure a security that was suitable from the outside the scope and sensitivity of the treatment. Overall, IMY assesses that Trygg-Hansa has not taken appropriate technical measures measures to ensure a level of security that is appropriate in relation to the risk. Trygg-Hansa has thus processed personal data in violation of article 32.1 of the Swedish Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-1905 7(12) Date: 2023-08-28 data protection regulation. That a large amount of personal data, including sensitive data, for a longer period of time has been processed in a way that entailed a risk of unauthorized access access means, according to IMY, that the lack of security was of such a serious nature that it also involves a violation of Article 5.1 f of the data protection regulation. Choice of intervention Legal regulation If there has been a breach of the data protection regulation, IMY has a number corrective powers to be available according to Article 58.2 of the Data Protection Regulation. It follows from Article 58.2 of the data protection regulation that IMY in accordance with Article 83 shall impose penalty charges in addition to or in lieu of other corrective measures which referred to in Article 58(2), depending on the circumstances of each individual case. Each supervisory authority must ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty charges in each individual case are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The stated in Article 83.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. In Article 83.2, the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether an administrative penalty fee must be imposed, but also what will affect the penalty fee size. Important for the assessment of the seriousness of the violation is, among other things, its nature, severity and duration. According to Article 83.4, in the event of violations of, among other things, Article 32, it must be imposed administrative penalty fees of up to EUR 10,000,000 or, if one applies company, of up to 2% of the total global annual turnover in the previous year budget year, depending on which value is the highest. According to Article 83.5, in the event of violations of, among other things, Article 5, it must be imposed administrative penalty fees of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, if one applies company, of up to 4% of the total global annual turnover in the previous year budget year, depending on which value is the highest. If it is a question of a minor violation, IMY receives according to what is stated in reason 148 i instead of imposing a penalty charge, issue a reprimand in accordance with Article 58.2 b i the regulation. IMY's assessment A penalty fee must be imposed IMY has made the assessment that Trygg-Hansa has processed personal data in violation of article article 32.1 and that the violation is of such a serious nature that it is also question of a violation of the principle of integrity and confidentiality in Article 5.1 f. The violation has occurred through Trygg-Hansa processing personal data with a insufficient level of security, which has entailed the risk that unauthorized persons could obtain access to approximately 650,000 customer data during the period October 2018 to and including with February 2021. The personal data has, among other things, made up of sensitive personal data and social security number, and unauthorized access to these data entails a high risk of the freedoms and rights of the data subjects. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2021-1905 8(12) Date: 2023-08-28 IMY does not consider it to be a question of less serious violations. Trygg-Hansa will therefore, an administrative penalty fee is imposed for the violations. When deciding of the amount of the sanction fee, IMY must take into account the circumstances stated in article 83.2 and ensure that the administrative penalty fee is effective, proportionate and discouraging. The parent company's annual turnover must be used as the basis for the calculation When determining the maximum amount of a penalty charge to be imposed on a company shall the definition of the concept of company be used as used by the EU Court of Justice application of Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU (see recital 150 i data protection regulation). It appears from the court's practice that this includes every entity that carries out economic activities, regardless of the legal form of the entity and the way of doing so financing as well as even if the unit in the legal sense consists of several physical or legal entities. What constitutes a company must therefore be based on the definitions of competition law. The rules for group liability in EU competition law revolve around the concept economic unit. A parent company and a subsidiary company are considered part of the same economic unit when the parent company exercises decisive influence over the subsidiary. The decisive influence (ie control) can be achieved either through ownership or by agreement. Jurisprudence shows that one hundred percent or almost 100% ownership implies a presumption that control is deemed to exist. However, the presumption can be rebutted if the company provides sufficient evidence that proof that the subsidiary acts independently on the market. To refute the presumption, the company must therefore provide evidence relating to the organizational, the financial and legal links between the subsidiary and its parent company which shows that they do not constitute an economic unit even though the parent company owns 100 percent 5 or almost 100 percent of the shares. Trygg-Hansa is a branch of the Danish company Tryg Forsikring A/S. Tryg Forsikring A/S is in turn a wholly owned subsidiary of Tryg A/S (""Tryg""). According to the one described above the presumption is therefore Tryg's turnover that must be used as a basis for calculation of the maximum penalty fee amount. To depart from the presumption it is required that Trygg-Hansa provides sufficient evidence that another turnover must be added basis for the calculation. Trygg-Hansa has stated that it is the part of Tryg's turnover that corresponds the turnover of Moderna Försäkringar which should be used as a basis for the calculation of the maximum penalty fee. Trygg-Hansa has estimated this turnover to 2,406,294,859 Danish kroner. Secondly, Trygg-Hansa believes that the maximum the penalty fee should be based on Modern Insurance and Tryg's turnover, whereby the turnover of the companies that have been acquired by Tryg after the time period which the review should be excluded from the calculation of the penalty fee. Trygg Hansa has estimated this turnover at 23,622,304,333 Danish kroner. IMY has understood Trygg-Hansa's approach so that the maximum sanction fee i primarily should be calculated on the hypothetical turnover as the branch Moderna Insurance would have had during 2022 if not for Trygg-Hansa and Moderna Insurances had merged in April 2022. Furthermore, IMY has understood that Trygg-Hansa 4 Case C-97/08, para. 59-61 5 Cf. EDPB's guidelines Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR, point 125 and where reported rulings. Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-1905 9(12) Date: 2023-08-28 secondarily believes that it is Tryg in the organization that applied when the deficiency existed, i which Moderna Försäkringar is included, which constitutes the financial unit on which a maximum penalty fee must be calculated. In determining the relevant the annual turnover for Tryg must thus be the estimated turnover for the companies that acquired after the time of infringement is exempted. In support of his view, Trygg-Hansa has stated in summary that Moderna Insurance at the time of the review was seen as an independent business from Tryg in technical and organizational terms. Trygg-Hansa has thereby highlighted i mainly the following. Moderna Försäkringar was a branch only for tax reasons. Moderna Försäkringar decided independently on its actions and had its own management team. The server environment where the current personal data processing took place was run and developed by Moderna Försäkringar which also had its own IT manager and IT organization. Only customers of Moderna Försäkringar are affected in this matter. The personal data processing reviewed in the case was also not sanctioned by Tryg and the insurance systems for the two businesses were different and separate from each other without any logical, organizational or technical connection. According to Trygg Hansa, the turnover of the acquired companies should under all circumstances are excluded from Tryg's turnover when determining the maximum sanction amount then the responsibility for an infringement according to competition law practice must be attributed to the one who had controlling influence over the business at the time of the incident. IMY makes the following assessment. Trygg-Hansa is a branch of Tryg Forsikring A/S, and is thus not an independent legal person. Trygg-Hansa's turnover is included as one integral part of Tryg's total turnover, and is fully integrated with the turnover for Tryg Forsikring A/S. These circumstances strongly suggest that Trygg-Hansa, Tryg Forsikring A/S and Tryg must be regarded as one and the same financial entity. The circumstances that Trygg-Hansa highlighted that the branch, when it went under the name Moderna Försäkringar, had its own management team, IT system and IT organization not something which in itself contradicts the fact that it is a question of one and the same economic unit. Overall, IMY assesses that there is no reason to deviate from the presumption that is Tryg's turnover that must be added to the calculation of the maximum the penalty fee. What does Trygg-Hansa's attitude mean that the turnover of the acquired companies should is excluded from the calculation of the maximum amount of the sanction fee, IMY does the following assessment. At the time of the infringement, Trygg-Hansa was, as it is today, another branch Safe. There have therefore been no organizational changes that in themselves have an impact the liability relationship between the branch and the company. It may further be noted that the fact that the relevant annual turnover for the calculation of the penalty fee is that annual turnover determined in the year immediately preceding that of the supervisory authority decision can mean that major changes in the annual turnover have taken place since then the time of the violation, both decreases and increases. Such changes may be due to business events, such as increasing or decreasing market share and profitability, or changes to the company's organization, such as sales or acquisition of companies. There is, to a certain extent, the possibility of taking such into account changes within the framework of the proportionality assessment that must always be made at imposition of penalty charges under the Data Protection Regulation to ensure that the sanction fee imposed is proportional in the individual case. IMY assesses on the other hand, that the maximum penalty fee amount should be based on the determined amount the annual turnover, without deduction for hypothetical amounts for the companies that have been acquired during this time period. The Swedish Data Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-1905 10(12) Date: 2023-08-28 However, IMY takes into account both the fact that the violation occurred in a limited part of Trygs activities that the organizational changes Trygg-Hansa has highlighted, within the framework for the proportionality assessment, which is reported below under the heading ""The penalty fee must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive"". IMY assesses overall that the turnover of the company to be used as a basis for calculation of the administrative penalty fees that Trygg-Hansa can impose is Guaranteed turnover. From Tryg's annual report for the year 2022, it appears that the annual turnover in 2022 was approx. 33,938,000,000 Danish kroner, which corresponds to approx. 54,000,000,000 6 Swedish crowns. The maximum penalty amount that can be determined in the case is four percent of this amount, i.e. approximately SEK 2,160,000,000. The seriousness of the violation IMY makes the following considerations regarding the seriousness of the violation. That there was one possible unauthorized access to approximately 650,000 customers' data implies that there was a risk to a high number of people. The data has included sensitive personal data, such as health data, and other data of a privacy-sensitive nature, such as social security number and financial information. It cannot be ruled out that information about violations of the law have been revealed. The personal data processing has meant significant risks. Individuals were directly identifiable, which meant that information of a sensitive nature could be linked to identified persons. The data have processed in a context where the data subjects have legitimate expectations of a high level of confidentiality and robust protection against unauthorized access. The data has been collected in order to be able to make assessments and make decisions regarding registered, which is a type of processing of personal data that may involve higher risks and require higher protection. Information about, for example, ownership, which would could entail a risk of theft, could easily be linked to names in case of unauthorized access and address. Due to the nature of the information, and since the documents contained a numerous collected data, any unauthorized access has meant a high risk of damaged reputation and loss of confidentiality. Trygg-Hansa's analysis of behavior patterns in logs indicate that 202 customers are likely to be directly affected by so way that information about them in documents may actually have been shown to unauthorized persons, and IMY states that unauthorized access occurred on at least one occasion, in connection with the tip about shortage was given to IMY. The violation has also continued for a longer period of time, between October 2018 and time when IMY contacted Trygg-Hansa and pointed out the deficiency in February 2021. Trygg- Hansa received information about the shortcomings in November 2020 through an external tip the security that could have been used to remedy the deficiencies and thereby reduce privacy risks for individuals. However, Trygg-Hansa was unable to use it the information to remedy the deficiencies. The violation has concerned Trygg-Hansa core business, where Trygg-Hansa can be assumed to have knowledge of risks and requirements for the protection of personal data. It appears from the EDPB's guidelines that the supervisory authority must assess whether the violation is of low, medium, or high severity.7 IMY has established that the violation is so serious that it also constitutes a violation of the fundamental principle of integrity and confidentiality according to Article 5.1 f i 6 Based on the exchange rate on 23 August 2023, published on riksbanken.se 7 EDPB's guidelines Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR, point 60. Data Protection Authority Diary number: DI-2021-1905 11(12) Date: 2023-08-28 data protection regulation, which means that the maximum sanction fee is 4 percent of the annual turnover instead of the 2 percent that applies in case of violation of article 32. Overall, IMY assesses that the violation in question has a medium level degree of seriousness within the range of violations of Article 5.1 f data protection regulation. Trygg-Hansa has taken a number of measures before and after the deficiencies were identified. Trygg-Hansa has, among other things, had two carried out independently of each other penetration tests by two different external security companies and initiated measures in order to improve routines for testing activities. Trygg-Hansa has also decided to establish one architecture board with security control and code review during development, decided to implement additional training for employees in customer service as well as for developers and tester. Trygg-Hansa has also provided certain information to registered users about it occurred. This and other measures described by Trygg-Hansa were carried out however, after IMY contacted the company to inform about the deficiency, and does not go beyond what can be expected. The measures are not of such a nature that they affect IMY's assessment in the case in a mitigating direction. The penalty fee must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive The administrative penalty fee must be effective, proportionate and deterrent. This means that the amount must be determined so that the administrative the penalty fee leads to correction, that it provides a preventive effect and that it in addition, is proportionate in relation to current violations as well as to the supervised entity's ability to pay. In the proportionality assessment, IMY considers that Tryg's annual turnover has increased significant due to the acquisition of companies that were not included in the company's total turnover at the time of the infringement. In addition, IMY attaches great importance to the fact that the violation, as revealed in the matter, only happened in the Swedish branch. To be based solely on the group's turnover in this case, where the violation affected a limited part of the business, would result in the penalty fee being set far too high in relation to what has occurred. IMY therefore sees reason that in a proportionality assessment, taking it into account turnover for Moderna Försäkringar as reported by Trygg-Hansa, determine the penalty fee to a significantly lower amount than an assessment solely based on Tryg's turnover had resulted in IMY decides based on an overall assessment that Trygg-Hansa must pay a administrative sanction fee of SEK 35 million.

The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection issues Trionic Sverige AB a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR for the infringement of Articles 6(1) and 13(1)(e) of the GDPR. Presentation of the supervisory case The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) has initiated supervision regarding Trionic Sverige AB (Trionic or the company) due to a complaint. The complaint has been submitted to IMY, as responsible supervisory authority for the company’s operations pursuant to Article 56 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The handover has been made from the supervisory authority of the country where the complainant has lodged their complaint (Germany) in accordance with the Regulation’s provisions on cooperation in cross-border processing. The investigation in the case has been carried out through correspondence. In the light Postal address: of a complaint relating to cross-border processing, IMY has used the mechanisms for Box 8114 104 20 Stockholm cooperation and consistency contained in Chapter VII GDPR.

On behalf of the complainant, a product was ordered via Trionic’s German website. According to the complainant Trionic, for some reason became suspicious of the e- mail address used for the order and therefore sent a copy of the order confirmation to the info-e-mail address provided in the domain where the complainant has their e-mail address. Trionic also sent information about the order to a company even though it was not apparent from the privacy policy that data will be shared with that company. Furthermore, as of 1 July 2018, the privacy policy is not easily accessible. Clicking on the “Privacy Policy” link on Trionic’s website opens a new page on the website that links further to the policy located on another website. Trionic also reportedly Google searched the name, address and contact details of the complainant's representative and possibly linked that information to the complainant's data. Trionic has also stored the entire IPv6 number used when ordering. The privacy policy states that IP numbers are only processed for operation and maintenance purposes. Trionic has also continued to store the IP number even after the complainant canceled the order. What Trionic Sverige AB has stated Trionic has mainly stated the following. The company is the data controller for the processing to which the complaint relates. Transfer to info-e-mail address on the basis of a legal obligation Trionic sent a copy of the complainant’s order to an info-e-mail address on the basis of a legal obligation. Trionic is obliged to take all reasonable steps to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate in relation to the purposes for which they are processed are deleted or rectified without delay (cf. Art. 5(1)(d) GDPR). Trionic’s main target group is people in the age range 60-90 years. It is common for the company’s customers to make unintentional errors when ordering form in the company’s online store. When the company checked the details of the complainant’s order, it reacted to the fact that the e-mail address contained Trionic’s company name and the company therefore believed that the buyer had provided an invalid e-mail address. The company then attempted to contact the customer through the given telephone number in order to correct the e-mail address provided. The phone number turned out to be a fax number. In the absence of other contact details, the company visited the domain name of the email address. There the company found the info-e-mail address that the company, for valid reasons, thought was the correct e-mail address. The company then replaced the customer’s e-mail address with the one found and sent the order confirmation to that e-mail address. At the time, the company considered that it was its' only possibility to correct the customer’s contact details and that the measure therefore was necessary. When Trionic became aware of the mistake, the company found that it was unlikely that it had resulted in any risk to the complainant’s personal integrity. The reason for this was, in particular, that the circumstances indicated that the complainant’s personal data had been disclosed to a very limited circle of (other than the complainant) a family member and that it was personal data of relatively limited integrity value.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: DI-2021-3399 3(11) Date:2022-10-10 Legal basis for disclosure to combat fraud Trionic has disclosed personal data relating to the complainant to a provider of fraud control services on the basis of a legitimate interest which, at the time, acted as a data processor to the company. The information disclosed consisted of the complainant’s name, e-mail address, information that it is the complainant's first purchase from Trionic, the complainant’s e- mail domain name, telephone number, order number, number of items purchased, currency of the purchase, the value of the purchase, the complainant's invoice, delivery and IP address. On the German market, Trionic offers its customers to pay by invoice. It is Trionic that issues the invoice and accounts for the credit risk. Over the years, Trionic has been subject to a number of frauds and fraud attempts in the form of customers who choose to purchase products with invoice payment without the intention to actually pay the invoice. In order to prevent fraud (the purpose of the processing), Trionic has therefore used the services of the provider. The data in question have been disclosed to the service provider on the basis of Trionic’s legitimate interest to prevent fraud. Following a balancing test considering the complainant’s interests and fundamental rights and freedoms as set out below, Trionic considers that it has had a legal basis for the processing. The processing was necessary to achieve the purpose on the following grounds. The complainant chose to pay by invoice. The data provided by the customer differed from the norm, in that the fax number had been entered instead of a regular telephone number and the e-mail address contained the word “Trionic”. Trionic is responsible for the credit risk of invoice purchases on the German market and fraud attempts are 2 common for credit purchases in e-commerce. About two percent of all purchases in Trionic’s online store have been flagged as suspicious by the supplier. Furthermore, Trionic lacks the competence and resources to perform the type of analysis offered by the supplier. Against this background, there were no alternatives to the processing in order to achieve the objective of fraud prevention. As regards to what the data subject can reasonably expect, the company notes that the type of analysis offered by the supplier in the context of credit purchases is common in e-commerce on the European market. The aim is to prevent fraud. It constitutes a type of supplement to credit assessment. A credit assessment can show that a buyer is creditworthy, but not that the buyer is indeed the person to whom the credit assessment relates and that the buyer has a real intention to pay for the purchase. Therefore, in the case of online credit purchases, consumers must expect this type of assessment to be carried out. Regarding the nature of the data, Trionic argues that the supplier’s analysis was based entirely on the above-mentioned personal data that Trionic shared with the supplier. This data typically has a relatively limited integrity value, as in many cases it is publicly available. As regards the negative consequences, according to Trionic, the potentially negative consequence of the processing for the complainant is that the credit purchase would be refused, which is a relatively mild consequence that should not affect the outcome of the balancing of interests. 2See for example: https://www.svenskhandel.se/sakerhetscenter/amnesomraden/bedragerier/Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: DI-2021-3399 4(11) Date:2022-10-10 Legal basis for the processing and storage of IP address prior to cancellation The complainant’s IP address was stored and transferred to the supplier for the purpose of analysing the complainant’s geographical location at the time of ordering. These processing operations were carried out for the purposes of fraud prevention (Objective 1) and for the purpose of identifying and asserting legal interests (Objective 2). The purpose of fraud prevention is a legitimate interest of Trionic. With regard to the necessity of the processing, it can be noted that in the case of fraud attempts, the place of purchase and delivery often does not match the location of the IP address and the customer’s connection. Along with other warning signs, such as incorrect phone numbers and a possible IP address connected via anonymisation services, it helps Trionic avoid fraud. Often, fraudulent buyers have several different e-mail addresses but usually do not exchange IP address. Therefore, by saving and processing buyers’ IP addresses, Trionic can check the total amount of orders made in the web shop with the same IP address. Without saving the IP address, none of this would have been possible. With regard to what the data subject reasonably can expect, reference is made to the corresponding assessment regarding the disclosure of anti-fraud data as set out above. As for the purpose of establishing and exercising legal claims, Trionic has a legitimate interest in storing the IP address used in purchases in order to establish and enforce legal claims, both civil (debt collection) and criminal law (as a plaintiff in fraud investigations). As regards the necessity of processing, in the case of online credit purchases without the use of e-identification, there is no better opportunity to establish the actual identity of the buyer than to document the IP address used in the purchase. Proof of the identity of the buyer is directly necessary in order to recover past due claims and to obtain conviction in the event of fraud. Regarding what the data subject can reasonably expect, Trionic has made the assessment that from the point of view of the data subject it should appear more or less obvious that e-commerce companies save the IP address of the credit purchaser in connection with purchases in order to be able, if necessary, to establish the identity of the buyer and to recover past due claims and to be able to pursue criminal claims in the event of fraud. Furthermore, Trionic has considered that the IP address has a limited privacy value that does not outweigh Trionic’s need to establish and enforce legal claims and that the processing does not risk to cause any significant consequences for buyers. The most obvious consequence may be that the purchase will be denied. Legal basis for continued storage of IP address after cancellation Trionic continued to save the complainant’s IP address for the purchase after the order was cancelled. However, Trionic deleted it after receiving the complaint, which it interpreted as a request for deletion. Trionic considers that the company has a legitimate interest in saving the IP address used for the purchase in order to establish and enforce legal claims, both civil (receivable recovery) and criminal law (as plaintiff in fraud investigations). This also applies in the case of cancellations as it may have civil and criminal implications within the limitation period.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: DI-2021-3399 5(11) Date:2022-10-10 The processing is necessary in the same way as before cancellation. Concerning what the data subject could reasonably expect, it is the same as for storage prior to cancellation, with the addition that, in Trionic’s view, the assessment is not affected by the fact that it concerns a cancelled purchase, since it may have civil and criminal implications within the limitation period. However, as mentioned above, after receiving the complaint, Trionic decided to delete the complainant’s IP address. Easily accessible information to the data subject Trionic states that before confirming the purchase, the complainant had the opportunity to read Trionic’s Privacy Policy by clicking on a link in the text “\[I\] have read the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy and approves them.” It was then also possible for the complainant to access the Privacy Policy by clicking on a link on the company’s website. Due to a loading error, at the time of the complaint, two clicks were required to reach the privacy policy, which has since been corrected. The policy could also be accessed by just one click on a link to the policy at the bottom of the footer of the Trionic website. Information on the processing to combat fraud and the storage of IP addresses As regards information on anti-fraud, the processing activities section states: “Data processing is carried out using computers or IT-based systems in accordance with organisational procedures, which are specifically aimed at the stated purposes. In addition to the responsible person, other internal personnel (personnel management, sales, marketing, legal department, system administrators), or external resource — with the responsible person as principal (such as technical service providers, delivery companies, hosting providers, IT companies or communication agencies) — may operate this website and thus have access to the information. An up-to-date list of 3 these participants may be requested at any time from the provider (Trionic).” Trionic is aware of its obligation under Article 13 of the GDPR to inform about the recipients or categories of recipients who are to access the personal data. The text above states, inter alia, that Trionic may pass on personal data to external resources. With the complainant’s complaint, the company has reviewed the privacy policy and decided to amend it to explicitly indicate that personal data may be disclosed to companies that analyse the fraud risk of credit purchases. With regard to information about the storage of the IP address, the Privacy Policy specifies which data is processed by Trionic or by third parties. It states that so-called “user data” is stored when it is provided voluntarily by the user or collected automatically when using the online store and includes the user’s IP address. Furthermore, it is clear that collected personal data may be processed in order to safeguard Trionic’s rights and interests. Trionic informed about this in the same way as in the case of anti-fraud. 3Unofficial translation made by the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection.

Justification of the decision Applicable provisions, etc. Article 6(1) of the GDPR contains a list of possible legal bases for processing of personal data. One of the legal bases set out in this paragraph must be applicable in order for the processing to be lawful. The points applicable in the case are points 6(1)(c) and (f). According to Article 6(1)(c), processing is lawful if it is necessary for the performance of a legal obligation incumbent the controller. In order for processing to be based on Article 6(1)(f), all three conditions provided therein must be fulfilled, namely, firstly, that the controller or third party has a legitimate interest (legitimate interest), secondly that the processing is necessary for purposes of legitimate interest (necessary) and third that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not weigh heavier and require the protection of personal data (balance of interest). Recital 47 of the GDPR states that processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data 4 controller concerned. Furthermore, the Article 29 Working Party has previously stated that preventing abuse is a legitimate interest under the corresponding rules of the previously applicable Data Protection Directive, as long as the interest is ""acceptable 5 under the law"" in the broadest sense of the term. Article 13 sets out the information to be provided by the controller to the data subject where the personal data are collected from the data subject. Under Article 13(1)(e) the controller shall provide the data subject with information on the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data. According to Article 4(9), the term “recipient” means for an example a natural or legal person to whom the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. Assessment of the Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) Legal basis Transfer to the info e-mail address on the basis of a legal obligation Trionic stats that the sending of the complainant’s order confirmation to the info-e-mail address — which was a different e-mail address from the one that the complainant filled in — was made on the basis of a legal obligation. The obligation is to comply with the obligation under Article 5(1)(d) GDPR to take all reasonable steps to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate in relation to the purposes for which they are processed are deleted or rectified without delay. 4The Working Party was established under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC and was an independent EU advisory body on data protection and privacy issues. With the entry into force of the GDPR, he Working Party has been replaced by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) (see Articles 68 and 94(2) of the GDPR). 5Article 29 Working Party Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests of the data controller under Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC of 9 April 2014, WP 217, p. 25.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: DI-2021-3399 7(11) Date:2022-10-10 IMY notes that although Article 5(1)(d) constitutes a legal obligation for Trionic, it only permits the processing of personal data that is necessary. IMY observes that there were less coercive measures which the company could have taken that would have led to a lower risk of unauthorised disclosure of the complainant's data. For example, Trionic could have sent the order to the stated e-mail address and consider further measures, for example, if the company received an automatic e-mail server response that the message could not be delivered. The company could also have, for example, refrained from processing the order until the complainant contacted them again, send a regular letter to the address filled in by the complainant or send a fax to the fax number indicated. IMY therefore concludes that the processing was not necessary and that the company did not demonstrated that the processing could be based on this legal basis. Since it has not been established that Trionic had any other legal basis for the processing, the company has therefor processed the complainant’s personal data in breach of Article 6(1) and thus not met the requirement to have a legal basis for the processing. Legal basis for disclosure to combat fraud The investigation shows that Trionic has disclosed the complainant's personal data to a provider offering anti-fraud services. Trionic argues that the processing had a legal basis in the company’s legitimate interest in preventing fraud, i.e. Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. IMY notes that it is therefore necessary for the company to be able to demonstrate that three conditions are met: • there are one or more legitimate interests • the processing of personal data is necessary for a purpose relating to the legitimate interests • the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects do not outweigh the company’s legitimate interests (balance of interests). IMY notes that what may be a legitimate interest should be interpreted broadly. The decisive factor is whether the interest is permitted by law or otherwise generally recognised in the rule of law. Insignificant interests do not weigh as heavily as important or compelling interests, but are important only in the balancing of interests. However, if an interest is not justified and legitimate, the balancing of interests shall not be carried out, as the initial threshold of this legal basis will not be reached. It must also be an actual interest at the time of the processing and not an interest which is hypothetical at that time. If there are evidence that the interest is not hypothetical, the condition is satisfied, but it may also be sufficient that the interest typically appears to be factual. IMY finds that the interest presented by Trionic — to prevent fraud — was justified (cf. recital 47 of the GDPR) and actual at the time of processing. IMY notes that the requirement of necessity means that the interests which the processing is intended to protect could not reasonably be protected in an equally effective manner by other means less intrusive on the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects. The condition must be examined together with the principlePrivacy Protection Authority Our ref: DI-2021-3399 8(11) Date:2022-10-10 of data minimisation which means, among other things, that personal data should not be processed unnecessarily. According to IMY, the processing — the disclosure of the data to the anti-fraud service provider — was necessary in order to fulfil the purpose which Trionic could not reasonably fulfil in an equally effective manner by, for example, carrying out such an assessment itself. This assessment also considers the fact that the disclosure was not too extensive or privacy sensitive in itself. IMY notes that the third condition under Article 6(1)(f), balancing of interests, is carried out by making an overall assessment, considering in particular: • the seriousness of the violation that the processing entails for the data subject • what data subjects reasonably can expect in that situation and • what security measures have been taken. When balancing the company's legitimate interests on one hand against the complainant's interests, rights and freedoms on the other, IMY finds that the company's interests weighs heavily especially considering it is a credit purchase. This must be weighed against the complainant’s interest in not having their data processed or not risking being denied the purchase of the credit. The processing appears, in IMY’s view, to be something that the complainant could reasonably expect when making a credit purchase on invoice, despite the minor deficiencies in the information identified below by IMY in relation to the information provided on that category of recipients of the data. With regard to the seriousness of the violation, IMY finds that the processing does not appear to be highly violating of privacy and that the data itself is not privacy sensitive. When it comes to protective measures, there has been no evidence of relevance for the assessment in this case. In an overall assessment IMY finds that the company has shown that the complainant’s interests or fundamental rights and freedoms do not outweigh the company's legitimate interests for the processing. In conclusion, the company has demonstrated that the conditions laid down in Article 6(1)(f) are met and the company therefore had a legal basis for the processing. Legal basis for the processing and storage of IP address prior to cancellation Trionic states that it processed and stored the complainant’s IP address prior to cancellation on the basis of the legitimate interests of (1) preventing fraud and (2) being able to establish and enforce legal interests. IMY has already considered that the disclosure of, inter alia, the complainant’s IP number in order to prevent fraud had a legal basis. There has been no reason to make any other assessment regarding Trionic’s own continued processing and storage of that information before the complainant cancelled their order. Furthermore, IMY considers that there were no grounds for calling into question the legality of Trionic’s processing before the cancellation was made in order for Trionic to be able to establish and enforce legal claims. The processing of the complainant's IP number therefore had a legal basis.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: DI-2021-3399 9(11) Date:2022-10-10 Legal basis for processing and storing IP address after cancellation Trionic states that the complainant’s IP address was also saved for a certain period after the order was cancelled, on the basis of its legitimate interest of being able to establish and enforce legal claims. However, the data was deleted after the complainant's request. In view of the fact that Trionic deleted the data in response to the complainant’s request and thereby satisfied the complainant’s rights, IMY considers that the subject matter of the complaint has been examined to the extent appropriate. IMY does not therefore investigate whether Trionics had a legal basis for storing the complainant’s IP number after the cancellation or whether the company’s general storage periods are well balanced. Easily accessible information to the data subject It is apparent from the company’s own information that, at the time of the complaint, two clicks were required for the complainant (considering the links the complainant chose to fallow) to be able to access Trionic’s privacy policy on its website. The investigation also shows that the information was accessible on the website with fewer clicks (one) in two other ways. Against this background, and the fact that Trionic also has taken steps to ensure that the policy requires only one click, IMY considers that the subject matter of the complaint in this part has been investigated to the extent appropriate. Information to the data subject on the processing for the purposes of combating fraud and storage of IP address The investigation shows that Trionic has disclosed the complainant’s data to a supplier for the purpose of combating fraud. In order to comply with the obligation to provide information to the complainant, Trionic had indicated in its privacy policy at the time that personal data could be passed on to ‘external resources’. Trionic has now changed this information so that it is explicitly stated that personal data may be disclosed to companies that analyse the fraud risk of credit purchases. IMY considers that the information provided to the complainant — “external resources” — was not sufficiently specific to meet the requirement of Article 13(1)(e) GDPR to inform the data subject about the recipient (the actual provider) or the categories of recipients (anti-fraud service providers) who would receive the personal data in the case. Trionic therefore infringed Article 13(1)(e). Searching for the complainant’s data on search engines The complainant has stated that Trionic has searched contact details on a search engine and gathered them together with the complainant’s data. The statement was rejected as by Trionic. IMY considers that there has been no reason to question the company’s statement. The investigation in the case does not therefore show that Trionic has processed the complainant’s personal data in breach of the General Data Protection Regulation in this part. Choice of corrective measure It follows from Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83(2) of the GDPR that the IMY has the power to impose administrative fines in accordance with Article 83. Depending on thePrivacy Protection Authority Our ref: DI-2021-3399 10(11) Date:2022-10-10 circumstances of the case, administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or in place of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2), such as injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83(2) provides which factors are to be taken into account when deciding on administrative fines and in determining the amount of the fine. In the case of a minor infringement, as stated in recital 148, IMY may, instead of imposing a fine, issue a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b). Factors to consider are the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement and past relevant infringements. IMY notes the following relevant facts. The violations have affected one person, the personal data in question was not privacy-sensitive and the company has not previously been found to have infringed the GDPR. Furthermore, Trionic Sverige AB has improved its information to data subjects and acted in response to the complaint. Against this background IMY considers that it is a minor infringement within the meaning of recital 148 and that Trionic Sverige AB must be given a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR.

The Privacy Protection Authority decides with the support of articles 58.2 and 83 i data protection regulation that Indecap AB must pay an administrative penalty fee of SEK 500,000 for the violation of Article 32.1 of the data protection regulation. Account of the supervisory matter The Swedish Privacy Agency (IMY) has received complaints that Indecap AB (Indecap) on 20 January 2021 incorrectly sent an email containing a file with personal information about, among other things, customers' finances to others customers. IMY has initiated supervision of Indecap with the aim of investigating what appears from the complaints. Indecap has stated that it considers itself responsible for the personal data of the person in question the processing of personal data. In addition, the company has stated in summary following. All information in Indecap's system was protected and required user login to access the information that was included in the erroneous mailing. That which occurred in the current case was that an employee retrieved information from the system containing personal data to process the information into a report i Excel. During processing, the Excel file was saved and unluckily renamed to one Mailing address: similar name to the general PDF report on the development of the funds that would Box 8114 is sent out to customers. When the employee would later attach the PDF report in the mailing 104 20 Stockholm, the employee happened to attach the Excel file which was being processed and which contained Website: personal data, instead of the correct PDF report. Because of the human www.imy.se E-mail: imy@imy.se 1 European Parliament and Council Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with Telephone: regarding the processing of personal data and on the free flow of such data and on the cancellation of 08-657 61 00 directive 95/46/EC (general data protection regulation). Data Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-3422 2(11) Date: 2023-11-07 the mistake, the incorrect file was thus sent out to a number of customers before the error was noticed and the shipment was stopped. The erroneously attached file that was sent by e-mail to the company's customers contained information about customers' names, social security number, bank, name of bank adviser, email address, selected risk level, allocation to funds (limited to individual fund selection) and that last read the value of the customers' holdings in these funds. The file did not contain any information about account numbers, login details, shareholdings in specific funds, or information about fund portfolios regarding capital insurance, service or private pensions. The incorrect mailings comprised 52,364 were registered personal data, and was received by a maximum of 2,813 people. The exact number of recipients cannot be determined as Indecap's own investigations show that the email has been stuck in the mail filter of many of the customers. Indecap has an information security policy and applies documented processes and routines linked to personal data and information security management. Before the incident occurred, Indecap had limited access to the relevant systems which concerns customer data, so that only four employees had access to these. Indecap had further trained all staff in personal data and information security management. The internal investigation carried out by Indecap after the current incident has shown that difficulties in complying with Indecap's duality routine which is applied in larger handling of personal data. The routine means that two individuals must approve/verify a certain one action before it can be implemented. The reason for the difficulties in complying with this routine is explained by the increased distance work required due to Covid-19 the pandemic. The part that was not carried out in the incident was to visually, with a so-called four-eyes principle, ensure that the correct data is entered into the system and attached correct before the data was sent out via e-mail. This could not be done remotely and made it possible to attach the incorrect file. The file that was incorrectly included in the for this reason, the email was not encrypted or contained any reading restrictions. However, access to the original computer was limited based on authorization as well as password protected. Before the incident occurred, Indecap had launched a system-based application with login via BankID in order to reduce the risks that arise when data is sent via E-mail. Before the incident, Indecap had made a decision to phase out its routine for sending emails. Since the incident occurred, quarterly reports are no longer sent out by email. Nowadays, customers are instead directed to log in with BankID at Indecap to see their portfolio development. Furthermore, reports containing customer data are now available encrypted and password protected. In addition to immediately stopping all planned customer communication through letters/emails Indecap took a number of measures in connection with the incident occurring. The company initiated a major incident investigation together with external experts to map and document the incident, as well as to carry out an inspection of Indecaps systematic data protection work. The internal investigation, which has been completed, includes a analysis of the seriousness of the personal data incident according to ENISA's method for assessment of personal data incidents and plan for measures. In addition, Indecap has among other things, updated routines around homework and the duality process, sent information to data subjects about the incident, took additional technical measures security measures and held extra training sessions for employees. The Swedish Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-3422 3(11) Date: 2023-11-07 Indecap has submitted a personal data incident report to IMY and made a incident report to the Financial Supervisory Authority due to the incident being investigated in the case. In the notification to IMY, Indecap stated, among other things, that the company had contacted them recipient who received the e-mail with personal data and asked them to delete it the message and confirm that the message had been deleted. Justification of the decision Applicable regulations According to Article 4.7 of the Data Protection Regulation, the person in charge of personal data is a physical or legal person, public authority, institution or other body which alone or together with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. If the purposes and means of the processing are determined by Union law or the national law of the Member States can the personal data controller or the special criteria for how he is to be appointed are prescribed in Union law or in national law of the Member States. The personal data controller is responsible for and must be able to demonstrate that the basic principles in Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation are followed. This is apparent from Article 5.2 of the data protection regulation. According to Article 5.1 f of the data protection regulation, personal data must be processed in one way which ensures appropriate security for the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unauthorized processing and against loss, destruction or damage by accident, using appropriate technical or organizational measures. It follows from Article 32.1 of the Data Protection Regulation that the person in charge of personal data shall take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a safety level that is appropriate in relation to the risk of the treatment. At the assessment of which technical and organizational measures are appropriate must data controllers take into account the latest developments, implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment as well as the risks for rights and freedoms of natural persons. According to Article 32(1), appropriate safeguards include, where appropriate, a) pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data, b) the ability to continuously ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of treatment systems and services; c) the ability to restore availability and access to personal data in a reasonable time in the event of a physical or technical incident, and d) a procedure for regularly testing, investigating and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures that must ensure the security of the processing. According to article 32.2 of the data protection regulation, when assessing the appropriate security level special consideration is given to the risks that the treatment entails, in particular for accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or for unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise treated. According to Article 87 of the Data Protection Regulation, the member states may decide in more detail which special conditions a national identification number or something else accepted methods of identification may be processed. A national identification number or another In such cases, the accepted method of identification must only be used in compliance with the Swedish Data Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-3422 4(11) Date: 2023-11-07 appropriate protective measures for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects according to this regulation. According to ch. 3 Section 10 of the law (2018:218) with supplementary regulations to the EU's data protection regulation, social security numbers and coordination numbers may be processed without consent only when it is clearly justified with regard to the purpose of the processing, the importance of a secure identification or any other considerable reason. The Swedish Privacy Protection Authority's assessment Through the investigation into the matter, it has emerged that Indecap has mistakenly sent an unencrypted file containing personal data on approx. 52,000 customers with e-mails to approx 2,800 recipients who were not authorized to receive the current information. The the file in question contained, among other things, information about customers' names, email addresses, social security number, bank, risk level, individual fund selection and the last loaded value of the customer's holdings in these funds. Indecap is responsible for personal data Indecap has stated that the company is responsible for personal data for it personal data processing that is reviewed in the case. The investigation shows that the purpose of sending the message in question was to inform customers about the general development of funds. IMY notes that Indecap has determined purpose and means of the processing of the personal data, i.e. how and why the personal data is to be processed. It is thus Indecap as per article 4.7 of the data protection regulation has been responsible for personal data for the person in question the processing of personal data. The treatment involved a high risk According to Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation, Indecap has an obligation to protect them personal data that the company processes by taking appropriate technical and organizational measures. The measures must ensure an appropriate level of security. At the assessment of which level of security is appropriate shall be the responsibility of the personal data controller take into account the costs, the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing and the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons that the processing entails. From ch. 1 Section 11 first paragraph of the Act (2007:528) on the securities market follows that anyone who is or has been connected to a securities company may not disclose information without authorization or make use of what he or she has learned about in the employment or during the assignment someone else's business or personal relationships. Because Indecap is one securities company applies these legal requirements on confidentiality in the company's operations. The places high demands on the protection of the personal data processed in the business. In this case, the data that has been handled has, among other things, consisted of special protection officers personal data, namely social security numbers, which may only be processed under certain conditions conditions. There has also been a question of financial information, such as the latest one the holdings in funds and the most recently read value of the customers' holdings in these funds, for which data subjects have legitimate expectations of a high degree of confidentiality and robust protection against unauthorized access. IMY notes that the context for the processing of personal data has resulted in an even higher demand for the protection level. Personal data processing has taken place within the framework of Indecaps core business for which the company should have had good ability to secure a security that was appropriate based on the scope and sensitivity of the processing. The Swedish Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-3422 5(11) Date: 2023-11-07 Compiling a large amount of privacy-sensitive personal data entails in addition, special risks as loss of control over such a compilation may result to the detriment of many registered users. In the current case, the processing concerned data about a large number of registered users (approx. 52,000 people). With regard, among other things, to the fact that the data processed by Indecap has been deleted Indecaps have protective nature and affected a very large number of people processing of the personal data in total entailed a high risk of physical rights and freedoms of persons. The nature, scope and context of the treatment have thereby entailing a requirement for strong data protection. The measures would include otherwise ensure that the personal data was protected against unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access. Indecap has not taken sufficient measures to protect the data From the complaints and Indecap's account it appears that the file with personal data has attached to an e-mail message sent out to a large number of people. Uncaps The sending of the file in question has meant that people who do not have the right to take part the data has been accessed. Indecap has stated that the file was attached to the email as a result of a mistake by an individual employee. Indecap, as the personal data controller, is responsible for all personal data processing that takes place under the company's management or on behalf of the company. IN in this case, the incorrect attachment of the file has occurred within the scope of the employee service. Indecap is responsible for the processing of personal data carried out by it employee took place in accordance with the data protection regulation's requirements for a suitable security level. IMY also assesses that the mistake in question could have been prevented or at least becomes more difficult. In its operations, Indecap treats both the public and security guards information. Depending on, among other things, the sensitivity of the information, different requirements are placed on appropriate level of protection and thus the content of the routines for handling this data. In the handling of public information, there is, for example, no reason to consider the risk of unauthorized access when choosing appropriate communication channels. To not jeopardize the protection of information of a nature worthy of protection, Indecap should have been clear procedures to ensure that the handling of information worthy of protection would not mixed with the handling of public information. From Indecap's own data appears that one reason an incorrect file was attached was that it had been renamed to one similar name to another file that contained general information about funds development. This suggests that Indecap did not have clear enough instructions to prevent documents containing customer data from being mixed up with others public documents. Nor has it emerged that Indecap implemented any technical or organizational barriers or control functions that have made the incorrect the handling of the file, e.g. technical obstacles or warnings in connection with the file attached in e-mail. Admittedly, Indecap has had a routine which means that every dispatch must checked by fellow staff in order to prevent the type of mistake in question. It has however, it emerged that the current routine was not used as a result of difficulties to maintaining the routine for home work during the then prevailing Covid-19 pandemic. IMY however, believes that Indecap in the situation that has arisen, especially with regard to the sensitivity of the data the company processes in its core business, should have taken other measures for to ensure a sufficient level of protection for the relevant data when the current one the protective measure could not be taken as a result of the pandemic. The pandemic has thus not The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2021-3422 6(11) Date: 2023-11-07 constituted a reasonable excuse for deviating from existing security procedures without replace these with some other equivalent protection. IMY states that the lack of measures to prevent the privacy sensitive the information about the customers was sent out has meant that the risk that employees would make incorrect mailings been high. IMY further notes that the file in question lacked protection in the form of, for example read restrictions or encryption. After the file was mistakenly attached in the email unauthorized persons have therefore been able to gain access to privacy-sensitive information about over 50,000 identifiable individuals in plain text. There has also been a risk that the data would be spread further, for example by one of the unauthorized recipients forwarded the email. According to IMY, there have been shortcomings regarding the protection of personal data partly through that Indecap has not taken sufficient technical or organizational measures to prevent employees from incorrectly sending out customer data by e-mail to unauthorized persons recipient, partly because the data was not protected against unauthorized access, e.g. through encryption. Indecap's protective measures would ensure that personal data about the company's customers was protected against unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access. Indecap has, however, through e- the January 20, 2021 mail that was sent to a large number of unauthorized persons recipients disclosed unencrypted personal data about their customers, including information about customers' finances. IMY concludes in summary that Indecap has not taken sufficient technical measures and organizational measures to ensure a level of security that has been appropriate in relation to the risk. Indecap has thus processed personal data in violation of article 32.1 of the data protection regulation. Choice of intervention Legal regulation In the event of violations of the data protection regulation, IMY has a number of corrective measures powers, including reprimands, injunctions and penalty charges. It follows from article 58.2 a–j of the data protection regulation. IMY shall impose penalty fees in addition to or instead of other corrective measures referred to in Article 58(2), depending the circumstances of each individual case. Each supervisory authority must ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty charges in each individual case are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The stated in Article 83.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. Article 83.2 specifies the factors that must taken into account in determining whether an administrative penalty fee should be imposed and, if so, with what amount. According to Article 83.4, in the event of violations of, among other things, Article 32, it must be imposed administrative penalty fees of up to EUR 10,000,000 or, if one applies company, of up to 2% of the total global annual turnover in the previous year budget year, depending on which value is the highest. The Swedish Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-3422 7(11) Date: 2023-11-07 The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has adopted guidelines on the calculation of administrative penalty charges according to the data protection regulation which aims to create 2 a harmonized method and principles for calculating penalty fees. If it is a question of a minor violation, IMY receives according to what is stated in reason 148 i instead of imposing a penalty charge, issue a reprimand in accordance with Article 58.2 b i the regulation. IMY's assessment A penalty fee must be imposed IMY has made the assessment that Indecap has processed personal data in violation of article 32.1 of the data protection regulation. The violation has occurred through Indecap processing personal data with a insufficient level of security, which has led to, among other things, financial information about over 50,000 registrants sent via email to around 2,800 unauthorized recipients. Indecap has been aware of the risks of emailing and had therefore introduced special control routines, but due to the pandemic, made deviations from the control routine without taking compensatory protective measures. The incorrect dispatch has resulted in a high risk for the freedoms and rights of the registered, including loss of confidentiality of data worthy of protection. Against this background, IMY assesses that it was not a question of a minor violation. Indecap must therefore be charged an administrative sanction fee for the violation. At determining the size of the penalty fee, IMY must take into account the circumstances that stated in Article 83.2 as well as ensuring that the administrative sanction fee is effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The parent company's annual turnover must be used as the basis for the calculation When determining the maximum amount for the penalty fee, the definition of the concept of company is used as follows from the practice of the European Court of Justice according to Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU (see recital 150 of the Data Protection Regulation). Of the court's practice it appears that the concept of company includes every entity that carries out economic activities, regardless of the entity's legal form and the method of its financing, as well as whether the entity in the legal sense consists of several natural or legal persons. What constitutes a company must therefore be based on the definitions of competition law. The rules for group liability in EU competition law revolve around the concept economic unit. A parent company and a subsidiary company are considered part of the same economic unit when the parent company exercises decisive influence over the subsidiary. The decisive influence (ie control) can be achieved either through ownership or by agreement. It appears from the practice of the European Court of Justice that one hundred percent or almost one hundred percent ownership involves a presumption for control to be considered exist. However, the presumption can be rebutted if the company provides sufficient evidence 3 to prove that the subsidiary acts independently on the market. To refute the presumption, the company must therefore provide evidence relating to the organizational, the financial and legal links between the subsidiary and its parent company which shows that they do not constitute an economic unit even though the parent company owns 100 percent or almost 100 percent of the shares. 4 2EDPB's guidelines Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR, adopted on 24 May 2023. 3Case C-97/08, para. 59-61 4 Cf. EDPB's guidelines Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR, point 125 and where reported rulings. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2021-3422 8(11) Date: 2023-11-07 The group in which Indecap is a part consists of three companies, the parent company Indecap Holding AB and the two sister companies Indecap and Indecap Fonder AB. Indecap Holding AB's commission income consists of Indecap's and Indecap Fonder AB's commission income. Indecap has stated that the turnover attributable to Indecap Fonder AB should excluded when calculating a penalty fee. In support of this, Indecap has stated that the current violation only occurred in one of the group companies, namely Indecap. Indecap is a securities company that provides individual pension savings and advice on the fund market. Indecap Fonder AB is in turn a fund company that manages nine funds within different equity and fixed income strategies. Indecap Fonder AB has few direct customers but distributes the funds via various platforms and banks. Indecap Fonder AB's funds are indeed selectable at Indecap, but Indecaps fund portfolios also consist of many other funds that have no connection to the commodity itself Indecap Fonder AB or Indecap Holding AB. The customer data included in the mailing belonged only to customers of Indecap. Indecap Holding AB owns 100 percent of the shares in Indecap and it therefore exists a presumption that Indecap and Indecap Holding AB are an economic entity. Indecap has not highlighted anything that shows that Indecap is acting independently in relation to the parent company which causes the presumption to be broken. That subsidiaries in the group have businesses with different orientations, or that an incident only occurred in one subsidiaries, are not such circumstances that in themselves have any effect on the presumption of the parent company's influence. IMY assesses with regard to the above that the company's turnover that will be added to the basis for calculating the administrative penalty fee that Indecap can imposed is Indecap's parent company Indecap Holding AB (556971-6987). In the EDPB's guidelines, the starting point is that the annual turnover refers to the company's net sales, i.e. the amount obtained through the sale of goods and provision of services after deduction of sales discounts and value added tax as well as other taxes that are directly related to turnover. To determine which turnover Indecap Holding AB had during the previous financial year has IMY obtained information from the group's annual report for 2022. This information shows that Indecap Holding AB has had commission income amounting to SEK 558,260,000. Indecap has stated that Indecap Holding AB's annual report is prepared in accordance with the law (1995:1559) on annual reports in credit institutions and securities companies and that the post for commission income does not fairly reflect the group's net sales. The current commission income is stated before the Pensions Authority's agreed mandatory discount on management fees has been deducted. The agreement with The pension authority's discount is a requirement for a fund company to be able to offer funds on the premium pension's fund market. Discounts to the Pensions Authority amounted to year 2022 to SEK 394,326,770. Indecap Holding AB's net turnover is thus the sum 5EDPB's guidelines Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR, point 128-130. 6 The definition corresponds to that stated in Article 5.2 of Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on annual accounts, consolidated accounts and reports in certain types of companies, on amendment of European Parliament and Council Directive 2006/43/EC and repealing Council Directive 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC Text of importance for the EEA and which has been implemented in Swedish law through ch. 1, § 3, third point Annual Accounts Act (1995:1554) Data Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-3422 9(11) Date: 2023-11-07 which remains after this discount has been deducted. Indecap has submitted documents to verification of the discounts submitted to the Pensions Authority. IMY makes the following assessment. Indecap Holding AB's annual report contains none clear accounting item that can be equated with the company's net sales. For that one sanction fee shall have the corresponding effect regardless of the accounting rules that it the intervention is aimed at applies, according to IMY, however, it is important that the turnover is calculated in such a way that it corresponds to what would have constituted net turnover if the accounting rules of the Annual Accounts Act had been applied. There is a lack of guidance clarifications from the EU Court of Justice or the EDPB that clarify how the annual turnover i credit institutions and securities companies must be calculated. IMY therefore assesses, against background of that net turnover must be determined with deduction of discounts provided, that relevant annual turnover for Indecap Holding AB must be assessed with deductions for discounts on management fees. Indecap has proven through submitted documents that the discounts to The pension authority in the year 2022 amounted to the amount they indicated. IMY assesses with regard to the above that the relevant annual turnover for Indecap Holding AB is approximately SEK 140,199,260. Two percent of that annual turnover is approx SEK 2,800,000. The maximum penalty amount that can be determined in the case is therefore 10,000,000 EUR. The seriousness of the violation IMY assesses that the following factors are important for the assessment of the infringement seriousness. IMY has established that Indecap did not take sufficient technical and organizational measures measures to reduce the risk that personal data about the company's customers would be disseminated to unauthorized persons. The current security flaws have led to an incident that has affected one large number of registered and a large number of unauthorized recipients have been able to take part others' personal data in plain text. The information has included financial information and information about social security numbers, i.e. information that requires strong protection. The management of the personal data was also part of Indecap's core business where the data covered by statutory confidentiality. Indecap has also been aware of the risks of emailing and had therefore introduced special control routines, but on grounds of the pandemic, deviated from the control routine without taking compensatory measures protective measures. When assessing the seriousness of the violation, IMY takes into account, in mitigation, that Indecap already started work on replacement before the current incident mailing to a more secure alternative. This process was also accelerated after it current incident. It appears from the EDPB's guidelines that the supervisory authority must assess whether the violation is of low, medium or high severity. IMY assesses against the background of above circumstances that in total it is a violation of Article 32.1 of the Data Protection Regulation of medium severity. As a mitigating circumstance, it is taken into account that Indecap, before IMY started supervision, immediately and in a clear manner informed the data subjects concerned about what occurred. IMY also considers that Indecap contacted the recipients of the erroneously sent e- 7 EDPB's guidelines Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR, point 60.

The penalty fee must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive The administrative penalty fee must be effective, proportionate and deterrent. This means that the amount must be determined so that the administrative the penalty fee leads to correction, that it provides a preventive effect and that it in addition, is proportionate in relation to current violations as well as to the supervised entity's ability to pay. IMY assesses that a penalty fee calculated on the parent company's total net turnover would not, in the present case, lead to the imposition of the penalty fee far too high in relation to the violation established in the case. It exists therefore not reason to reduce the penalty fee on the basis that the violation only intended for a company in the group. In light of the seriousness of the violation, aggravating and mitigating circumstances IMY determines the administrative sanction fee for Indecap at SEK 500,000 for the established violation. IMY considers this amount to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. This decision has been taken by the head of unit Catharina Fernquist after a presentation by the lawyer Evelin Palmér.

Hence, If Skadeförsäkring AB has not implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing. IMY gives If Skadeförsäkring a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR for the concluded violation. Presentation on the supervisory case IMY has initiated supervision regarding If Skadeförsäkring AB (“If” or “the company”) due to a complaint. The complainant has stated that personal data regarding health has been sent via e- mail without encryption all the way from the sender to the receiver, i.e. by the use of so-called end-to-end encryption. Due to the complaint, IMY has initiated an investigation for the purpose of assessing whether If has ensured an appropriate level of security in accordance with Article 32 of the GDPR as regards the relevant processing. The investigation in this case has been carried out through written correspondence. Since the complaint concerns cross-border processing, IMY has used the mechanisms for cooperation and consistency contained in Chapter VII of the GDPR. The supervisory authorities concerned have been the data protection authorities in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Estonia. 1Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: DI-2021-4355 2(6) Date:2023-01-19 What If have stated If has mainly stated the following. Transfer of sensitive personal data via e-mail as per 6 November 2020 If has stated that the company is the data controller for the processing of personal data to which the complaint relates. Furthermore, If has stated that, in the context of its claims settlement, the company sent an e-mail to the complainant in one of the complainant’s reported personal injury. The e-mail was sent on 6 November 2020 to the e-mail address provided by the complainant. It contained If’s decision and an attached file containing the medical assessment which the decision was based upon. The medical assessment included information regarding background, course of events, diagnosis, assessment, graduation of possible invalidity and date of birth (not the social security number). The e-mail was sent encrypted with so-called Enforced Transport Layer Encryption (Enforced TLS-encryption). This implied that the message was encrypted from If’s servers to the recipient’s e-mail server, which in the present case was hosted by Tele2 (the operator). In the event that a receiving server was unable to receive a TLS encrypted message, the message was not sent. Thus, it was ensured that the message was always encrypted during transmission. The company’s guidelines in force at the time stated that when sensitive personal data were sent by e-mail, the e- mail should always be encrypted. 2 The solution with enforced TLS encryption was implemented following a decision from the Danish data protection authority, Datatilsynet, where If received criticism for using opportunistic TLS encryption for e-mails containing sensitive personal data. If also refers to a decision of Datatilsynet in which the Danish data protection authority concluded, following an investigation of a law firm, that the use of enforced TLS 1.2 entails an encryption with sufficient security for e-mails containing confidential and sensitive personal information during transmission. If stated that it was this encryption solution that was used when the e-mail containing the medical assessment was sent to the complainant on 6 November 2020. New solution for managing e-mail messages If has stated that, during the period following the complaint, the company has increased its security by, among other things, developing and launching a new communication solution for e-mails that are sent to the company’s customers. Within the framework of this solution, If’s customers get access to e-mails via “My Pages” on the company’s website. The solution works in such a way that a notification is sent to the customer by e-mail or text message informing the customer that the customer has received a message from If that can be read on “My pages”. In order to log in to “My pages”, the customer needs to authenticate with the Swedish e-identification “BankID”. 2 See Datatilsynet’s (Denmark) decision of 18 June 2020 in case J.nr. 2019-31-2175. 3 See Datatilsynet’s (Denmark) decision of 5 November 2019 in case J.nr. 2019-41-0026.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: DI-2021-4355 3(6) Date:2023-01-19 Justification of the decision Applicable provisions Data concerning health constitutes so-called sensitive personal data. It is prohibited to process such special categories of personal data pursuant to Article 9(1) of the GDPR, unless any of the exceptions set out under Article 9(2) is applicable to the processing. These data are considered to be worthy of extra protection as the processing of such data may pose significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedom of individuals. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 32(1) of the GDPR, the controller shall take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security for the protection of the data being processed. When assessing the appropriate technical and organisational measures, the controller shall take into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing and the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. According to Article 32(1), appropriate safeguards include, among other things: • The pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data. • The ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services. • The ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident. • A process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing. Pursuant to Article 32(2) of the GDPR, when assessing the appropriate level of security, account shall be taken in particular of the risks that are presented by the processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. IMY’s assessment E-mail sent to the complainant on 6 November 2020 Since the controller is responsible for the security of the processing pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR, the controller needs to assess the risks associated with the processing of personal data and take appropriate technical and organisational measures to address the identified risks. What constitute appropriate measures should not be understood as an arbitrary estimation, but an adequate assessment, based on the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing and the risks to the individual’s rights and freedoms. In this case, the issue is the transfer of sensitive personal data over an open network (internet). The processing of sensitive personal data entails that the technical and organisational measures to be taken by the controller are subject to enhanced requirements. When an e-mail is sent over an open network, the sender or recipient generally has no control over which computers (e.g. servers) the specific e-mail passes along the way. A consequence of this is that anyone who possesses equipment that unprotected e- mails pass through, can access, disseminate or distort them.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: DI-2021-4355 4(6) Date:2023-01-19 By taking appropriate technical and organisational measures, it should not be possible for unauthorised persons to read personal data transmitted over an open network. This can be achieved by encrypting the e-mail containing personal data and/or by protecting the transmission of the e-mail through encryption. Enforced TLS is an example of an encryption solution that can be used to protect an e-mail. In the present case, enforced TLS was used when the relevant e-mail was sent. IMY notes that the solution used by If to send the e-mail to the complainant only encrypted the e-mail during the transport from If’s e-mail server to the e-mail server provided by the complainant’s operator. This implied that the encryption ended before the message had reached the final recipient and, thus, did not constitute an end-to-end encryption. Consequently, there was a risk that unauthorised persons could access the e-mail in plain text after the encrypted transmission had ended. In light of the above, it cannot be deemed that If had protected the data in such a manner that only the intended recipient could access it after the e-mail had been delivered to the operator’s e-mail server. At that moment, the encryption ceased and therefore the data lacked sufficient protection against unauthorised disclosure of, or unauthorised access to, the personal data. Since the e-mail contained sensitive personal data, there was a significant risk of breach of the complainant’s privacy. If refers to a decision issued by the Danish data protection authority, Datatilsynet, which concerns a law firm, to demonstrate that Datatilsynet has deemed enforced TLS to be a sufficiently secure solution for transfer of sensitive personal data. IMY notes that the relevant decision does not concern a specific processing, but rather a planned investigation of the security of the processing of personal data, in particular when using encrypted e-mails. The law firm has specified various methods that it uses to ensure secure communication. The method to be applied is assessed in each individual case and one of the methods is to encrypt the transmission of e-mails using enforced TLS. Datatilsynet has assessed that the law firm’s action was in accordance with the GDPR. IMY’s investigation in this particular case differs from the Danish decision since this investigation concerns the question whether a specific consignment has been adequately protected all the way from the sender to the receiver. In conclusion, IMY considers that, during the specific occasion, If had not taken appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk posed by the processing, since If had sent the e-mail containing sensitive personal data without ensuring that the deployed encryption solution protected the message all the way to the recipient. Consequently, If processed personal data in breach of Article 32(1) of the GDPR. If’s new solution for managing e-mails If has stated that, during the period following the complaint, the company has, among other things, developed and launched a new communication solution for e-mails to its customers. It is noted that the personal data processing carried out within the scope of this new solution is not subject of the complaint and is therefore not part of IMY’s investigation.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: DI-2021-4355 5(6) Date:2023-01-19 Choice of intervention Article 58(2) and Article 83(2) of the GDPR give IMY the authority to impose an administrative fine. Depending on the circumstances of the case, an administrative fine shall be imposed in addition to or in place of the other measures referred to under Article 58(2), such as injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83(2) determines the factors to be taken into account when deciding on an administrative fine and determining the amount of the fine. In the case of a minor infringement, as stated in recital 148, IMY may, instead of imposing a fine, issue a reprimand under Article 58(2)(b). The aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement and previous infringements of relevance, shall be considered. IMY has found that If has processed personal data in breach of Article 32(1) of the GDPR. An infringement of that provision may give rise to a fine. If’s infringement was committed when the company sent an e-mail containing sensitive personal data to the complainant on 6 November 2020 without using a sufficiently secure encryption solution that protected the message all the way from the sender to the intended recipient (so-called end-to-end encryption). IMY’s investigation concerns an e-mail sent by If without the use of adequate security measures — the one to which the complaint relates. If has worked to improve the security by, following Datatilsynet’s decision against If, changing from opportunistic to enforced TLS and also, following the complainant’s allegations of security flaws, taking security measures by, among other things, developing and launching a new communication solution for e-mails to the company’s customers. Overall, IMY therefore considers the infringement to be minor why, on the basis of 58(2)(b) of the GDPR, If is given a reprimand. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This decision has been approved by unit manager , following a presentation by It and information security specialist .Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: DI-2021-4355 6(6) Date:2023-01-19 How to appeal If you wish to appeal the decision, you should write to the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection.

Supervision under the General Data 134632 Protection Regulation – Ellos Group Date of final decision: 2022-03-29 AB Date of translation: 2022-03-31 Final decision of the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) finds that Ellos Group AB has processed personal data in breach of Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection 1 Regulation (GDPR) by failing to take appropriate technical and organizational measures until 21 May 2021 to ensure an appropriate level of security for the company’s “merge customer” process. 2 The Authority for Privacy Protection issues Ellos Group AB a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR for the infringement of Article 32(1) of the GDPR. Report on the supervisory report The Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) has initiated supervision regarding Ellos Group AB (Ellos or the company) due to a complaint. The complaint has been submitted to IMY, as responsible supervisory authority for the company’s operations pursuant to Article 56 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The handover has been made from the supervisory authority of the country where the complainant has lodged their complaint (Norway) in accordance with the Regulation’s provisions on cooperation in cross-border processing. The investigation in the case has been carried out through correspondence. In the light of a complaint relating to cross-border processing, IMY has used the mechanisms for cooperation and consistency contained in Chapter VII GDPR. The supervisory authorities concerned have been the data protection authorities in Norway, Denmark and Finland.

Phone: 2The “Merge customer” process means hat two or more accounts on a website canto one, in case a 08-657 61 00 person establishes several accounts with the same personal data.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: XXX 2(5) Date:2022-03-29 The complaint It is stated in the complaint that the complainant wished to assist their cousin in receiving an order from Ellos. The cousin therefore used the complainant’s postal address when placing the order. A few days later, when the complainant tried to log into their Ellos account, the account was deleted or blocked. The complainant’s cousin was then able to access, through their account, the complainant’s purchase history. The complainant has been in contact with the company’s customer service but has not had the problem solved. The complainant considers that there is a lack of safety. The complainant also states that they could have had their credit card details registered in their customer account, which they did not have. What Ellos has stated Ellos has mainly stated the following. Ellos is the data controller for the processing to which the complaint relates. The company has a process called “merge customer” which means that when a new customer profile is created and the new profile consists of identical data already registered in an existing customer profile, the existing customer profile is merged with the new one. In creating an account, the complainant’s cousin used the complainant’s first name, surname, street name, street number and postcode. The complainant’s customer profile was then merged with the new customer profile created by the complainant’s cousin. According to the company, the purpose of the “merge customer” process is to merge user accounts if there is reason to assume that a customer does not remember their login details and therefore registers again. This is done in order to limit the processing of personal data by the company to updated and current data. The process was introduced as a more privacy-friendly option when the GDPR entered into force, in order not to use social security numbers as an identifier. When the accounts of the complainant and their cousin were merged and the cousin tried to place an order from the new account, an e-mail was sent to the previously registered e-mail address, i.e. the complainant’s e-mail, so that the ordering process could be interrupted if the wrong person had attempted to place the order. When the complainant contacted Ellos and stated that the order was placed by someone else (the cousin), the account was temporarily blocked. At the time when the “merge customer” process took place, the complainant’s cousin did get access to the complainant’s purchase and return history. However, the cousin did not have access to invoices, payment card details or other information on payments. Ellos states that, after receiving IMY’s inspection letter, it has taken steps to ensure that the purchase history is not available in case the “merge customer process” is activated. Ellos further states that it is working on implementing corresponding security measures regarding access to the return history. According to the company, the implementation is expected to be completed in the near future. The company also states that they intend to contact the complainant in order to provide information on how the complainant can lift the block on its account.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: XXX 3(5) Date:2022-03-29 Justification of the decision Applicable provisions, etc. Any processing of personal data must comply with the fundamental principles set out in Article 5 of the GDPR. One of these is the requirement of security under Article 5(1)(f). It follows that personal data must be processed in such a way as to ensure appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures. Article 32 regulates the security of processing. Paragraph 1 requires the controller, taking into account the latest developments, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks, of varying probability and severity, to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. According to Article 32(2), when assessing the appropriate level of security, account shall be taken in particular of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. Assessment of the Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) Has the company infringed Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation? IMY notes, first of all, that Ellos Group AB, after the supervision started on 21 May 2021, has taken steps to ensure that the purchase history is not available upon activation of the “merge customer process” and intends to take measures to ensure that the return history is not available. The investigation has not shown that there is reason for IMY to question the use of the “merge customer” process based on the company’s purpose of limiting the company’s processing to current and updated personal data, after the abovementioned improvements have been made. However, IMY has found that the “merge customer process” prior to the start of supervision on 21 May 2021 was designed in such a way that a customer’s purchase and return history could be made available to unauthorised persons by creating a new account with an existing customer’s first name, surname, street name, street code and postal code. Since the information required to create a new account was publicly available in open sources, for example in online directory services, information on customers’ buying habits has not been sufficiently protected against unauthorised disclosure. According to IMY’s assessment, the deficiency should have been detected at an early stage prior to the start of the processing of personal data. Ellos Group AB has thus processed personal data in breach of Article 32(1) of the GDPR. Choice of corrective measure It follows from Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83(2) of the GDPR that the IMY has the power to impose administrative fines in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the circumstances of the case, administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or in place of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2), such as injunctions andPrivacy Protection Authority Our ref: XXX 4(5) Date:2022-03-29 prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83(2) provides which factors are to be taken into account when deciding on administrative fines and in determining the amount of the fine. In the case of a minor infringement, as stated in recital 148, IMY may, instead of imposing a fine, issue a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b). Factors to consider is the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement and past relevant infringements. IMY notes the following relevant facts. The company has taken measures to protect information about customers’ buying habits from unauthorised disclosure. Neither sensitive nor integrity-sensitive data has been involved. The infringement was committed negligently, affected one person and, when the company understood the complainant's intention, it took action. IMY has not previously established that the company has infringed the GDPR. Against this background IMY considers that it is a minor infringement within the meaning of recital 148 and that Ellos Group AB must be given a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR.

The Privacy Protection Authority decides with the support of articles 58.2 and 83 i data protection regulation that Avanza Bank AB must pay an administrative sanction fee of 15,000,000 (fifteen million) kroner for the violations of articles 5.1 f and 32.1 of the data protection regulation. Account of the supervisory matter Starting point for supervision The Swedish Privacy Agency (IMY) received on June 8, 2021, a notification about a personal data incident from Avanza Bank AB (the bank). The report showed that personal data of 500,001 – 1 million during the period from November 15, 2019 to with June 2, 2021 erroneously transferred to the bank's partner Facebook (now Meta). Among the data transferred were social security numbers, loan amounts and account number. The background to the incident was that the bank started using Meta's service Facebook- the pixel (now the Meta pixel) in order to optimize the bank's marketing. During 2019 Meta developed a new sub-function within the Meta pixel, called Automatic Advanced Mailing address: Matching (AAM). The incorrect transfer of personal data was caused by the Box 8114 the new AAM feature was activated by the bank by mistake. The bank became aware of 104 20 Stockholm the transfer via external information. As soon as the bank became aware of the incident Website: the bank deactivated the Meta pixel in its entirety. www.imy.se E-mail: imy@imy.se 1 European Parliament and Council Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with Telephone: regarding the processing of personal data and on the free flow of such data and on the cancellation of 08-657 61 00 directive 95/46/EC (general data protection regulation). The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2021-5544 2(15) Date: 2024-06-24 Against the background of the information in the notification about the personal data incident, IMY started supervision of the bank. The supervision has been limited to what the bank has undertaken appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect website visitors and app users' personal data in accordance with articles 5.1 f and 32.1 i data protection regulation during the period from 15 November 2019 to 2 June 2021. What the bank has stated The bank has essentially stated the following regarding the issues that are the subject of IMY's examination. Personal data responsibility The bank is responsible for personal data for the introduction of the Meta pixel and the subsequent one the transfer of personal data to Meta. The original implementation of the Meta pixel The bank has routines to ensure correct processing of personal data before, i in connection with and after the introduction of new functions on the website. These routines are formalized and documented in the bank's governing documents. According to the bank procedures to ensure correct processing of personal data must initially before each new or changed personal data processing, a review is made and assessment of the planned treatment to ensure that it meets the requirements of data protection regulation. The review is done with the help of, among other things, a documented template for personal data processing which contains several steps which the employee who is responsible for the introduction of a new or changed personal data processing must go through. The steps mean, among other things, that it must a risk analysis of the treatment is carried out, a legal basis must be able to be established and it must ensure that those registered are given correct information about the new one the processing of personal data. Furthermore, the processing must be entered into the bank's register list. The Meta pixel is an analytics tool provided by Meta that helps to measure the effectiveness of the bank's Facebook advertising. The meta pixel transferred and linked a website visitor's activity and behavior on the bank's website with a unique registered user of any of Meta's services. the purpose with introducing and using the Meta pixel was to optimize the bank's marketing. The purpose of the personal data processing was to use targeted advertising Facebook and be able to market the bank to a relevant target group. The meta pixel enabled more relevant marketing to be produced by the marketing could be based on information about which pages on the bank's website as a person visited. Before the bank started the collaboration with Meta, an approval process was carried out where functions at the bank within risk, compliance, legal and information security was involved. Within the framework of this process, issues of bank secrecy were addressed and personal data processing. It was only information about a person's visits web pages, IP address and information about certain unique events, e.g. product selection and searches on the website, which were necessary to process for the purpose in question. Data Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-5544 3(15) Date: 2024-06-24 Activation of new sub-functions in the Meta pixel In 2019, Meta developed the Meta pixel service by also providing the Automatic Advanced Matching (“AAM”) function. This is a sub-function within Meta- the pixel. In addition to AAM, the Meta pixel also offers the Automatic Events feature (""AH"") which can be activated manually and which then tries to detect on its own and capture events and interactions, such as clicks, searches and menu selections, at visit the company's website or in the app. In 2019, the bank's legal department received a request from the marketing department about the opportunity to use one of Meta's functions through which customer data would transferred to Meta. The bank's legal department found that the function in question could not is implemented. It is further the bank's view that if an implementation of a function as AAM would have been subject to internal processes and procedures had it led to the assessment that the bank had not been able to accept the terms and that it did not would be possible to use the function. This is because the function risks involve a transfer of data to Meta that the bank cannot legally carry out in its banking. It has never been the bank's intention to use the functions AAM and AH. The bank has not been able to verify how the functions have been activated. Should the feature have activated by an employee of the bank, it is the bank's opinion that it has taken place mistake. The bank has not taken any decision to activate the AAM function. The bank's transfer of personal data via the AAM function to Meta Automatic Advanced Matching (AAM) feature The function AAM transmitted data in hashed form (with the hashing function SHA256) to Meta if the user filled in one of the five different forms on the bank's website or in the bank's mobile app. Two forms were in the new customer flow (open for visitors, where the visitor intended to become a customer). Three forms related to mortgages and was behind login and could only transfer data from existing customers who entered into a customer agreement with the bank. In order for the data to be transferred, it was required so that a person was logged in to the bank's website and that the person agreed to marketing cookies at the bank. If these conditions were not met AAM was not activated and no data was transferred. If the conditions were met, the following hashed data could be transferred to Meta: • Social security number • Contact information, such as phone number, email address, postal code and postal address • Loan amount on existing loan • Employer • Form of employment • Account number 2IMY's addition: Hashing is a one-way cryptographic function that can be used to accomplish pseudonymization, which is a possible security measure according to Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation, by personal data is replaced with a so-called hash sum. This means that the replaced personal data is not available in plain text and that additional information is needed to be able to identify the registered person. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2021-5544 4(15) Date: 2024-06-24 By inadvertently activating the AAM feature by the bank, the Meta pixel was able to match they hashed the data with visitors' behavior on the site for profiling. This made it possible to get a more detailed picture of the visitors. Profiling applied only the bank's marketing and was not used by Meta for its own, or others actors' business purposes. Exactly how AAM has affected advertising is not established. That this resulted in directed advertising cannot be excluded. The Automatic Events (AH) feature The AH function passed information in plain text to Meta when a user navigated on the bank's website or in the mobile app. A condition for transfer was that the user agreed to marketing cookies at the bank and was logged in as customer of the bank (with one exception, see below). The data that was transferred in clear text to Meta was unknowingly transferred as it did not exist any intention to show the information to anyone other than the customer. It was from browser or app on the customer's device that the transfer took place and that because of three main factors: 1) The function inadvertently activated by the bank at Meta also follows how a users move on a site/mobile (convert). To do so is sent information about which ""buttons"" – that is, elements on the page/screen – the user presses when he navigates on the site/in the app. Meta accordingly collects information that tells you which button presses take place to understand which context the user converts in. For example, Meta wants to understand that the customer buys something at print on a button with the text ""Buy"" even if the advertiser has not picked up the buy button as a conversion. This information was sent to Meta. 2) The bank uses elements that Meta perceives as buttons, e.g. button marked boxes and drop-down menus, in their code to present certain information to the bank's user. This mainly applies when there are elements on the site/apps that can be accessed press to e.g. show more information. Often these appear as a smaller visual elements that become larger when you press them, and then show more information. When users have pressed these elements to see more information, it has been recorded as regular keystrokes of Meta's script (Meta pixel IMY's note). The script has then compiled the information and sent it to Meta as a registered keystroke. 3) Information about keystrokes is not pseudonymized (IMY's note is hashed) by Meta the way other information they collect. These three factors together have caused certain information to be sent to Meta i plain text. It was thus a combination of the (incorrectly) activated functionality along with Meta's handling of button presses and a specific technical solution from the bank that caused the transfer to Meta. In summary, AH analyzed which buttons on the website and mobile app which the user pressed to then make suggestions about marketing on Facebook. The bank's transfer of data via AH arose because the bank categorized visual fields such as buttons on the website and in the mobile app code. Via AH could the following categories of data are transferred to Meta in plain text: The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2021-5544 5(15) Date: 2024-06-24 • Securities holdings and value, such as amount available for purchase, withdrawal and value development • Information on loan amount • Account number and credit limit • Fees, taxes and current interest rates • Current orders and today's close • Company signatory and bank from which the pension is transferred • Email address and social security number The majority of data transmitted via AH came from buttons behind logged in location with the bank, i.e. buttons that were only shown to customers who signed up customer agreement with the bank. In one place on the bank's website, however, there were expandables panels in the flow for signing occupational pensions, both for individual companies and for limited company, which was open to all visitors, i.e. also information from one limited number of visitors without a customer agreement with the bank and who were therefore not logged in. Measures taken after the personal data incident Meta has confirmed to the bank that the personal data processed has been deleted at Meta in a way that does not allow Meta to reproduce them. The bank's opinion is that the transfer of the data did not entail any damage or risk for the data subjects because Meta did not use the data for its own purposes or transferred them on and that the data is deleted. All information has been transferred by The Meta pixel for Meta and the bank's own advertising account with Meta. In order to detect outgoing traffic, the bank has now established a process for how the bank introduces and manages third-party scripts. It describes how these scripts should are evaluated from a security and integrity perspective and how they are maintained long term. The bank has also moved the scripts from the third-party suppliers to the bank's own system to avoid changes in the script being introduced without the bank draws attention to it. The bank has also supplemented internal guidelines to more clearly describe the error scenario, how it is avoided and what expectations are incumbent on the bank's development team when they handles this type of product. In addition to this, the bank has implemented additional governing documents and routines aimed at to ensure correct processing of personal data. These governing documents contains, among other things, requirements and guidelines in relation to the processing of personal data before, in connection with and after the introduction of new functions on the bank's website. Justification of the decision Applicable regulations, etc. It follows from Article 95 of the Data Protection Regulation that the Data Protection Regulation shall not entail any additional obligations for natural or legal persons who processes personal data, for such areas that are already covered by obligations of the Swedish Data Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-5544 6(15) Date: 2024-06-24 3 according to the so-called eData protection directive. The eData Protection Directive has been implemented in Swedish law through the Act (2003:389) on Electronic Communications (LEK), including other collection of data through cookies is regulated. According to ch. 9 Section 28 LEK, which implements Article 5.3 of the eData Protection Directive, receives data stored in or retrieved from a subscriber's or user's terminal equipment only if the subscriber or user gets access to information about the purpose of the treatment and consent to it. Furthermore, it appears that this does not prevent such storage or access needed to transmit an electronic message via a electronic communication network or which is necessary to provide a service which the user or subscriber has expressly requested. LEK entered into force on 22 August 2022. During the time in question in the case, however, the same requirements applied according to 6 ch. Section 18 of the Act on (2003:389) on electronic communications. It is Postal and The Swedish Telecom Agency, which is the supervisory authority according to LEK (chapter 1 § 5 of the regulation (2022:511) on electronic communication). The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has commented on the interaction between eData Protection Directive and the Data Protection Regulation. From the opinion, i.a. follows that it national supervisory authority appointed according to the eData Protection Directive is alone competent to monitor compliance with the Directive. However, the supervisory authority is according to data protection regulation competent supervisory authority for the processing that does not regulated in particular in the eData Protection Directive.4 According to Article 4.7 of the Data Protection Regulation, the person in charge of personal data is a physical or legal person, public authority, institution or other body which alone or together with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. If the purposes and means of the processing are determined by Union law or the national law of the Member States can the personal data controller or the special criteria for how he is to be appointed are prescribed in Union law or in national law of the Member States. The personal data controller is responsible for and must be able to demonstrate that the basic the principles in Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation are followed. This is apparent from Article 5.2 i the data protection regulation (principle of liability). According to Article 5.1 f of the data protection regulation, personal data must be processed in one way which ensures appropriate security for the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unauthorized processing and against loss, destruction or damage by accident, using appropriate technical or organizational measures. It follows from Article 32.1 of the data protection regulation that the person in charge of personal data must take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a safety level that is appropriate in relation to the risk of the treatment. At the assessment of which technical and organizational measures are appropriate must data controller take into account the latest developments, implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment as well as the risks for rights and freedoms of natural persons. 3 Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 on the processing of personal data and privacy protection in the electronic communications sector (Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications). 4Opinion 5/2019 on the interaction between the directive on privacy and electronic communications and the general the data protection regulation, especially with regard to the competence, tasks and powers of the data protection authorities, adopted on 12 March 2019, paragraphs 68 and 69. The Swedish Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-5544 7(15) Date: 2024-06-24 According to Article 32(1), appropriate safeguards include, where appropriate, a) pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data, b) the ability to continuously ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of treatment systems and services, c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data i reasonable time in the event of a physical or technical incident, and d) a procedure for regularly testing, examining and evaluating effectiveness in the technical and organizational measures that must ensure the safety of the treatment. According to article 32.2 of the data protection regulation, when assessing the appropriate security level special consideration is given to the risks that the treatment entails, in particular for accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or for unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise treated. According to ch. 3 Section 10 of the law (2018:218) with supplementary regulations to the EU's data protection regulation, social security numbers and coordination numbers may be processed without consent only when it is clearly justified with regard to the purpose of the processing, the importance of a secure identification or any other reasonable reason. From ch. 1 Section 10 first paragraph of the Act (2004:297) on banking and financing operations (Banking Act) states that individuals' relationships with credit institutions may not be obtained without authorization cleared. The Swedish Privacy Protection Authority's assessment From the investigation in the case it appears that two functions in the analysis tool Meta-pixeln inadvertently activated by the bank. As a result of the features being activated personal data about a large number of people who were logged on to the bank's website or in the bank's app unauthorized transferred to Meta. In some cases also have personal data regarding people who visited the website or app and used a specific service without having been logged in transferred. It is mainly the bank's own customers who have affected by the transfer. The personal data transferred has included, among other things social security number and extensive financial information. The information, including detailed information about customers' finances, has in several cases been transmitted in plain text. According to the bank, it has not been possible to verify afterwards how the functions activated or by whom. IMY initially takes a position on whether the data protection regulation is applicable and whether IMY is the competent supervisory authority. IMY is the competent supervisory authority IMY's review aims at a situation where information about people, mainly customers who were logged in to the bank, inadvertently transferred by the Meta pixel to Meta i in connection with their visiting different parts of the bank's website. This one information management does not mean that data is stored in or retrieved from a subscriber's or user's terminal equipment and is therefore not covered by Chapter 9 Section 28 of LEK or previously applicable corresponding provision in the law (2003:389) on electronic communication. IMY thus states that the data protection regulation is the Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2021-5544 8(15) Date: 2024-06-24 applicable to the personal data processing in question and that IMY is authorized supervisory authority. It can also be stated that IMY's review concerns the bank have taken sufficient security measures, which is not something that is specifically regulated in LEK. Even that relationship thus means that IMY is the competent supervisory authority. IMY then assesses the issue of personal data responsibility and whether the bank has taken action appropriate security measures according to articles 5.1 f and 32 of the data protection regulation for to protect the personal data of affected website visitors and app users. The bank is responsible for personal data The bank has stated that the bank is responsible for personal data for it personal data processing reviewed in the case. The investigation shows that the purpose with implementing and using the Meta pixel has been to optimize the bank's marketing. By processing information about e.g. visited by a person web pages, searches and product selection have the bank's marketing on Meta's service Facebook could thus be optimized. IMY notes that the bank has determined the purpose and means for the processing of the personal data, i.e. how and why the personal data is to be processed. IMY assesses that it is the bank which according to Article 4.7 of the data protection regulation is personal data controller for the personal data processing covered by the supervision. The treatment involved a high risk and required a high level of protection According to Article 32 of the data protection regulation, the bank has an obligation to protect them personal data that the bank processes by taking appropriate technical and organizational measures. The measures must ensure an appropriate level of security. At the assessment of which level of security is appropriate shall be the responsibility of the personal data controller take into account the costs, the nature, extent, context and purpose of the processing and the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons that the processing entails. From ch. 1 Section 10 first paragraph of the Banking Act follows that the person who is or has been connected to a bank may not unauthorizedly disclose information relating to a bank customer's dealings with the bank. The information that a certain person is a customer of the bank or not is also covered the duty of confidentiality. These legal requirements on confidentiality thus apply in the bank's operations. It places high demands on the protection of the personal data processed in the bank's Operation. IMY notes that the data that was handled consisted of, among other things, special personal data worthy of protection, namely social security numbers, which may only be processed under certain conditions. There has also been a question of financial data, such as information on account number, securities holdings, loan amount, and credit limit, for which the data subjects have legitimate expectations of a high degree of confidentiality and a robust protection against unauthorized access. The data transferred has been covered by statutory duty of confidentiality. The processing of personal data has taken place within the framework of the bank's core business, which entails even higher requirements for the level of protection. The bank should have had good ability to ensure a security that was suitable from the outside the scope and sensitivity of the treatment. With regard, among other things, to the fact that the data processed by the bank has been deleted protective nature and affected a very large number of people has the bank's treatment of the personal data in total meant a high risk for natural persons The Swedish Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-5544 9(15) Date: 2024-06-24 rights and freedoms. The nature, extent and context of the treatment therefore have entailed a requirement for a high level of protection for the data. The measures would, among other things, ensure that the personal data was protected against unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access. The bank has not taken sufficient measures to protect the data IMY notes initially that the relationship that the bank transferred the relevant the information to Meta means that the information has not actually been protected against unauthorized disclosure. The bank's information shows that it has formalized procedures to ensure a correct processing of personal data before, in connection with and after the introduction of new functions on the website and that these procedures are documented in the bank's governing document. IMY notes that the bank thus had organizational measures in place in the form of procedures documented in the bank's governing documents. However, the bank currently has the case did not follow its procedures. The bank has had the Meta pixel inserted on parts of the bank's website and app that were intended only for logged-in customers and prospects customers. The two functions AAM and AH in the Meta pixel have subsequently been activated without the bank was aware of it. As a consequence of the fact that the bank upon the introduction of these functions did not follow their routines and documented what happened, it has not been possible for the bank to subsequently verify how or by whom these functions was activated. As a result of the two functions AAM and AH being activated without the bank's knowledge has an unauthorized disclosure of information subject to confidentiality and an unauthorized transfer of personal data has taken place to Meta. This went on for just over a year and a half. To the clearing and the unauthorized transfer stopped was not due to the bank itself paying attention to what was going on, but that the bank received via an external source knowledge of it. The bank has thus lacked the ability to detect the clearing of and the ongoing one the transfer of personal data to Meta. IMY believes that the bank should have had one such systematic security work that this would have been discovered by the bank. One such security work involves checks being carried out with some regularity. Because the bank has only had routines to follow up on documented changes carried out according to established procedures, the bank has lacked the ability to detect and address changes that, as in the current case, were carried out without the routines followed. Against this background, IMY states that the bank has lacked technical and organizational security procedures to systematically follow up and detect accidental changes in their systems. As a result of the bank not applying its organizational security routines when the bank introduced the functions AAM and AH, partly lacking organizational and technical ones security procedures to detect transmissions have personal data of a large number persons unauthorized transferred to Meta. The investigation shows that there has been a question of personal data of approximately 500,000 – 1,000,000 people. In summary, IMY notes that the bank, when using the Meta pixel, does not has taken sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure a security level that was appropriate in relation to the risk. This means that the bank under the Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: DI-2021-5544 10(15) Date: 2024-06-24 the period from 15 November 2019 to 2 June 2021 has processed personal data in violation of Article 32.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. According to the basic security principle in Article 5.1 f of the data protection regulation personal data must be processed in a way that ensures appropriate security for the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unauthorized processing and against loss, destruction or accidental damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures. Through what happened has information about the bank's customers, for example information about social security numbers, account numbers, securities holdings, loan amount and credit limit, transferred to Meta in plain text. In addition, certain information has been transferred in hashed form, which enabled matching with personal data at Meta. It has been a matter of information that is covered by statutory duty of confidentiality. Loss of control of banking information can mean a lot risk to the freedoms and rights of the data subjects. That the matter concerns bank information and that the personal data has also predominantly been cleared and transferred in plain text from According to IMY, a mode logged in for the customers means that what happened is particularly serious. The bank's failure to follow its formalized procedures and lack of ability to discover the unauthorized transfer of personal data is therefore deemed to be of such serious type that the deficiency also involves a violation of Article 5.1 f i data protection regulation. Choice of intervention Legal regulation In the event of violations of the data protection regulation, IMY has a number of corrective measures powers, including reprimands, injunctions and penalty charges. It follows from article 58.2 a–j of the data protection regulation. IMY shall impose penalty fees in addition to or instead of other corrective measures referred to in Article 58(2), depending the circumstances of each individual case. Each supervisory authority must ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty charges in each individual case are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The stated in Article 83.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. In Article 83.2, the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether an administrative penalty fee must be imposed and what can affect the size of the penalty fee. Of significance for the assessment of the seriousness of the violation is, among other things, its nature, severity and duration. According to Article 83.4, in the event of violations of, among other things, Article 32, it must be imposed administrative penalty fees of up to EUR 10,000,000 or, if one applies company, of up to two percent of the total global annual turnover during previous budget year, depending on which value is the highest. According to Article 83.5, in the event of violations of, among other things, Article 5, it must be imposed administrative penalty fees of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, if one applies companies, of up to four percent of the total global annual turnover during previous budget year, depending on which value is the highest. Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-5544 11(15) Date: 2024-06-24 The EDPB has adopted guidelines on the calculation of administrative penalty fees according to the data protection regulation which aims to create a harmonized method and principles 5 for calculation of penalty fees. If it is a question of a minor violation, IMY receives according to what is stated in reason 148 i instead of imposing a penalty charge, issue a reprimand in accordance with Article 58.2 b i the regulation. IMY's assessment A penalty fee must be imposed IMY has made the assessment that the bank has processed personal data in violation of article 32.1 of the data protection regulation and that the violation is of such a serious nature that it is also a question of a violation of the principles of integrity and confidentiality in Article 5.1 f. The violation has occurred through the bank's processing of personal data with a insufficient level of security, which has led to, among other things, financial information about around 500,000 - 1,000,000 people were unauthorized transferred to Meta for just over a year and half a year's time. The bank has also lacked the ability to detect during this time the transfer of personal data to Meta. IMY believes that the bank should have had one such systematic security work that the transfer of personal data would have discovered in connection with a regular check. The unauthorized transfer has entailed a high risk for the freedoms and rights of the registered, among other things loss of confidentiality of data worthy of protection. Against this background, IMY assesses that it is not a question of such minor violations as referred to in reason 148 i data protection regulation. The European Court of Justice has clarified that it is required that the person in charge of personal data has committed a Violation intentionally or negligently to administrative penalty fees must be enforceable according to the data protection regulation. The European Court of Justice has stated that data controllers may be subject to penalty fees for actions if they cannot are deemed to have been unaware that the conduct constituted a breach, regardless of whether they were aware that they violated the provisions of the data protection regulation. 6 According to the principle of responsibility which is expressed, among other things, in Article 5.2 i the data protection regulation shall the person responsible for the processing of personal data ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing is compatible with the data protection regulation. IMY thus states that the bank is responsible for the personal data being processed in the business, is processed in a way that ensures an appropriate level of security. IMY has established during its examination that the bank did not live up to the requirements that the data protection regulation stipulates in this regard. The bank cannot be considered to have been unaware that its actions entailed a breach of the regulation. The 5 EDPB's guidelines Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR, adopted on 24 May 6023. against Valstybinė daemono apogos inspekcija of December 5, 2023, point 81 prie Sveikatos apogos ministrijos and judgment in case C 807/21 Deutsche Wohnen of 5 December 2023, paragraph 76Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten Diary number: DI-2021-5544 12(15) Date: 2024-06-24 there are therefore prerequisites for imposing an administrative on the bank penalty fee. 7 When determining the size of the penalty fee, IMY must take the circumstances into account as specified in Article 83.2 as well as ensuring that the administrative sanction fee is effective, proportionate and dissuasive. IMY states that violations of Article 5.1 f of the data protection regulation are covered by article 83.5 which means that a penalty fee of up to twenty million euros or four percentage of the global annual turnover in the previous fiscal year, depending whichever is higher, may be imposed. The Avanza group's annual turnover according to the parent company's consolidated accounts must is added as a basis for the calculation When determining the maximum amount of a penalty charge to be imposed on a company shall the definition of the concept of company be used as used by the EU Court of Justice application of Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU (see recital 150 i data protection regulation). It appears from the court's practice that this includes every entity that carries out economic activities, regardless of the legal form of the entity and the way of doing so financing as well as even if the unit in the legal sense consists of several physical or legal entities. The assessment of what constitutes a company must therefore be based on competition law definitions. The rules for group liability in EU competition law revolve around the concept of economic unity. A parent company and a subsidiary are considered one part of the same economic entity when the parent company exercises decisive influence over the subsidiary. The decisive influence (that is, control) can either be achieved by ownership or by contract. Jurisprudence shows that one hundred percent or almost one hundred percent ownership implies a presumption for control to be considered exist. However, the presumption can be rebutted if the company provides sufficient evidence to prove that the subsidiary acts independently on the market. To refute the presumption, the company must therefore provide evidence relating to the organizational, the financial and legal links between the subsidiary and its parent company which shows that they do not constitute an economic unit even though the parent company owns 100 percent 9 or almost 100 percent of the shares. Avanza Bank AB is a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent company Avanza Bank Holding AB (publ). According to the presumption described above, it is therefore the turnover for Avanza the group according to Avanza Bank Holding AB's (publ) consolidated accounts which shall is added as a basis for calculating the maximum penalty fee amount. From Avanza Bank Holding AB's consolidated accounts for 2023 it appears that the total global annual turnover was approx. SEK 4,716,000,000. Four percent of it annual turnover is approx. SEK 189,000,000. As this amount is less than the maximum amount as stated in Article 83(5) is the maximum penalty amount that can be determined in the case 20,000,000 euros. 7 For the assessment of negligence, see also the Court of Appeal in Stockholm's judgment of 11 March 2024 in case 2829-23 p.12. 8 The EU Court's judgment in case C-97/08 P Akzo Nobel NV et al. against the European Commission of 10 September 2009, paragraph 59- 61 Adapt/unify footnotes where we refer to the rulings of the European Court of Justice. 9 Cf. EDPB's guidelines Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR, point 125 and where reported rulings. The Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2021-5544 13(15) Date: 2024-06-24 The seriousness of the violation The EDPB's guidelines state that the supervisory authority must assess whether the violation is 10 of low, medium or high severity. IMY assesses that the following factors are important for the assessment of the infringement seriousness. IMY has established that the bank did not follow its procedures in connection with the functions AAM and AH in the Meta pixel were activated and that the bank has lacked the systematic security work required to detect the unauthorized disclosure and transfer of personal data to Meta. The current security flaws have led to an incident that has affected a large number of registrants and Meta has been able to take part in a large amount personal data, in many cases in plain text, which would not have been transferred to Meta. The information has included financial information and information about social security numbers, i.e. information that requires a high level of protection. The violation has been going on for a long time, from 15 November 2019 until 2 June 2021 when the bank became alerted to the unauthorized transfer of the data. The treatment of the personal data on the bank's website is part of the bank's core business there the information is subject to statutory confidentiality, which means that the breach must considered more serious than if this had not been the case. 11 IMY has established that the violation is so serious that it is in addition to a violation of Article 32.1 of the data protection regulation also constitutes a violation of it the fundamental principle of integrity and confidentiality according to Article 5.1 f. IMY assesses, overall, that the violation in question has a low degree of seriousness within the scope of violations of Article 5.1 f. In its assessment of the size of the penalty fee, IMY must also take these into account aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Article 83.2 i data protection regulation. IMY notes that the bank has taken certain measures to alleviate the damage suffered by the registrants according to Article 83.2 c. The bank closed immediately by the pixel functions when the bank was made aware of the transfer. The bank also contacted Meta to ensure that Meta had not processed the data for own purposes and that the data has been deleted at Meta. In addition to this have the bank has implemented additional control documents and routines that aim to ensure a correct processing of personal data. IMY assesses that the bank through these measures taken that could be expected given the nature of the treatment, purpose and scope. The measures taken therefore do not constitute mitigation factor. IMY states that no other circumstances have come to light either which affects IMY's assessment of the size of the sanction fee neither in aggravating manner or mitigating direction The penalty fee must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive The administrative penalty fee must be effective, proportionate and deterrent. This means that the amount must be determined so that the administrative the penalty fee leads to correction, that it provides a preventive effect and that it in addition, is proportionate in relation to current violations as well as to the supervised entity's ability to pay. 10 EDPB's guidelines Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR, point 60. 11 EDPB's guidelines Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR, point 53. Data Protection Authority Diary number: DI-2021-5544 14(15) Date: 2024-06-24 In light of the seriousness of the violation, IMY decides that the bank must pay a administrative sanction fee of SEK 15,000,000 for the identified violations. IMY considers this amount to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. This decision has been taken by acting general manager David Törngren after presentation by senior lawyer Hans Kärnlöf.

The treatment has also taken place in combat with Region Uppsala's own guidelines. This means that the hospital board does not have have taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of safety appropriate to the risk of treatment.  The hospital board has stored sensitive personal data in the e-mail hosting service Outlook. This means that the hospital board has not taken appropriate technical measures measures to ensure a level of safety appropriate to: the risk of treatment. The IMY decides on the basis of Articles 58 (2) and 83 of the Data Protection Ordinance and Chapter 6. § 2 of the Data Protection Act that the hospital board, for violation of Articles 5.1 f and 32.1 in the Data Protection Regulation, shall pay an administrative penalty fee of 1,600,000 (a million six hundred thousand) kronor. Report on the supervisory matter The starting point for the supervisory matter IMY decided to initiate an investigation against the Uppsala Region due to the region's notification on 7 May 2019 of personal data incident. IMY's review includes the processing of personal data carried out by the hospital board in connection with the University Hospital sending e-mails with patient information to patients and remittances in third countries. IMY's review also includes the storage of patient information in the Outlook e-mail hosting service. Within the framework of this supervision, the IMY has reviewed the matter in question the processing of personal data meets the security requirements set out in Articles 5 (1) (f) and 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. IMY has not reviewed the processing of personal data is compatible with the regulation in the Data Protection Regulation in other, for example, the provisions on the transfer of personal data to third countries. The Data Protection Ordinance came into force on 25 May 2018. IMY's supervision covers therefore the period from 25 May 2018 to 7 May 2019 (when notification was received). IMY has Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with concerning the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and on the repeal of Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Regulation). 2The Act (2018: 218) with supplementary provisions to the EU Data Protection Regulation. Page 2 of 11, Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2021-5595 3 (11) Date: 2022-01-26 has not reviewed the measures that the hospital board has stated that it has taken after the 7th May 2019. Information from the hospital board The Regional Board of the Uppsala Region has stated that it has the right to represent the region outwards. The hospital board has stated that it agrees with what the regional board has stated. The Hospital Board has, through the Regional Board, stated, among other things, the following. Personal data responsibility The hospital board is responsible for personal data for the processing of personal data occurs when e-mails are sent from and to patients or referrers abroad. The treatment takes place at the administration, Akademiska sjukhuset, which is located under the board the hospital board. This assessment is made in light of the fact that the hospital board is one independent managing authority that determines the purpose and means with personal data processing. E-mail sent unencrypted over an open network to third countries Processing of personal data in e-mail The academic hospital sends e-mails to patients and referrers (that is the home hospital) abroad at the initiative of the patient or the referrer. It's up to the patient or the referrer to choose how the information is to be submitted. The dialogue between the patient or the referrer and the Academic Hospital takes place mainly via E-mail. A patient from abroad who receives care at the Academic Hospital is registered in the main journal system Cosmic. Journal documents obtained from the patient about hens health status is scanned into Cosmic. Also the care performed at Akademiska the hospital is documented in Cosmic. When the care is terminated, the doctor in charge writes one compilation of care in a so-called Medical report in Cosmic. Medical report sent to the patient or referrer by mail, but if urgent, it is sent via e-mail. The purpose of the treatment is to provide highly specialized health care at Academic Hospital. The University Hospital sends an estimated 500-1,000 such e-mails per month. The emails were sent in 2018 to patients alternatively remittances in Lebanon, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, USA, Argentina, Australia, India, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Canada, Kenya and China. The e-mails usually contain journal documents and are forwarded to those concerned operations manager, specialist and in some cases other staff within Akademiska the hospital. Two people have access to the personal data. It's administrative staff with a care background who have access to personal data and staff covered by confidentiality. The personal data that is processed is information about health and information about the patient name, backup number, home address, e-mail address, telephone number, remittant, Page 3 of 11, Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2021-5595 4 (11) Date: 2022-01-26 affected area of activity and time of booked care. The registered are employees, patients and children. As far as employees are concerned, information about them only appears in sending and receiving email addresses. The processing of personal data concerned approximately 300 registered persons per year from 2014 onwards May 2019. The number applies to both people who have submitted requests for care and those treated at the Academic Hospital. The processing of personal data has been ongoing since 2014 and is still ongoing. The appears from a letter from the hospital board dated June 2, 2021. Encryption Personal data is sent unencrypted over an open network. This means that the transfer of the e-mail and the information in the e-mails are not protected by encryption. Since the introduction of Outlook, the hospital board has used Microsoft default settings, which means that the transmission of the e-mail takes place with it 3 Opportunistic Cryptographic Communication Protocol, OTLS. The National Board of Health and Welfare uses version 1.2 of the cryptographic communication protocol (TLS 1.2). This means that if the recipient's email provider does not have this version of TLS, select a previous version of TLS. If TLS is not supported by the recipient's e-mail provider, the e-mail the mail messages are unencrypted at the time of transmission. According to the hospital board, this is approx 1 of 9,000 emails. However, the hospital board has not verified exactly how many of these emails per day are sent unencrypted in this personal data processing. The hospital board has not fulfilled the requirements for the transfer of personal data in the open networks must be made in such a way that unauthorized persons cannot access them. This then the transfer was made unencrypted via Outlook. Control document According to Region Uppsala's governing document on handling e-mail gets sensitive personal data is not communicated via e-mail. Measures taken after the incident In September 2019, the Hospital Board introduced an encryption solution for files, which enabled secure email transfer. Systematic improvement work is underway and the hospital board has worked on one risk analysis and an impact assessment. Storage in the e-mail hosting service Outlook In Outlook, the e-mails are stored between the patient or remit and the Academic the hospital. The journal documents are also stored in Outlook. 3Opportunistic Transport Layer Security. Page 4 of 11, Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2021-5595 5 (11) Date: 2022-01-26 Justification of the decision Applicable rules The responsibility of the personal data controller He who alone or together with others decides the purposes and means for the processing of personal data is the person responsible for personal data. It is stated in Article 4 (7) in the Data Protection Regulation. The person responsible for personal data is responsible for and must be able to show that the basics the principles of Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation are complied with (Article 5 (2)). The person responsible for personal data is responsible for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the treatment is carried out in in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. The measures shall be implemented taking into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment and the risks, of varying degrees of probability and seriousness, for the freedoms and rights of natural persons. The measures must be reviewed and updated as necessary. It is stated in Article 24 (1) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. The requirement for security in the processing of personal data, etc. A basic principle for the processing of personal data is the requirement for security in accordance with Article 5 (1) (f) of the Data Protection Regulation, which states that personal data shall: processed in a way that ensures appropriate security for personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unauthorized treatment and against loss, destruction or damage by accident, using appropriate technical or organizational measures. Health information constitutes so-called sensitive personal data. It is forbidden to process such personal data in accordance with Article 9 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, unless the treatment is not covered by any of the exceptions in Article 9 (2) of the Regulation. It follows from Article 32 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation that the controller and the personal data assistant shall take appropriate technical and organizational measures to: ensure a level of safety that is appropriate in relation to the risk of the treatment. This must be done taking into account the latest developments, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment and the risks, of varying degrees of probability and seriousness, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In assessing the appropriate level of safety, special consideration shall be given to the risks involved the treatment entails, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or change or to unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data that transferred, stored or otherwise processed. It is clear from Article 32 (2) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. Recital 75 of the Data Protection Regulation sets out the factors to be taken into account the assessment of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons that may arise in the processing of personal data. Among other things, should be reconsidered the processing concerns personal data on health or on vulnerable natural persons, especially children, or if the processing involves a large number of personal data and applies to a large number of registered. Page 5 of 11, Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2021-5595 6 (11) Date: 2022-01-26 Recitals 39 and 83 also provide guidance on the more detailed meaning of the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation on security when processing personal data. IMY's assessment Personal data responsibility The National Board of Health and Welfare has stated that it is responsible for personal data for it personal data processing that takes place when e-mail is sent from the University Hospital to patients and remittances abroad. This is supported by the other investigation in the case. IMY therefore considers that the hospital board is responsible for personal data for the e- postal transfers in question. Furthermore, IMY assesses that The hospital board is also responsible for the processing of personal data which occurs during storage in the e-mail hosting service Outlook because the e-mail transmissions happens from there. Sensitive personal data has been sent unencrypted via the open network As the person responsible for personal data, the hospital board must take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security in relation to the risks (Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation). The personal data as treated must, for example, be protected against unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access. What is the appropriate level of security varies in relation to, among other things, the risks for the rights of natural persons which the treatment entails and the nature of the treatment, scope, context and purpose. In the assessment, it must, for example take into account the type of personal data being processed, such as data on health.4 The hospital board has sent a large number of personal data via e-mail to patients and remitters abroad. These are an estimated 500-1,000 sent e-mails mail messages per month. The current emails contained personal data on health that are sensitive personal data. Treatment of sensitive personal data can pose significant risks to personal privacy and therefore, strong protection is required in the processing of such data. This means that if such personal data sent by e-mail must be protected in such a way that unauthorized persons cannot take part in them. Personal data can, for example, be protected by encryption. The hospital board's information shows that the hospital board used a technology, so called OTLS, which means that the transmission of the e-mail is encrypted for that case receiving e-mail server supports TLS. If the receiving e-mail server does not support TLS, the transmission of the e-mail becomes unencrypted. This means that the hospital board uses a technology that is dependent on the receiver's technical settings, which means that the hospital board can not ensure that the transmission of the e-mail is encrypted. E- the mail has been sent externally (ie outside the Uppsala Region), which has resulted that it was not possible to ensure that the e-mail sent from the Academic Hospital received with an encryption that is appropriate in relation to the risk of the treatment. The National Board of Health and Welfare has itself stated that it has not verified how many of the the mail messages sent unencrypted via open network per day. In the present case, the information is sent in the emails without encryption, that is say the information has been read in plain text via the open network (internet). This means that 4See recitals 75 and 76 of the Data Protection Regulation. Page 6 of 11, Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2021-5595 7 (11) Date: 2022-01-26 unauthorized persons have been able to access the personal data in the e-mails and that other than intended recipients have been able to access the information both below the transmission, in cases where the recipient's e-mail server did not support TLS, and after the transmission of the e-mail. According to IMY, there is a risk that the data will come in wrong hands after the transfer, as the person sending the data would be able to write an incorrect recipient address \[1. IMY finds that the information in the emails should have been protected against unauthorized use disclosure or unauthorized access, and this regardless of the transmission of the e-mail been encrypted or not. The hospital board should have taken technical measures, to examples in the form of encryption, to protect personal data and thereby ensure an appropriate level of data protection. That a large number of sensitive personal data has been exposed to for a long time internet without protection against unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access, means according to IMY that the lack of security has been of such a serious nature that it also involves one infringement of Article 5 (1) (f) of the Data Protection Regulation. According to the hospital board, Region Uppsala's governing document on handling mail states and e-mail that sensitive personal data may not be communicated via e-mail. The hospital board has thus identified the risks of treating the sensitive personal data in e-mail entails but has not taken sufficient measures to comply guidelines. IMY thus finds that the hospital board has not taken the appropriate ones organizational measures required to ensure the safety of treatment. Overall, IMY finds that the hospital board, by not taking appropriate action technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security that is appropriate in relation to the risk of the processing, has processed personal data in violation with Articles 5 (1) (f) and 32 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. Sensitive personal data has been stored in Outlook The hospital board has stated that the medical records are also stored in Outlook in addition storage in the main journal system Cosmic. The journal documents contain personal information about health that is sensitive personal data. Processing of sensitive personal data can mean significant risks to privacy and therefore strong protection is required during treatment of such information. This means, among other things, that this personal data must protected in such a way that unauthorized persons cannot access them. The purpose of an email system (in this case Outlook) is to disseminate and communicate information. An e-mail system is exposed to the internet, which means that the information in the system risks becoming inaccessible to unauthorized persons. Outlook is therefore generally one inappropriate storage for sensitive personal data. By storing journal documents in Outlook, the current data has been exposed to one high risk that they will be disclosed or that unauthorized persons will gain access to them. This means that the hospital board has not taken the technical measures required under Article 32 i the Data Protection Regulation to ensure adequate data protection. That a large number of sensitive personal data has been exposed to for a long time internet without protection against unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access, means according to IMY \[1See the Swedish Data Inspectorate's report Reported personal data incidents 2019 (report 2020: 2). Page 7 of 11, Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2021-5595 8 (11) Date: 2022-01-26 that the lack of security has been of such a serious nature that it also involves one infringement of Article 5 (1) (f) of the Data Protection Regulation. In summary, IMY considers that the hospital board has not taken appropriate technical measures measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data stored in Outlook. As a result, the hospital board has not ensure a level of safety that is appropriate in relation to the risk of the treatment. The Hospital Board has thus processed the personal data in violation of Articles 5.1 f and 32.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. Choice of intervention Legal regulation In the event of violations of the Data Protection Regulation, the IMY has a number of corrections powers available under Article 58 (2) (a) to (j) of the Data Protection Regulation, inter alia reprimand, injunction and penalty fees. IMY shall impose penalty fees in addition to or in lieu of other corrective actions referred to in Article 58 (2), depending on the circumstances of each case. Member States may lay down rules on whether and to what extent administrative penalty fees can be imposed on public authorities. It is clear from Article 83 (7) (i) Regulation. Sweden has accordingly decided that the supervisory authority shall receive charge sanction fees by authorities. For infringements of, inter alia, Article 32, the fee amounts to a maximum of SEK 5,000,000. For infringements of, inter alia, Article 5 i According to the ordinance, the fee shall amount to a maximum of SEK 10,000,000. It appears from ch. 6 2 § of the Data Protection Act and Article 83 (4) and 83 (5) of the Data Protection Ordinance. If a personal data controller or a personal data assistant, with respect to a and the same or interconnected data processing, intentionally or by negligence violates several of the provisions of this Regulation may it the total amount of the administrative penalty fee does not exceed the amount determined for the most serious infringement. It is clear from Article 83 (3) (i) the Data Protection Regulation. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty fees in each individual case are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The provided for in Article 83 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. Article 83 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation sets out the factors to be taken into account in order to: decide whether to impose an administrative penalty fee, but also at determining the amount of the penalty fee. If it is a question of a smaller infringement may IMY as set out in recital 148 instead of imposing a issue a reprimand in accordance with Article 58 (2) (b) of the Regulation. Consideration shall taken to aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the case, such as the infringement character, degree of difficulty and duration as well as previous violations of relevance. Imposition of a penalty fee IMY has above assessed that the hospital board has violated Articles 5.1 f and 32.1 i the Data Protection Regulation. Violations of these provisions may, as is apparent above, give rise to penalty fees. Page 8 of 11, Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2021-5595 9 (11) Date: 2022-01-26 The violations have taken place because the hospital board has sent a large amount patient data via unencrypted e-mail via open network to patients and referrers in third country and because the patient data has been stored in Outlook. The personal data which were processed were sensitive personal data, which means a high risk for those freedoms and rights were registered. The treatments described in the case have taken place systematically and for a long time. The treatments via e-mail have also taken place in conflict with Region Uppsala's own guidelines. Taken together, these factors mean that one penalty fee should be imposed. IMY estimates that the treatments via e-mail and storage refer to two interconnected data processing in accordance with Article 83 (3) of the Data Protection Regulation. This because the treatments concern the handling of the same personal data in Outlook and refer to violation of the same provisions. In determining the size of the penalty fee, the IMY shall take into account both aggravating and mitigating circumstances and that the administrative penalty fee should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. It is aggravating that the personal data processing has been going on for a long time, that is say during the period under review from 25 May 2018 to 7 May 2019, and that the hospital board did not promptly take measures to protect personal data despite that the hospital board was aware of the shortcomings in safety. It is also aggravating that the treatments included a large amount of health information that was sent unencrypted via open network and stored in Outlook. It has been about between 500 and 1,000 e-mails per month that unauthorized persons have been able to access to via the internet and included about 300 registered per year. Through the information provided processed, the data subjects can be identified directly by name, contact details and health information. IMY therefore considers the nature, scope and nature of the data the dependent's dependency gives the hospital board a special responsibility to ensure appropriate protection of personal data, which has not happened. It is further aggravating that the treatments have taken place systematically and that they have taken place in contrary to Region Uppsala's own guidelines that sensitive personal data should not sent by e-mail. As a mitigating circumstance, it is taken into account that the hospital board introduced in September 2019 technical measures in the form of an encryption solution for files. IMY decides based on an overall assessment that the hospital board should be imposed on one administrative penalty fee of 1,600,000 (one million six hundred thousand) kronor. This decision was made by Director General Lena Lindgren Schelin after the presentation by lawyer Linda Hamidi. At the final hearing, the Chief Justice also has David Törngren, unit manager Malin Blixt and IT security specialist Ulrika Sundling participated.

The applicant requested, inter alia, information on warranty repairs, carried out by a car brand repair shop belonging to the company (the car repair shop). The company replied that information on warranty was not available from the company. What Volvo Personvagnar AB has stated The company has mainly stated the following. The company is the data controller for the processing to which the complaint relates. On 25 February 2020, the complainant submitted a request for access to personal data. The request concerned, inter alia, an invitation to provide information on the servicing of the complainant’s vehicle. On 3 March 2020, the car repair shop sent the complainant a copy of a service invoice. On 24 March 2020, the company sent a copy of the personal data containing information on the warranty repairs carried out, service on the vehicle and technical reports on the vehicle. On 2 April 2020, the complainant lodged a complaint to the company alleging that the car repair shop had indicated that the information on the warranty repair, could not be disclosed. On 14 April 2020, the complainant clearly stated that he wishes to have access to, inter alia, the following information: – correspondence between the complainant and the company’s customer service/carrier; – correspondence between the complainant and the workshops concerning the vehicle in question; – marketing; and – recall of vehicles; On 17 April 2020, the complainant received correspondence as set out above. At the same time, the company asked the complainant to clarify its request concerning marketing information and requests for correspondence with which country’s customer service was the subject of the request. On 14 May 2020, the complainant received a copy of the correspondence between the complainant, car repair shops and the company. On 17 June 2020, the complainant requested information on warranty repairs from the company. On 28 August 2020, a copy of the personal data was sent to the complainant with the following information on: – correspondence from the company’s customer service in the United Kingdom; – correspondence from the local Irish sales office including, inter alia, the date of the warranty repairs carried out;The Privacy Protection AuthoritRegistration number: DI-2021-6140 3(8) Date: 2022-05-13 – service performed for which the company has information, the vehicle (date of technical reports on the vehicles); and – a statement from a lawyer working for the company concerning what information the company doesn’t have and that the applicant needs to contact the car repair shop concerned. On 4 September 2020, the company informed the complainant that the company had requested the relevant car repair shop to provide information on service and warranty repairs. On 15 September 2021, the DPO sent a letter to the complainant and apologised for the handling of the request for information on warranty repair. In its reply, the company attached the following information. Data from the system QV90: – service history (date, metering, workshop and dealer), – roadside assistance insurance from the local system; – the next service date according to service intervals; – listing in free text about measures and warranty cases (date, metering, warranty case, so-called QB number), missing component, applied for costs from the workshop for work and materials, cost allocation (between sales company/importer and manufacturer). Information from the system of technical records from the time when the complainant owned the vehicle, as follows: – logs on the vehicle where it has been recorded in technical reports; – possible warranty cases (errors/problems that may occur on this vehicle and on which it is possible to call for a guarantee); – logs on completed warranty cases, reports such as problems with the vehicle where the workshop involves the support of the sales company and/or the support company. These reports are linked to the vehicle and the complainant. The company submits that the car repair shops are independent of the company. It is the car repair shops that have carried out warranty and service work on the complainant’s vehicles. It is for the car repair shops to provide the complainant with information on warranty and service work, as the workshops own the customer relationship and hold relevant information and data on such works. The complainant therefore needed to have a direct dialogue with the car repair shop on information concerning warranty and service provided. The company does not handle service or service invoices. Service is provided by the independent car repair shop and the car repair shop is data controller for the service information. The company points out that the reason why the data from the QV90 system and the technical notes were not sent to when the complainant in the first communication was due to the human factor. The company has now ensured that the mistake will not happen again. The company has been in constant communication with when the complainant and has attempted to respond to its various requests. The company points out when the complainant sought, in essence, information relating to the car repair invoice for a particular warranty and service work carried out, which is information to which the company did not have access to.The Privacy Protection Authority Registration number: DI-2021-6140 4(8) Date: 2022-05-13 Justification of the decision Applicable provisions, etc. Concept of personal data According to Article 4(1) of the GDPR, ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person The concept of ‘personal data’ may include all information, whether objective or subjective, provided that it ‘relates’ to a particular person, which it does if, by virtue of its content, purpose or effect, it is linked to that person. In the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Valsts ieņēmumu dienests, the Court held that the information requested by the Latvian tax authority, in particular data relating to the chassis numbers of the vehicles advertised on the operator’s web portal, constitutes personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the GDPR. 3 The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access, inter alia: 51. Additionally, the controller needs to assess whether the requests made by the requesting persons refer to all or parts of the information processed about them. Any limitation of the scope of a request to a specific provision of Art. 15 GDPR, made by the data subjects, must be clear and unambiguous. For example, if the data subjects require verbatim “information about the data processed in relation to them”, the controller should assume that the data subjects intend to exercise their full right under Art. 15(1) – (2) GDPR. Such a request should not be interpreted as meaning that the data subjects wish to receive only the categories of personal data that are being processed and to waive their right to receive the information listed in Art. 15(1)(a) to (h). This would be different, for example, where the data subjects wish, with regard to data which they specify, to have access to the source or origin of the personal data or to the specified period of storage. In such a case the controller may limit its reply to the specific information requested. 104. The words “personal data concerning him or her” should not be interpreted in an “overly restrictive” way by controllers, as the Art. 29 Working Party already stated with regard to the right to data portability. Transposed to the right of access, the EDPB considers for example that recordings of telephone conversations (and their transcription) between the data subject that requests access and the controller, may fall under the right of access provided that the latter are personal data. \[...\] 150. It is the responsibility of the controller to decide upon the appropriate form in which the personal data will be provided. The controller can, although is not necessarily obliged to, provide the documents which contain personal data about 2Judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union, Nowak, C-434/16, EU:C:2017:994, paragraphs 34-35. 3Judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union, Valsts, C-175/20, EU:C:2022:124, paragraphs 34 and 36.The Privacy Protection AuthorityRegistration number: DI-2021-6140 5(8) Date: 2022-05-13 the data subjects making the request, as such and in their original form. The controller can for example, on a case-by-case basis, provide access to a copy of medium given the need for transparency (for example, to verify the accuracy of the data held by the controller in the event of a request for access to the medical file or an audio recording whose transcript is disputed). However, the CJEU, in its interpretation of the right of access under the Directive 95/46/EC, stated that “for \[the right of access\] to be complied with, it is sufficient for the applicant to be provided with a full summary of those data in an intelligible form, that is, a form which allows him to become aware of those data and to check that they are accurate and processed in compliance with that directive, so that he may, where relevant, exercise the rights conferred on him”. Unlike the directive, the GDPR expressly contains an obligation to provide the data subject with a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. This, however, does not mean that the data subject always has the right to obtain a copy of the documents containing the personal data, but an unaltered copy of the personal data being processed in these documents. Such copy of the personal data could be provided through a compilation containing all personal data covered by the right of access as long as the compilation makes it possible for the data subject to be made aware and verify the lawfulness of the processing. Hence, there is no contradiction between the wording of the GDPR and the ruling by the CJEU regarding this matter. The word summary in the ruling should not be misinterpreted as meaning that the compilation would not encompass all data covered by the right of access, but is merely a way to present all that data without giving systematically access to the actual documents. Since the compilation needs to contain a copy of the personal data, it should be stressed that it cannot be made in a way that somehow alters or changes the content of the information. EDPB Guidelines 01/2020 on processing personal data in the context of connected 4 vehicles and mobility related applications, inter alia: 3. In addition, connected vehicles are generating increasing amounts of data, most of which can be considered personal data since they will relate to drivers or passengers. Even if the data collected by a connected car are not directly linked to a name, but to technical aspects and features of the vehicle, it will concern the driver or the passengers of the car. As an illustration, data relating to the driving style or the distance covered, data relating to the wear and tear on vehicle parts, location data or data collected by cameras may concern driver behaviour as well as information about other people who could be inside or data subjects that pass by. Such technical data are produced by a natural person, and permit his/her direct or indirect identification, by the data controller or by another person. The vehicle can be considered as a terminal that can be used by different users. Therefore, as for a personal computer, this potential plurality of users does not affect the personal nature of the data 29. Much of the data that is generated by a connected vehicle relate to a natural person that is identified or identifiable and thus constitute personal data. For instance, data include directly identifiable data (e.g., the driver’s complete identity), as well as indirectly identifiable data such as the details of journeys made, the vehicle usage data (e.g., data relating to driving style or the distance covered), or the vehicle’s technical data (e.g., data relating to the wear and tear on vehicle 4EDPB, Guidelines 01/2020 on processing staff data in the context of connected vehicles and mobility related applications, Version 2.0, adopted on 9 March 2021 following public consultation, paragraphs 3, 29 and 62; IMY translationThe Privacy Protection Authority Registration number: DI-2021-6140 6(8) Date: 2022-05-13 parts), which, by cross-referencing with other files and especially the vehicle identification number (VIN), can be related to a natural person. Personal data in connected vehicles can also include metadata, such as vehicle maintenance status. In other words, any data that can be associated with a natural person therefore fall into the scope of this document. 62. As noted in the introduction, most data associated with connected vehicles will be considered personal data to the extent that it is possible to link it to one or more identifiable individuals. This includes technical data concerning the vehicle’s movements (e.g., speed, distance travelled) as well concerning the vehicle’s condition (e.g., engine coolant temperature, engine RPM, tyre pressure). \[...\] In the preparatory work documents for the law ‘Road infrastructure charges and electronic toll systems’, the legislature noted that the very broad definition of personal data was the subject of discussion in the legislative file which resulted in the Law on road traffic registers and stated the following. In the field of road traffic there are both personal data and vehicle technical data. However, in some cases it may be difficult to determine to which category a particular task falls. A technical data of a vehicle should not be considered as personal data if it cannot be linked to the identity of the owner of the vehicle. On the other hand, an indication that a particular vehicle is subject to a driving ban refers to the owner of the vehicle in a specific way and it is therefore likely to be personal data. In the light of this statement, the Government considered in the 7 preparatory work for the Act on Congestion Tax that the registration number of a vehicle also relates to the owner of the vehicle in such a specific way that the task is to be regarded as personal data. The Government does not consider that there is now any reason to make a different assessment. In the literature, Öman states that vehicle registration numbers are examples of 8 information relating to an identifiable natural person. Right of access without undue delay The controller is obliged to provide any person who so requests with information on the processing or non-processing of personal data relating to the applicant. Processing such data shall, in accordance with Article 15 of the GDPR, provide the complainant with additional information as well as a copy of the personal data processed by the controller. According to Article 12(3) GDPR, the controller shall upon request without undue delay and in any event no later than one month after receiving the request for access and 9 respond to the data subject’s request. Assessment of the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) On the basis of the complaint in the case, IMY only examined the company’s conduct in the individual case and whether it provided a copy of the personal data relating to 5Prop. 2013/14:25 p. 85. 6Prop. 2000/01:95 p. 98. 7 8Prop. 2003/04:145 pp. 98 et seq.

European Data Protection Board Guidelines 01/2022 on data subjects’ rights — right of access, version 1.0, adopted on 18 January 2022.The Privacy Protection AuthorityRegistration number: DI-2021-6140 7(8) Date: 2022-05-13 the complainant without undue delay. Supervision does not apply if the company’s personal data processing is otherwise compatible with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The IMY considers that the information requested by the complainant on technical records and data from the vehicle guarantee, constitute personal data relating to the applicant, since they relate specifically to the applicant as the owner of the vehicle and may be used to identify the complainant. In so doing, the complainant is entitled to access the data from the company upon request in accordance with Article 15 of the GDPR, inter alia, the information set out in Article 15(1) and a copy of the data pursuant to Article 15(3). The complainant has stated that the request for access was made in March 2019. On the other hand, the company has states that the applicant’s request for access was made only on 25 February 2020. IMY finds no reason to question the company’s statements that the applicant’s request was received by the company on 25 February 2020. However, IMY considers that this request was sufficiently clear and clear to refer to all personal data relating to the complainant’s vehicles, including the above- mentioned data which the company made available to the applicant only on 15 September 2021. This is because the complainant indicated in its request the type of information about his vehicle for which the complainant requested data and that the controller should assume that, in the event of a request for access, the data subject 11 intends to exercise his or her full right pursuant Article 15(1) to (2) of the GDPR. The request has thus been met 17 months after the external deadline of one month for: to deal with the request in accordance with the general rule in Article 12(3). IMY therefore considers that Volvo Personvagnar AB has not dealt with the complainant’s request for access pursuant Article 15(3) without undue delay within the meaning of Article 12(3) of the GDPR. The fact that most of the information was disclosed earlier and that the company stated that the error was attributable to the human factor, does not cause any other assessment. In the light of the above, IMY concludes that Volvo Personvagnar has processed the complainant’s personal data in violation of Article 12(3) of the GDPR by not responding without undue delay to the complainant’s request of 25 February 2020 for access pursuant Article 15(3) only on 15 September 2021. Choice of corrective measure It follows from Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83(2) of the GDPR that the IMY has the power to impose administrative fines in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the circumstances of the case, administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or in place of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2), such as injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83(2) provides which factors are to be taken into account when deciding on administrative fines and in determining the amount of the fine. In the case of a minor infringement, as stated in recital 148, IMY may, instead of imposing a fine, issue a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b). Factors to consider is 10Cf. EDPB Opinion 01/2020 on Connected Vehicles, paragraphs 3, 29 and 62. 11Cf. EDPB Guidelines 01/2022 on data subjects’ rights — right of access, version 1.0, adopted on 18 January 2022, paragraph 51.The Privacy Protection AuthorityRegistration number: DI-2021-6140 8(8) Date: 2022-05-13 the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement and past relevant infringements. IMY notes the following relevant facts. The infringement has affected one person and the company has reviewed its procedures. The company essentially satisfied the complainant’s right of access without undue delay and has now also granted the complainant access to all his personal data. The Company has not received any corrective action for breach of GDPR. Against this background IMY considers that it is a minor infringement within the meaning of recital 148 and that Volvo Personvagnar AB must be given a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR.

DI-2021-10263. Only the Swedish version of the decision is deemed authentic. Registration number: Decision under the General Data DI-2021-10263, IMI case no. 185203, LDA-1085.1-1399/20-F Protection Regulation — Klarna Bank Date of decision: AB 2022-05-11 Decision of the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) The Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) finds that Klarna Bank AB is processing personal data in breach of Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation 1 (GDPR) by not complying with the complainant’s request of 22 December 2019 for information about the recipients to whom his personal data have been disclosed. The Authority for Privacy Protection issues Klarna Bank AB a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR for the infringement of Article 15 of the GDPR. Report on the supervisory case The case handling The Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) has initiated supervision regarding Klarna Bank AB (Klarna) due to a complaint. The complaint has been submitted to IMY, in its capacity as lead supervisory authority under Article 56 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The handover has been made by the supervisory authority of the country where the complainant has lodged his complaint (Germany) in accordance with the Regulation’s provisions on cooperation concerning cross-border processing. The investigation in the case has been carried out through correspondence. Since the complaint regards cross-border processing, IMY has used the mechanisms for cooperation and consistency contained in Chapter VII of the GDPR. The supervisory authorities concerned have been the data protection authorities in Germany, Denmark, Austria, Italy, Poland, and Finland. The complaint Postal address: The complainant mainly states the following. Box 8114 104 20 Stockholm Website: He has requested access to his personal data under Article 15 of the GDPR. The www.imy.se information he obtained from Klarna did not include all the information that he had E-mail: imy@imy.se 1 Telephone: Regulation (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).nd on the free movement of such data, 08-657 61 00Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten Diarienummer: DI-2021-10263 2(4) Datum: 2022-05-11 asked for since it lacked information about the recipients to whom his personal data had been disclosed. Even though the complainant came back with a request to know exactly which recipients his data had sent to, Klarna has not complied with this request. Due to the complaint, IMY has initiated supervision in order to examine if the complainant’s request has been complied with in accordance with Article 15 of the GDPR. What Klarna has stated Klarna states that it is the controller for the processing to which the complaint relates. th The information sent to the complainant on the 24 of January 2020 is in accordance with the obligations of the GDPR. Klarna has no duty to reply to the complainant’s access request in any other way that it did. The EDPB Guidelines 01/2022 on access th was adopted on the 18 of January 2022, i.e. two years after the complainant’s case regarding access request was closed. Justification of the decision Applicable provisions, etc. Article 15 of the GDPR provides that he data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data. The data subject shall also have the right to information about the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed (Article 15(1)(c)). Article 19 of the GDPR requires the controller to communicate any rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing carried out in accordance with Article 16, Article 17(1) and Article 18 to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. The controller shall inform the data subject about those recipients if the data subject requests it. According to Article 5 the controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, inter alia the obligation to processes personal data fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject. EDPB Guidelines 01/2022 on access state that concerning the question, if the controller is free to choose between information on recipients or on categories of recipients, it has to be recalled, that, already under Art. 13 and 14 GDPR information on the recipients or categories of recipients should be as concrete as possible in respect of the principles of transparency and fairness. The controller should therefore generally name the actual recipients unless it would only be possible to indicate the category of recipients. Nevertheless, sometimes naming the actual recipients is not yet possible at the time of the information under Art. 13 and 14 GDPR but only in a later stage, for example when an access request is made. The EDPB recalls in this regard,Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten Diarienummer: DI-2021-10263 3(4) Datum: 2022-05-11 that storing information relating to the actual recipients is necessary inter alia to be able to comply with the controller’s obligations under Art. 5(2) and 19 GDPR. 2 Assessment of the Authority for Privacy Protection The wording of Article 15(1)(c) of the GDPR does clarify if the controller is free to choose between information on actual recipients or on only categories of recipients. However, IMY concludes that Article 15(1)(c), read together with Article 19 and in light of the principles of fairness and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)) cannot be interpreted any other way than as a right of the data subject to, especially when explicitly requested, obtain from the controller information about the actual recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. IMY notes that the complainant has explicitly requested information about actual recipients. Klarna has not proved that this has proven impossible or to involve disproportionate effort. Klarna has thus processed the complainant’s personal data in violation of Article 15 of the GDPR. What Klarna has stated about that the EDPB Guidelines on access was adopted after the access request was complied with, does not lead to any other conclusion. IMY does not claim that Klarna has an obligation to comply with guidelines that was not available to Klarna at the time of the violation. IMY’s reason for citing the guidelines is to prove that there is wide support for IMY’s opinion, which follows from the wording of Article 19. Choice of corrective measure It follows from Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83(2) of the GDPR that the IMY has the power to impose administrative fines in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the circumstances of the case, administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or in place of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2), such as injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83(2) provides which factors are to be taken into account when deciding on administrative fines and in determining the amount of the fine. In the case of a minor infringement, as stated in recital 148, IMY may, instead of imposing a fine, issue a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b). Factors to consider is the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement and past relevant infringements. IMY notes that the violation has affected one person and has not involved sensitive data. Furthermore, Klarna has otherwise complied with the complainant’s request for access. Against this background IMY considers that it is a minor infringement within the meaning of recital 148 and that Klarna Bank AB must be given a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR for the established infringement. 2EDPB Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights -access, Version 1.0, adopted for public consultation on 18 January 2022, paragraph 115.Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten Diarienummer: DI-2021-10263 4(4) Datum: 2022-05-11 This decision has been approved by the specially appointed decision-maker after presentation by legal advisor How to appeal If you want to appeal the decision, you should write to the Authority for Privacy Protection.

Report on the supervisory report The Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) has initiated supervision regarding Klarna Bank AB (Klarna or the company) due to a complaint. The complaint has been submitted to IMY, as responsible supervisory authority pursuant to Article 56 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the supervisory authority in the Netherlands where the complainant has lodged their complaint in accordance with the Regulation’s provisions on cooperation in cross-border processing. The investigation in the case has been carried out through correspondence.

What Klarna has stated Klarna has mainly stated the following. Klarna is the data controller for the processing to which the complaint relates. The complainant’s request for erasure was received by Klarna on 18 November 2020, after which Klarna verified the applicant’s identity on 25 November 2020 and on 26 November 2020 requested a confirmation of the initiation of the erasure process. On 27 November 2020 the complainant submitted a confirmation, but this has not been brought to the attention of the case handler. Klarna sent a further request for confirmation on December 202020. On 24 January 2021, Klarna informed the complainant that the erasure process had been initiated and that the processing was delayed due to lower staffing during the Christmas and New Year holidays. On the same date, the process of erasure of the complainant’s personal data was completed. Klarna holds that it has handled the complainants request without undue delay considering the Christmas and New Year holidays and the individual error concerning the confirmation. Pursuant to Article 12(3) of the GDPR, Klarna informed the complainant of the maximum period allowed for carrying out a deletion. The reason for this was that the number of incoming cases was sometimes very high and the processing during these times could take more than a month. Klarna further states that it has further developed the processes concerning data subjects’ rights in order to ensure that the deadlines set are met and that the data subject is clearly informed. In addition, the responsible case officer in the case in question, as well as the other case officers, have received additional information on the importance of careful and expeditious handling of these cases. Justification of the decision Applicable provisions, etc. Article 12(3) of the GDPR requires the controller to provide the data subject, upon request, without undue delay and in any event no later than one month after receiving the request, with information on the actions taken pursuant to, inter alia, Article 17. The one-month time limit may be extended by a further two months where the request is particularly complex or the number of requests received is high. If the time limit of one month is extended, the controller shall inform the data subject of the extension. Notification of the extension of the deadline shall take place within one month of receipt of the request. The controller shall also indicate the reasons for the delay. European Data Protection Board (EDPB) Guidelines 01/2022 on access state that the time limit starts when the controller has received a request. However, when the controller needs to communicate with the data subject due to the uncertainty as to the identity of the person making the request, there may be a suspension in time until the controller has obtained the information needed from the data subject, provided the controller has asked for additional information without undue delay. 2 2EDPB Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access, Version 1.0, adopted for public consulta ion on 18 January 2022Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten Diarienummer: DI-2021-10488 3(4) Datum: 2022-03-18 Article 17(1)(a) provides that the data subject shall have the right to have his or her personal data erased without undue delay from the controller and the controller shall be obliged to erase personal data without undue delay if they are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed. Article 17(3) lists exhaustively the exceptions to this right. Assessment of the Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) The investigation shows that the complainant’s request for erasure was received by Klarna on 18 November 2020. Since Klarna had to communicate with the complainant in order to secure their identity and requested additional information without undue delay, IMY considers that the time limit to start again once the identity of the complainant has been verified on 25 November 2020. According to Klarna, the request has been fully met on 24 January 2021, which IMY does not find any reason to call into question. Klarna did not inform the complainant until 24 January 2021, i.e. approximately two months after the request was received and the identity of the complainant was verified, that the erasure process was initiated and that it can take up to 90 days for the erasure to be completed as well as stated the reasons for the delay. IMY therefore concludes that Klarna has not dealt with the complainant’s request without undue delay within the meaning of Article 12(3) of the GDPR. In light of the above, IMY concludes that Klarna has processed the complainant’s personal data in violation of Article 12(3) of the GDPR. Choice of corrective measure It follows from Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83(2) of the GDPR that the IMY has the power to impose administrative fines in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the circumstances of the case, administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or in place of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2), such as injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83(2) provides which factors are to be taken into account when deciding on administrative fines and in determining the amount of the fine. In the case of a minor infringement, as stated in recital 148, IMY may, instead of imposing a fine, issue a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b). Factors to consider is the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement and past relevant infringements. IMY notes the following relevant facts. The handling of the complainant’s request has been delayed mainly due to an individual procedural error. The violation is due to human error and has affected only one person. Against this background IMY considers that it is a minor infringement within the meaning of recital 148 and that Klarna Bank AB must be given a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR.

The DPA reprimands Google LLC under Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR for breach of Article 12(2). Postal address: Box 8114 104 20 Stockholm Website: www.imy.se E-mail: imy@imy.se Phone: 08-657 61 00 Summary of the decision The Privacy Authority (IMY) has examined Google's handling of the complainant's requests for Google's search engine not to display search results to the Lexbase directory service for searches related to the complainant's name (removal request), following a complaint from an individual. The open part of the directory service indicates whether a person appears in the database, which consists of documents from courts and public authorities, including criminal and civil judgments. Behind a paywall, access to these documents is offered to anyone. Google initially refused the requests, but in the course of the procedure has granted them. IMY has therefore not found any reason to investigate the complaint further in this respect. However, IMY has found grounds to investigate the complaint further as regards Google's justification in its message to the complainant as to why Google initially rejected the request. According to this reasoning, the request was rejected because Google did not have access to the content behind the payment gateway and was therefore unable to assess whether it was inaccurate or out of date. IMY states in the decision that the complainant has exercised his/her right to object to the processing under the GDPR by submitting his/her request. In such circumstances, it is the controller (Google) and not the data subject (the complainant) who bears the burden of proof to show that there are compelling legitimate grounds for refusing the request. Such a reason could be, for example, that there is a legitimate interest for the public to be able to access a particular publication through searches related to a particular person's name on a search engine such as Google's. However, such a public interest normally requires that the person requesting removal is a public figure or has a role in public life, which it had not been shown that the complainant was, either at the time of the refusal decision or subsequently. The fact that the directory service has a certificate of publication and that the documents behind the paywall are public does not, either individually or taken together, mean that the publication is in the public interest or can be considered to have been made for journalistic purposes. No other factor constituting decisive legitimate reasons has been brought to light. If, as in the present case, there are no compelling legitimate grounds for a request for removal based on an objection, the request shall be granted without any balancing exercise being required. Google's response in the case thus gave the erroneous impression that the complainant had to submit additional evidence to enable such a balancing exercise to be carried out. The only way for the complainant to access the evidence was to pay the owner of the directory service - in other words, the complainant was effectively forced to pay to exercise his right. Google has thus not facilitated the complainant's exercise of his rights and has processed his personal data in breach of Article 12(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation. As Google has complied with the request and taken several remedial measures, and as there were difficult trade-offs involved, IMY has considered it appropriate to refrain from imposing a penalty on Google for the breach found and to limit itself to issuing a reprimand under Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR.As mentioned above, IMY has also considered four other complaints with similar circumstances during the same period, with the same conclusions and outcome. Description of the supervision case The Privacy Authority (IMY) has initiated an enforcement action against Google LLC (Google) following a complaint that Google has denied two requests (Google ref no 5-4751000031502) for Google to not display three URLs in its search services for searches related to the complainant's name. The complaint The complaint essentially states. The complainant contacted Google on 14 November 2021 requesting that Google remove search results relating to an internet directory service (ref no 5- 4751000031502), which show the complainant's full name, age and postal address and that the complainant is listed in the directory service's database of court documents. The complainant argued that the request should be granted because the websites contain information on a criminal conviction. The complainant has served the sentence of 10 months' imprisonment. The sentence has no connection with the complainant's professional activity. The complainant is not a public person and has no role in public life, nor did he have one at the time of the offence. The complainant suffers great harm from the display. The complainant lost his job as a result of the conviction and has faced obstacles in both his professional and private relationships as a result of the publication. Furthermore, the pages show the complainant's full personal identity number, which is an extra-protected personal data whose processing without consent is specifically regulated by Swedish law in addition to the General Data Protection Regulation. As can be understood, the complainant has thus objected to the processing in accordance with Article 17(1)(c) of the GDPR. In its refusal decision of 16 November 2021, Google denied the complainant's request for removal on the grounds that ""Google does not have access to the content of the \[directory service\]. Therefore, based on the information available to us, we cannot conclude that the information is inaccurate or out of date. We have therefore decided not to take action in respect of this URL(s)'. On 22 November 2021, the complainant submitted the content of the URLs in the form of a screenshot of the website and a copy of the judgment. Subsequently, in a refusal decision dated 3 December 2021, Google denied the complainant's request, stating that ""Google has concluded that the information about you on these URLs - taking into account all the circumstances of the case known to us - is still relevant for data processing purposes. Therefore, the reference to this document in our search results is justified on grounds of public interest"". The complainant then objected again on 5 December 2021 to the processing under Article 21 of the GDPR and sent a reminder on 21 December. Nevertheless, in breach of Article 12 of the GDPR, Google has not responded within one month with a review of the request or information on the extension, thus preventing the complainant from asserting his rights as a data subject. Google has still not responded. In particular, the complaint points out that Google did not invoke any specific legal basis, did not inform in accordance with Article 21(4) of the GDPR about the right to object under Article 21(1) and did not inform that the data subject may obtain information on the assessment upon request as proposed in the Article 29 Working Party's Guidelines on Transparency (WP260 rev.01). What Google has stated Google has indicated in a statement to IMY on 28 March 2022 that, after further review, Google has granted the request and executed the removal on 16 March 2022. In its submission to IMY of 25 April 2022, Google has stated in essence the following. General When Google receives a request for deletion under the right to be forgotten, Google makes an assessment in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Justice and the guidelines of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), in the light of the requirements of Article 17(1)(c) and Article 21(1) of the GDPR. These requirements are part of the balancing test that Google carries out when dealing with right to be forgotten requests, where Google considers whether there are compelling legitimate reasons for the URLs to continue to be displayed in the event of a search on the data subject's name, and balances all relevant interests in accordance with the EDPB guidelines. In light of Articles 12(1), 12(2) and 12.4, Google also provides an FAQ on the process explaining how individuals make requests and how Google evaluates such requests, including examples of common scenarios where Google removes content (e.g. lack of public interest and content relating to minors) and where Google does not (e.g. strong public interest, where for example the information relates to the data subject's professional life or otherwise his/her role in public life). The handling in this case The URLs in this dossier link to content on the Lexbase website. Lexbase is a legal directory service containing public information from Swedish courts and authorities. It allows users to search for individuals and companies that have been the subject of criminal or civil claims in Swedish courts. Lexbase holds a certificate of publication. It is possible to search for individuals and company names, but the full information on convictions is available behind a paywall. As Google does not have access to the information behind the paywall, it is not possible for Google to assess the full content of the URL. It is therefore also not possible to verify whether the information provided by the complainant is correct. Google has therefore assumed that the material on Lexbase is an accurate copy of public records. One of the factors Google takes into account when determining whether information is in the public interest is where the information comes from. Government records play a crucial role in keeping society informed about matters of public interest, and the government's decision to publish and make it publicly available is a strong indication that it believes there is a public interest in the information. Lexbase gets its information from Swedish courts, i.e. from publicly available sources. The source is reliable and the information can, as a general rule, be assumed to be in the public interest when it is available in the public domain. Databases similar to Lexbase also exist in other jurisdictions, and what Google often sees is that registrants may be inclined to mischaracterize the content behind the paywall, provide incomplete or inaccurate information, or provide subjective descriptions of situations that speak in their favour. Cases are difficult to assess because Google can only make a judgement based on the information it receives in the case in question. It also involves assessing the credibility of different sources. The fact that some information comes from a public source, published by a government agency or a court, will naturally carry more weight when what is in the other scale is the subjective version of the complainant. Google notes that Google is a separate data controller from the website operator Lexbase. The distinction is why Google has an obligation to delete search results under data protection law, even when the website owner has not necessarily violated any law in publishing the material in question. Google is aware that Lexbase has been the subject of considerable public debate and that the incomplete display of an individual's presence in the database may be seen as problematic and have negative consequences for the individual. However, it remains the case that material on Lexbase is part of a public record and remains available from official sources. Therefore, in these very difficult borderline cases, when balancing all available facts, Google made the judgment that the URLs should not be deleted. Based on the above considerations, Google decided to reject the complainant's request on 16 November and 3 December 2021. The decision also clearly stated that the nature of the website was the reason why Google rejected the request. Google communicated the decision and the reasons for it to the complainant in accordance with Article 12(1) and 12(4) of the GDPR. This gave the complainant the opportunity to evaluate whether the decision taken by Google achieved the purpose of his request. The complainant had the possibility to submit a further request if he was not satisfied with the outcome. Google also informed the complainant that he could lodge a complaint with his local data protection authority. The fact that the complainant then provided screenshots from Lexbase did not change Google's decision. This in light of the above considerations regarding Lexbase as a whole. It was not possible for Google to verify that the screenshots submitted by the complainant constituted all the information behind the paywall on Lexbase. It was therefore also not possible for Google to make a full assessment of the credibility of the complainant's allegations. However, Google had knowledge that the material in question on Lexbase was in all likelihood an accurate copy of a public record. In view of the freedom of information in these complex cases, where the balance of interests is difficult, the decision to refuse deletion in the complainant's case appeared to be reasonable for Google. After receiving several requests for information from IMY, seeing requests from other registrants related to Lexbase, and reflecting more deeply on Lexbase cases, Google decided to evaluate the removal practices regarding Lexbase and other similar databases. Google carefully considered the questions raised by IMY and re�evaluated the decision in the present case. As mentioned above, Google decided to grant the complainant's request and remove the URL after receiving IMY's request for information. However, for the reasons set out above, Google continues to believe that the present case is a borderline case with respect to the final decision to delete the URL. In such borderline cases, further information or reflection may legitimately lead to a different conclusion, without necessarily an initial misjudgment. Google therefore does not consider that the earlier decision not to delete the URL was unreasonable or incorrect based on the information available at the time. Over time, however, Google has evaluated the approach to act with caution around deletions regarding Lexbase. Many less serious crimes are listed on Lexbase and it is reasonable to remove such URLs for individuals who have no role in public life. Google's practices are regularly updated and improved based on feedback from data subjects and data protection authorities. What this means in the future for Lexbase-related URL deletion requests is that Google will ask registrants for screenshots of the entire content behind the paywall. Google will then take this evidence into account when evaluating individual cases and, in line with EDPB guidelines, delete information where there is no public interest, for example for minor or long-standing crimes. Finally, as regards Google's compliance with Article 14(1)(c) and 14(2)(b) of the GDPR, Google relies on its legitimate interests in reproducing personal data made publicly available by websites that allow indexing by search engines, and third parties' legitimate interests in accessing these data, in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. Google informs users of this in the Google Privacy Policy: ""In certain circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly available sources. For example, if your name appears in the local newspaper, Google's search engine may index the article and display it to others if they search for your name."" (in the section entitled: ""Information Google collects"") ""We process your data for our legitimate interests and for the legitimate interests of third parties, while applying appropriate security measures to protect your privacy"" (in the section entitled: ""Compliance and cooperation with public authorities"") Users can click on ""third parties"" to see the following example of how Google may process personal data on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR: ""We may also process your data if someone searches for your name and we display search results for websites that contain publicly available information about you."" In reassessing this case, Google considers that it could have expressed its decision more clearly in its communications with the complainant. Google will review these communication practices. Google has also updated its internal instructions and communicated these to all staff handling removal requests. Google regularly trains its staff and these updates will be part of this training going forward. Grounds for the decision Applicable provisions etc. General Data Protection Regulation and complementary national legislation Article 12(2) of the GDPR requires the controller to facilitate the exercise of the data subject's rights in accordance with, inter alia, Articles 17 and 21. According to Article 17(1)(c) of the GDPR, a data subject has the right to have personal data relating to him or her erased if he or she objects to the processing under Article 21(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the controller's processing. According to Article 17(3)(a), this shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information. According to Article 21(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, including profiling based on these provisions. The controller may no longer process personal data unless it can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for doing so which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. Article 85 of the GDPR requires Member States to reconcile by law the right to privacy under the Regulation with freedom of expression and information, including processing for journalistic purposes. In Sweden, this has been done through Chapter 1 of the GDPR. The second paragraph of this provision provides, inter alia, for exemptions from the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation in the case of processing of personal data for journalistic purposes. Court of Justice of the European Union The European Court of Justice has ruled in GC and others that a search engine provider must, within the limits of its responsibility, competence and ability, ensure that the processing of personal data in the search engine business complies with the requirements of the data protection rules. The specific nature of the activity does not exempt it from the prohibitions and restrictions on the processing of sensitive and criminal data. However, these shall be applied within the scope of the responsibilities, powers and possibilities of the search engine provider as controller of the processing carried out in the course of its activities. The prohibitions and restrictions therefore apply to the reference to the web pages where the data appear as a result of the display of search results, in the context of the examination which the search engine provider must carry out at the request of the data subject. The CJEU has also clarified in GC and others how the right to erasure applies in relation to the GDPR and criminal data, stating that the interest of internet users in accessing a website containing such data through searches related to a data subject's name must be taken into account and that this right to freedom of information is protected by Article 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Court stated that while the rights of the data subject under Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter generally outweigh the interest of Internet users, the balance may be affected in particular cases by the nature of the information and its sensitivity to the privacy of the data subject and the public interest in the information,which may vary depending, inter alia, on the role played by the data subject in public life (paragraph 66). In addition, the processing of criminal data may constitute a particularly serious interference with the data subject's fundamental right to respect for private life and protection of personal data, given the sensitivity of such data (paragraph 67). It must therefore be examined, having regard to the circumstances and the seriousness of the interference, whether, in view of the important reasons of public interest which referred to in Article 9(2)(g) and subject to the conditions laid down therein, it is strictly necessary that search results linking to a website containing criminal data be displayed in searches relating to the name of the data subject in order to protect the freedom of information of Internet users who might be interested in accessing the website through such searches, a freedom enshrined in Article 11 of the Charter (paragraph 68). 4European Data Protection Board (EDPB) The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), in its guidelines on the application of the above-mentioned provisions of the GDPR and the rulings of the European Court of Justice on the removal of search hits, has stated, inter alia, that. 5 The right to object entails stronger safeguards for data subjects as it does not include any limitation of the grounds on which data subjects can request deletion under Article 17(1). The GDPR provides a presumption in favour of the data subject and it is for the controller to demonstrate ""compelling legitimate grounds for the processing"" (Article 21(1)). This means that a search engine provider that receives a deletion request based on the specific situation of the data subject must delete the personal data under Article 17(1)(c), unless it can demonstrate 'overriding legitimate grounds' for the display of the specific search result, which compared to Article 21(1) is 'overriding legitimate grounds \[...\] which outweigh the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject'. If the search engine provider can demonstrate 'overriding legitimate reasons', including exceptions under Article 17(3), the search engine provider may justify not removing a search hit. However, if the search engine provider cannot demonstrate overriding legitimate reasons, the data subject shall be entitled to deletion under Article 17(1)(c). Indeed, requests for removal involve a balancing of the reasons relating to the specific situation of the data subject and the decisive legitimate reasons of the search engine provider. In making such an assessment, it may be relevant to consider the balance between the protection of privacy and the interests of Internet users in accessing the information, as established by the Court of Justice of the European Union, as well as the balance struck by the European Court of Human Rights in cases concerning freedom of the press. The criteria for removal developed by the Article 29 Working Party in the Guidelines on the implementation of the judgment of the Court of Justice in Google Spain and Google,6 can therefore still be used to assess a request for removal based on the right to object (Article 17(1)(c)). In this respect, a request for deletion will be based on the specific situation of the data subject (e.g. whether a search result puts the data subject at a disadvantage when looking for a job, or harms the data subject's reputation or privacy) and this situation will be taken into account when balancing personal rights and the right to information, in addition to the classical criteria for dealing with deletion requests, such as • if he or she is not a public figure, • if the information in question is not related to the person's professional life but affects his or her private life, • if the information consists of hate speech, defamation, libel or similar offences against his or her freedom of expression as determined by a court of law • if the information appears to be verified facts but is factually inaccurate, and • if the data relate to a relatively minor offence committed a long time ago and are harmful to the data subject. However, no assessment of these criteria is required in the absence of evidence of compelling legitimate reasons for refusing the request. One circumstance that may militate against removal is if the person concerned plays a role in public life or is a public figure. A role in public life normally refers, for example, to politicians, senior public officials, business people and practitioners of regulated professions (e.g. lawyers and doctors). It can be argued that the public should be able to search for information relevant to their public roles and activities. The rule of thumb is whether having access to the specific information - through a search on the name of the data subject - would protect the public from improper public or professional conduct. A public figure is someone who, by virtue of their duties or obligations, has a certain degree of media exposure. It may be someone who holds public office, uses public resources or plays a role in public life in politics, economics, the arts, the social sphere, sport or any other field. There may be information about public figures that is purely private and should not appear in search results, such as information about their health or family members. However, as a rule of thumb, if the person concerned is a public figure, and the information in question is not purely private, this militates against deletion. In determining the balance, the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) is particularly relevant. As the European Court of Justice explains in its judgment in G.C. and others, C�136/17, Article 17(3)(a) of the GDPR 'expresses that the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right, but \[...\] must be understood in relation to its function in society and balanced against other fundamental rights in accordance with the principle of proportionality'. It therefore 'explicitly requires a balancing of the fundamental rights to respect for private life and protection of personal data, as enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, with the fundamental right to freedom of information guaranteed by Article 11 of the \[EU Charter of Fundamental Rights\]'. The CJEU further states that ""where a search engine provider receives a request for removal relating to a link to a web page containing \[sensitive personal data or data relating to infringements\] \[...\], it must examine, on the basis of all the relevant circumstances of the case and having regard to the seriousness of the interference with the data subject's fundamental right to respect for private life and protection of personal data, as laid down in Articles 7 and 8 of the \[EU Charter of Fundamental Rights\], whether, having regard to the important \[reasons\] in the public interest \[....\] it is strictly necessary to include the link to the website in question among the search results displayed following a search for the name of the data subject in order to protect the freedom of information of internet users who may be interested in accessing that website through such a search, a freedom enshrined in Article 11 of the Charter"". In conclusion, depending on the circumstances of the case, search engine providers may refuse a removal request if they can show that it is strictly necessary to include the search hit in the search results in order to protect the freedom of information of internet users. The Article 29 Working Party has stated that in assessing whether a search hit should be removed, depending on the context, it may be relevant to consider whether the information on a website was published for journalistic purposes and that the fact that the information was published by a journalist whose profession is to inform the public is a factor to be taken into account in the balancing exercise. 8 With regard to the meaning of the concept, the EDPB has noted that the Court of Justice of the European Union, when examining the right to removal from search engines, distinguishes between the legitimacy that the publisher of a website may have in disseminating information and the legitimacy of the search engine provider. In doing so, the CJEU has recognised that a publisher's activities may be exclusively for journalistic purposes, in which case the publisher would benefit from the exemptions that Member States may establish in such situations on the basis of Article 9 of the Directive (now Article 85(2) of the GDPR). In this respect, the CJEU's judgment of 28 June 2018 in M.L. and W.W. v. Germany suggests that the balancing of interests in question may lead to different results depending on the type of request (distinguishing between, on the one hand, a request for erasure directed against the original publisher - whose activities are central to the protection of freedom of expression - and, on the other hand, a request for deletion directed against a search engine provider - whose main interest is not to publish the original information about the data subject, but to enable the identification of any available information about the person and thus to establish the person's profile). 9 European Court of Human Rights The case-law of the European Court of Human Rights shows that when data subjects request a ban on the publication on the internet of old media reports on criminal proceedings against them, a fair balance must be struck between the right to privacy of the persons concerned and, inter alia, the public's right to freedom of information. In seeking this fair balance, account should be taken of the important role of the press in a democratic society, which includes reporting on and commenting on court proceedings. In addition to the role of the media in conveying such information and opinions, there is also the right of the public to receive the information. In this context, the European Court of Human Rights has recognised that the public has an interest not only in being informed about a current event, but also in being able to investigate past events. However, the scope of the public interest in criminal proceedings may vary and evolve over time, taking into account, inter alia, the circumstances of the case. Privacy Authority IMY has provided guidance in a legal opinion11 on the various factors that are relevant to the balancing of interests when a data subject requests the removal of a search hit, in particular when the linked page relates to a publication in a news medium. Among it is also considered that if a search result leads to a publication that falls under both the responsible publisher system of the freedom of expression principles and the media ethics system, it should, as a starting point, be given independent weight in the balancing of interests as a factor against removal, although the balancing of interests should be made on the basis of an overall assessment of all the relevant circumstances of the case. 12 It follows, therefore, that if an activity is covered only by the system of responsible publishers under the freedom of expression foundations, this cannot in itself be given independent weight, since this system does not, on its own, have the same protective effects for individuals as the media ethics system, and may also cover activities which have no journalistic purpose (since this is not a precondition for the granting of voluntary constitutional protection through the so�called 'certificate of publication'). Such a factor must therefore be assessed on a case�by-case basis. IMY has stated in a legal opinion on the concept of ""journalistic purposes ""13 that the concept should be given a broad interpretation. It emphasises that journalistic activities are those aimed at disseminating information, opinions or ideas to the public, regardless of the medium through which this is done. The concept thus has a broader meaning than in everyday language and covers not only professional journalists and traditional mass media, but all persons engaged in activities aimed at disseminating information, opinions or ideas to the public. However, IMY stresses that the concept cannot be given such a broad meaning as to include all information made available on the internet and containing personal data. In this context, IMY points out that, according to the European Court of Justice, the concept does not cover the processing carried out by a search engine provider through the provision of the search engine and that in the Swedish constitutional legislative work it has been established that the same should apply to a purely public search service relating to criminal convictions. 14 Furthermore, the statement clarifies how Chapter 1. 7 of the Data Protection Act is to be applied when there are other parallel purposes to the journalistic purpose and what significance it has that the term ""exclusively"" is not included in Chapter 1. 7(2) of the Data Protection Act and Article 85 of the GDPR. Among other things, IMY considers that, based on the wording of the relevant provisions, there is no requirement that processing be carried out exclusively for journalistic purposes for the exemption to apply. 15 However, IMY considers that it should be required that the journalistic purpose is the main purpose of the processing for the exemption to apply. 16 Privacy Authority's assessment Has Google handled the complainant's requests correctly? IMY is required by Article 57(1)(f) of the GDPR to deal with complaints about the incorrect processing of personal data and, where appropriate, to investigate the subject matter of the complaint. 12(14) It appears from the information in the case that Google has taken steps to respect the complainant's rights by removing the relevant search hit from searches related to the complainant's name. In the light of the above, IMY does not consider it necessary to investigate the complaint further in this respect. However, IMY finds grounds to investigate the complaint insofar as it concerns the wording used by Google in the refusal decision of 16 November 2021 of the complainant's removal request concerning the Lexbase directory service, i.e. that Google did not have access to the material behind the paywall. The investigation shows that the open part of the directory service shows the complainant's full name, age and location and that the complainant is ""present"" in the database. It also states that ""\[the directory service\] is a web service offering public information from Swedish courts and other authorities. Here you can find judgments in criminal and/or civil cases concerning individuals"". Google justified its rejection decision on the grounds that 'Google does not have access to the content of the \[directory service\]' and '\[u\]nder the data available to \[Google\] ... cannot conclude that the information is inaccurate or out of date'. However, IMY notes that the complainant, through his request, objected to the processing on the basis of Article 17(1)(c) and Article 21 of the GDPR with reference to his specific situation. Under Article 21(1), in such circumstances, the burden of proof is on the controller (i.e. Google) and not on the data subject (i.e. the complainant) to show that there are compelling legitimate grounds for refusing the request.17 Such a ground could be, for example, that there is a legitimate public interest in being able to access a particular publication through searches related to a particular person's name on a search engine such as Google's. However, such a public interest normally requires that the person requesting removal is a public figure or has a role in public life, which it had not been shown that the complainant was, either at the time of the refusal decision or subsequently. The fact that the directory service has a certificate of publication and that the documents behind the paywall are public does not, either individually or taken together, mean that the publication is in the public interest or can be regarded as having been made for journalistic purposes. 18 Thus, in the absence of conclusive justification for refusing the request, Google should, as a general rule, have granted it on the basis of the evidence available at that time, which it did not do. Furthermore, the reasoning given by Google to the complainant in the decision - that Google did not have access to the content behind the paywall of the directory service - gave the erroneous impression that the complainant had to submit such evidence in order to have its request granted. Since the content is behind a paywall, anyone wishing to access it has to pay the owner of the directory service (currently €98). The consequence of Google's action was thus that the data subject (the complainant) had to pay a third party (Lexbase) in practice in order to exercise his rights (right of deletion) with the controller (Google). Google has thus not facilitated the exercise of the complainant's rights under the GDPR and has thus processed the complainant's personal data in breach of Article 12(2). Choice of intervention Articles 58(2)(i) and 83(2) of the GDPR provide that IMY has the power to impose administrative fines in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the circumstances of the case, administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or instead of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2), such as injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83(2) sets out the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether to impose administrative fines and when determining the amount of the fine. In the case of a minor infringement, IMY may, as indicated in recital 148, instead of imposing a penalty, issue a reprimand under Article 58(2)(b). Account will be taken of aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement and any relevant previous infringements. IMY notes the following relevant facts. The breach has affected an individual and involved difficult trade-offs between competing fundamental rights and freedoms. During the procedure, Google has respected the complainant's rights and has taken several remedial measures and improved its information to data subjects. IMY concludes that, on the basis of an overall assessment of the circumstances, in particular taking into account the difficult balancing of competing fundamental rights and freedoms, there are grounds to refrain from imposing a fine on Google for the infringement found. In view of the above, IMY also considers that this is a minor breach within the meaning of recital 148, which requires Google LLC to be reprimanded under Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR for the breach found. This decision has been taken by the special decision-maker Olle Pettersson, lawyer, on the recommendation of Martin Wetzler, lawyer.

Section 2 of the Data Protection Act and Articles 58.2 and 83 i the data protection regulation that the board must pay an administrative sanction fee of 200,000 (two hundred thousand) kroner. Account of the supervisory matter IMY has initiated supervision of the committee due to information that emerged in one complaint from a person who, on 6 May 2021, received an invitation via letter to a healthcare visit within Region Dalarna. The complaint states that the summons was in a window envelope and that information that it was a summons, the complainant's name and address and the care facility ning the summons was fully visible in the window of the envelope. The purpose of IMY's supervision is to investigate the board's processing of personal data in connection with the use of the current type of window envelope for invitations to health care visits meets the requirements for security in connection with the processing according to article 32 of the data protection regulation. Within the framework of the supervisory matter, IMY has only reviewed the committee's mailing of summonses regarding the Child and Adolescent Medical Clinic Mora, Call Center children and young people Falun and the Sleep Laboratory in Avesta. The board has essentially stated the following. The committee is a healthcare provider and personal Postal address: responsible for the personal data processing that the supervision refers to. Summons from Box 8114 Region Dalarna is sent using Postnord Strålfors AB's (Strålfors) function 104 20 Stockholm e-LETTER. The notices are sent securely in digital format from Region Dalarna's journal system Website: to Strålfors, which mechanically prints, envelopes and sends the invitation to the addressee. www.imy.se Email: 1 imy@imy.se Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with Telephone: Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). the free flow of such data and on the cancellation of 2 The Act (2018:218) with supplementary provisions to the EU's data protection regulation. 08-657 61 00 The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-695 2(8) Date: 2023-01-17 The board identified the risk of using double windows when the service was procured and therefore bought an additional service which means that envelopes which only contains a window with the recipient's address to be used. On these envelopes is written Region Dalarna's postal address printed where the sender's address is usually placed and the name of the clinic/department that sent the summons is therefore not shown. The board's opinion is that the sending clinic should not appear on the envelope. In a statement to IMY dated 28 April 2022, the board stated that it had started a investigation together with Strålfors. In an opinion dated 16 June 2022, the board stated i mainly the following. It is unclear when the committee started sending summons where the patient's name and the care facility to which the summons refers appear on the window of the envelope. The investigation shows that the additional service where the sender is hidden only applies to sending of a maximum of five A4 sheets. If the mailing contains more A4 sheets, a larger envelope is required be used and then there are no customer-unique envelopes in the assignment that has been signed eBREV, standard envelopes with two windows are used instead. In the same opinion stated the committee that the investigative work to review the flow regarding the sending of summonses via eBREV and risks linked to these that could generate a personal data- incident in progress. In parallel with this, a discussion is being held with Strålfors about the need to renegotiate the customer assignment to ensure that the correct type of envelope, with hidden sender, used for all mailings. In an opinion dated June 16, 2022, the board stated that the treatment that is subject to supervision had not ceased. In a supplement that the board submitted to IMY on July 6, 2022, it was stated that the board, until an agreement is reached with Strålfors, will change the template for invitations to visit the three units (Children's and youth medicine clinic Mora, Children's and youth consultation clinic young Falun and the Sleep Laboratory in Avesta) that have been identified send invitations with attachments exceeding five A4 sheets. The board has attached a picture that shows that the invitations will be sent in an envelope with two windows, where Region Dalarnas postal address appears in one window and information that it is a visit via video link and the patient's name and address in the second. In an opinion dated August 9, 2022, the board stated that previous answers have been deleted from invitations sent through the Take Care IT system. It is about 2,500 summons per year, which corresponds to 0.5 percent of the total number of summons sent through the current system. Justification of the decision Applicable regulations Scope of the Data Protection Regulation Article 2.1 of the data protection regulation states that the regulation must be applied to such processing of personal data that is fully or partially carried out automatically as well as on other than automatic processing of personal data that is part of or will be to be included in a register. In doctrinanges that because the data protection regulation includes partially automated processing of personal data, the regulation is applicable in the case of disclosure on paper of personal data that is in data format. Furthermore, the Chancellor of Justice has assessed that 3 See Öhman, Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) etc. (October 13, 2022, Version 2A, JUNO), Comment to Article 2.1 subheading Automated processing. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-695 3(8) Date: 2023-01-17 the expression ""fully or partially automated processing of personal data"" in the present the repealed Personal Data Act (1998:204) covered the sending of documents by post when the underlying processing of the personal data was automated. 4 Personal data is defined in Article 4.1 of the Data Protection Regulation as any information which refers to an identified or identifiable natural person. Processing is defined in Article 4.2 of the Data Protection Regulation as an action or combination of measures concerning personal data or sets of personal data, regardless of whether it is performed automatically or not, such as collection, registration, organization, structuring, storage, processing or modification, production, reading, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise providing, adjusting or combining, limiting, erasing or destruction. Personal data responsibility and the principle of accountability According to Article 4.7 of the data protection regulation, the person in charge of personal data means a natural or legal person, public authority, institution or other body which alone or together with others determines the purposes and means of treatment ling of personal data. If the purposes and means of the processing are determined by Union law or the national law of the Member States can the personal data controller or the special criteria for how he is to be appointed are prescribed in Union law or in national law of the Member States. According to ch. 2 Section 6 of the Patient Data Act (2008:355), PDL, is a care provider personal data- responsible for the processing of personal data carried out by the care provider. In a region or a municipality is any authority that provides health care personal data- responsible for the processing of personal data carried out by the authority. According to Article 5.2 of the Data Protection Regulation, the person in charge of personal data shall be responsible for and be able to demonstrate that the principles in Article 5.1 are complied with (the principle of liability). The personal data controller is responsible for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing is carried out in in accordance with the data protection regulation. The measures must be implemented taking into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing and the risks, of varying degrees of probability and seriousness, for the freedoms and rights of natural persons. The measures must be reviewed and updated if necessary. It appears from Article 24.1 i data protection regulation. Data on health Information about health is defined in Article 4.15 of the Data Protection Regulation as personal data relating to a natural person's physical or mental health, including provision of healthcare services, which provide information about his health status. Information about health constitutes so-called sensitive personal data. It is prohibited to process such personal data according to Article 9.1 of the Data Protection Ordinance ning, unless the processing is covered by one of the exceptions in Article 9.2 i the regulation. 4See JK decision 2020-05-18, dnr 3850-19-4.3.2. Data Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-695 4(8) Date: 2023-01-17 Recital 35 of the data protection regulation states the following. Personal information about health should include all the information relating to a registered person's state of health which provides information about the data subject's past, present or future physical or mental health conditions. This includes information about the natural person who collected in connection with registration for or provision of health and healthcare services to the natural person according to the European Parliament and the Council directive 2011/24/EU, a number, a symbol or a characteristic such as the physical the person assigned to identify him for health care purposes, data arising from tests or examination of a body part or body substance, including genetic information and biological samples, and other information about, for example disease, disability, risk of disease, medical history, clinical treatment or the recorded physiological or biomedical conditions, regardless of the source, for example show from a doctor or other healthcare professional, a hospital, a medical technician product or an in vitro diagnostic test. In the case Lindqvist (C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, point 51), the Court of Justice of the EU has determined that information that a person has injured their foot and is on part-time sick leave constitutes a person- data relating to health according to the data protection directive (the directive was repealed by data protection regulation). The European Court of Justice stated in the case that with regard to the purpose of the data protection directive, the expression ""data relating to health"" should be given a broad interpretation and considered to include data relating to all aspects of a person's health, both physical and psychological ones (see point 50). The European Court of Justice has further in a later ruling Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisiya (C-184/20, EU:C:2022:601) stated that the concept of sensitive personal data according to article 9.1 of the data protection regulation shall interpreted broadly and judged that even personal data that indirectly reveals a physical a person's sexual orientation constitutes sensitive personal data according to the person in question the provision. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has stated that the concept of health data according to the data protection regulation must be interpreted broadly against the background of, among other things, EU the court's judgment in the Lindqvist case and as it appears from reason 53 of the data protection the regulation that information about health deserves extensive protection. IMY has in one legal position deemed that information about guardianship according to the parental code are information about health (IMYRS 2022:3). The requirement for security when processing personal data It follows from Article 32.1 of the data protection regulation that the personal data controller and the personal data assistant must take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of safety that is appropriate in relation to the risk of the treatment. It must take into account the latest developments, implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing as well as the risks, of varying degree of probability and seriousness, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. When assessing the appropriate security level, special consideration must be given to the risks that the processing entails, in particular from accidental or illegal destruction, loss or alteration or unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to personal data which transferred, stored or otherwise processed. It appears from Article 32.2 i data protection regulation. 5Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regarding the processing of personal data and the free flow of such data. 6See the EDPB's guidelines 03/2020 on the processing of data on health for scientific research purposes in connection with the covid-19 outbreak, p. 5. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-695 5(8) Date: 2023-01-17 Recital 75 of the data protection regulation states factors that must be taken into account in the assessment of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Loss of, among other things, is mentioned confidentiality with regard to personal data subject to confidentiality and whether the processing concerns information about health or sexual life. Further must be taken into account the processing concerns personal data about vulnerable natural persons, especially children, or if the processing involves a large number of personal data and applies to a large number of registrants. In recital 76 of the data protection regulation, it is stated that how likely and serious the risk is to it data subject's rights and freedoms should be determined based on the nature of the processing, scope, context and purpose. The risk should be evaluated on the basis of a objective assessment, through which it is determined whether the data processing includes a risk or high risk. If the personal data controller hires a personal data assistant to carry out a processing, the personal data controller shall only employ personal data assistants who provides sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures. It must take place in such a way that the processing meets the requirements of data protection regulation and that the data subject's rights are protected. It appears from article 28.1 and recital 81 of the data protection regulation. The Swedish Privacy Protection Authority's assessment The investigation into the matter shows that the board during the period from 6 May 2021 to and including on 6 July 2022 has used a service for sending physical letters which meant that some invitations to health care visits have been sent out in window envelopes with information that it is a summons, the patient's name and address and the care facility to which the visit relates were fully visible. The Data Protection Regulation is applicable The information in the summons that was visible through the window envelopes refers to identified persons. It is therefore a matter of personal data. The board's processing of the personal data consists of a series of measures where the board's disclosure of personal data by physical mail has been a part. The underlying part of the process, which, among other things, means that invitations are sent in digital format from Region Dalarna's journal system is automated. IMY therefore assesses that it is a question about a partially automated processing of personal data covered by scope of application of the data protection regulation. Personal data responsibility The board has stated that it is the healthcare provider responsible for personal data for that treatment of personal data in the event of invitations to healthcare visits within the Dalarna Region that are subject to supervision, which is supported by the other investigation in the case. IMY therefore assesses that the committee is responsible for personal data for the current processing. The treatment involved a high risk As a personal data controller, the board must, according to Article 32.1 of the Data Protection Ordinance, ning, take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a appropriate level of security in relation to the risks involved in processing personal data. The also applies when personal data is processed by a personal data processor. IMY does the following assessment of the risks of the treatment in question. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-695 6(8) Date: 2023-01-17 According to information from the board, summonses that have shown sender reception have been sent from the Child and Adolescent Medicine Clinic Mora, Children's Call Center and young Falun and the Sleep Laboratory in Avesta. The investigation into the matter shows that the receptions offer care for children and young people aged 0–17 with illnesses and illness that requires more specialist knowledge and resources than is normally available care centre, help for children and young people up to 17 years of age with mild to moderate mental illness respective investigation and treatment of various sleep disorders. IMY states that the concept of health must be interpreted broadly and assesses that the care which given at the care facilities in question is so specific that an invitation to visit someone of these receptions may be considered to provide information about the individual's physical or mental health conditions. Against this background, IMY assesses that the information regarding these care facilities, which were fully visible at the time of dispatch, constitute information about health in the sense referred to in Article 4.15 of the Data Protection Regulation. The data are therefore so-called sensitive personal data covered by the protection according to Article 9.1 of the regulation. The data is also protected within the health and medical care by confidentiality according to 25 ch. Section 1 of the Publicity and Confidentiality Act (2009:400). Because two of the concerned the care facilities only provide care for people who are 17 years of age or younger furthermore, it is established that in some cases the information has also referred to children, who are considered special protected according to the data protection regulation. It is also a comprehensive one treatment that includes approximately 2,500 mailings from several different care facilities. Against this background, IMY assesses that it is a treatment that involved a high risk and that strong protection was therefore required. The board has not taken sufficient security measures IMY states that the mailings with invitations to visits at Children's and Youth Medicine's should the reception Mora, the Children and Young People's Call Reception Falun and The sleep laboratory in Avesta took place in such a way that the sensitive personal data have been fully visible to everyone who came into contact with the letters. The data has been available to, for example, those who work with handling mail, those who share household with the recipient and the person who received a letter that was delivered to the wrong address. In order to achieve an appropriate level of security, the dispatches should, according to IMY's assessment, have took place in such a way that the sensitive personal data was not visible. The committee has thus not been able to ensure the level of security required according to Article 32.1 in the data protection regulation. It can be stated that the board's opinion is indeed that it should not be apparent from the envelope which reception a summons to a care visit refers to and that the board therefore procured a service for the purpose of concealing sending reception. After IMY started supervision however, the committee carried out an investigation which showed that the service in question only included invitations on a maximum of five A4 sheets and that other invitations were sent in envelopes which showed which clinic the visit was intended for. IMY states that it has arrived at the committee as personal data controller to ensure that before the processing in question, it the current add-on service fulfilled the need to keep the data hidden from others yet the recipient of the letter. 7 See recital 38 of the data protection regulation. Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-695 7(8) Date: 2023-01-17 Against this background, IMY assesses that the committee has not taken sufficient measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk involved current treatment. The board has therefore processed personal data in violation of article 32.1 of the data protection regulation. Choice of intervention Applicable regulations In the event of violations of the data protection regulation, IMY has a number of corrective powers called to be available according to Article 58.2 a–j of the data protection regulation, including reprimand, injunction and penalty fees. Article 83.2 of the data protection regulation states that IMY must impose administrative penalty fees in addition to or instead of the other measures referred to in Article 58.2 depending on the circumstances of the individual case. Member States may determine rules for whether and to what extent administrative penalty charges can be imposed public authorities. This is apparent from article 83.7 of the data protection regulation. According to 6 ch. Section 2 of the Data Protection Act allows IMY to collect penalty fees from authorities at violations referred to in article 83.4, 83.5 and 83.6 of the data protection regulation and that Article 83.1, 83.2 and 83.3 of the regulation shall then be applied. In article 83.2 of the data protection regulation, the factors that must be taken into account when making a decision are stated if administrative penalty fees are to be imposed and when determining the fee size. If it is a question of a minor violation, IMY receives according to reason 148 more data protection regulation to issue a reprimand instead of imposing a penalty fee. The factors specified in Article 83.2 of the Data Protection Regulation must also be taken into account the determination of the amount of the penalty fee. Each supervisory authority must ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty charges is effective in each individual case, proportionate and dissuasive. This is apparent from Article 83.1 of the Data Protection Ordinance. A penalty fee must be imposed IMY has concluded that the board has processed personal data in violation of Article 32.1 of the data protection regulation. IMY finds in an overall assessment of the circumstances described under the heading Amount of the penalty fee that there is reason to impose a penalty fee on the board and that it is therefore not a question of one such a minor violation that there is reason to issue a reprimand instead. The size of the penalty fee For violations of, among other things, Article 32 of the Data Protection Ordinance may the sanction fee for public authorities amounts to a maximum of SEK 5,000,000. The appears from ch. 6. Section 2 of the Data Protection Act and Article 83.4 of the Data Protection Ordinance. In the assessment of the seriousness of the violation, IMY considers in accordance with Article 83.2 g in the data protection regulation that the processing has included sensitive personal data about health and information about children, which are particularly worthy of protection according to data protection the regulation. Furthermore, IMY takes into account what has emerged about the nature and severity of the violation and duration based on what is stated in article 83.2 a of the data protection regulation. Thereby it can be established that the violation has been going on for a longer period of just over a year, from and with May 6, 2021, when the patient who filed the underlying complaint for the supervisory authority received its summons, up to and including July 6, 2022, when the board took Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten Diary number: IMY-2022-695 8(8) Date: 2023-01-17 measures to hide the sender's receipt on the envelope when mailing. Against background of the fact that the board stated that it is about 2,500 summonses per year can also it is established that the violation affects a large number of registered users. Furthermore, it means the fact that the violation has occurred in healthcare - i.e. a business there the registered patient is in a dependent and vulnerable position i relationship with the person in charge of personal data - that there is reason to look more seriously the violation. However, IMY assesses that there are also factors that speak to the contrary direction in the assessment of the seriousness of the infringement. First, it moves if a physical handling and not a digital one which would have involved a risk of greater and faster dissemination of the data. A distribution by regular mail is more limited and controlled than a transfer via the open network. Furthermore, have emerged that the committee identified the risk of exposing those in question the personal data during mailings and therefore took certain measures in order to comply the requirements and reduce the risks of the treatment. IMY decides based on an overall assessment of the circumstances of the case that The health care board in Region Dalarna must pay an administrative fee penalty fee of SEK 200,000. This decision has been taken by the general manager Lena Lindgren Schelin after a presentation by the lawyer Maja Welander. In the final processing of the case has also head of law David Törngren, acting head of unit Linn Sandmark and IT- and information security specialist Magnus Bergström participated.

In view of the complaint www.imy.se E-mail: relating to cross-border processing, IMY has made use of the cooperation and imy@imy.se 1 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the Phone: protection of natural persons with regard to he processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, 08-657 61 00 and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: IMY-2022-1032 2(8) Date:2022-12-12 consistency mechanisms provided for in Chapter VII of the GDPR. The supervisory authorities concerned have been the data protection authorities in Denmark, Norway and Finland. The complaints The complainants have mainly stated the following. Complaint 1 (Complaint from Finland with national registration number 1576/153/2020) The complainant was in contact with the company on 20 February 2020 and requested erasure. The company replied to the complainant that the complainant needs to send them the postal address so that they can send the complainant documents relating to the complainant’s request. These documents were to be signed and returned by the complainant. In addition, the company requested the complainant to verify the identity by sending a copy of the complainant´s identity document by e-mail. For security reasons, the complainant was not willing to provide what was requested. Complaint 2 (Complaint from Denmark with national registration number 2020-31- 3616) The complainant requested erasure of the complainant´s information on lensway.dk. In order to comply with the request, the company requested that the complainant provide the social security number and a copy of the identity document. However, the company could not tell the complainant why they need that information except that they need it in order to confirm the complainant´s identity. The complainant questions the need for the company to collect personal data in order to erase personal data. The complainant suggested that the company could instead confirm the complainant´s identity by sending an e-mail to the address registered on the complainant but they refused. What Lensway Group AB has stated In its statements of 20 April, 12 May and 11 August 2022, the company has mainly stated the following. The Company is the data controller concerning the processing to which the complaints relates. Complaint 1 The company has received the complaint’s request for erasure, but the complainant has not completed the company´s at the time current verification process. The company has requested the complainant to submit a copy of the identity document. This is the only way the company has so far been able to ensure the identity of the customer. The copy was to be sent by regular mail. The company also requested the complainant to submit a signed request for erasure. The company has so far not been able to receive this information digitally. In order to ensure that they have received original documents, they have asked the complainant to submit it via regular mail. Complaint 2 The company received the request for erasure on 25 June 2020 but the complainant did not complete the company’s at the time current verification process. It is true that the company requested the complainant’s social security number in the written form, but it has been voluntary to provide this information. In addition to the information requested in the written form, the company requested the complainant to submit aPrivacy Protection Authority Our ref: IMY-2022-1032 3(8) Date:2022-12-12 copy of the identity document. The company has so far not been able to identify the complainant in any other way. The complainant was asked to submit the information by regular mail in order to ensure that the company had received the original documents. As regards both complaints the company has stated the following: As regards the written form to be submitted by both complainants, the company states the following concerning the personal data required to disclose and why the information was necessary. • Name is mandatory information which is requested to confirm the identity of the data subject. • Email address is mandatory information which is requested because it is used as a unique identifier of customers in the company’s system. • Signature is mandatory for the company to be able to ensure that the data subject has read the information and has given his or her consent. The company states that they should always ensure that it is the right person that contacts them when it comes to requests to exercise a right under the GDPR. Since the company was previously unable to identify the customer in a good and secure way when they contacted the company through customer service, the manual process via regular mail has been the one they have used. In this way, they have had a two-step verification. Functionality to enable confirmation of the customer’s identity through customer service has not been in place. The customer relationship with the company can be established in two ways, either the customer makes a purchase or the customer logs in to My Pages. When the customer creates an account on My Pages, the customer enters their email address and an email with confirmation is sent to the customer. The customer can then, via the link in the email, come to a web page where they link a password to the email address. The customer account is then created and the company thus receives a two-step verification. The complainants used the second method by which the customer relationship can be established. The complainants made purchases with the company and they were identified through the company’s payment service provided by Klarna. For most payment options, Klarna requires the customer to verify themselves via bank ID. For certain payment methods, for example payment by credit card, the customer may choose not to have to verify via bank ID through Klarna’s app. The company’s existing digital contact channel is My Pages. However, there has been no functionality to handle requests to exercise a right under the GDPR on My Pages. Since April 2022, the company’s customers can now request to be erasured or receive a copy of their personal data directly via My Pages. The customer’s identity is then verified via regular login.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: IMY-2022-1032 4(8) Date:2022-12-12 Statement of reasons for the decision Applicable provisions, etc. According to Article 17(1), the data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the grounds set out in the Article applies, for example when the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or if the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based. Article 12(2) requires the controller to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Articles 15 to 22. Article 12(6) states that, without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject . The European Data Protection Board’s (EDPB) Guidelines 01/2022 on access state 2 inter alia: 65. In cases where the controller requests the commission of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject, the controller shall each time assess what information will allow it to confirm the data subject’s identity and possibly ask additional questions to the requesting person or request the data subject to present some additional identification elements, if it is proportionate (see section 3.3). Such additional information should not be more than the information initially needed for the verification of the data subject’s identity (authentication). In general, the fact that the controller may request additional information to assess the data subject’s identity cannot lead to excessive demands and to the collection of personal data which is not relevant or necessary to strengthen the link between the individual and the personal data requested. \[...\] 73. It should be emphasised that using a copy of an identity document as a part of the authentication process creates a risk for the security of personal data and may lead to unauthorised or unlawful processing, and as such it should be considered inappropriate, unless it is strictly necessary, suitable, and in line with national law. In such cases the controllers should have systems in place that ensure a level of security appropriate to mitigate the higher risks for the rights and freedoms of the data subject to receive such data. It is also important to note that identification by means of an identity card does not necessarily help in the online context (e.g. with the use of pseudonyms) if the person concerned cannot contribute any other evidence, e.g. further characteristics matching to the user account. 2EDPB, Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights — Right of access, Version 1.0. The guidelines have been out for public consultation and are awaiting final adoption.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: IMY-2022-1032 5(8) Date:2022-12-12 Assessment of IMY On the basis of the complaints in question, IMY has examined the company’s conduct in these two individual cases. Has the company acted in accordance with 12(6) of the General Data Protection Regulation when the company requested current information from the complainants? Has Lensway Group had reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of the complainants? It is only when the controller has reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of the person making the request that additional information to confirm the identity may be requested. What constitutes “reasonable grounds” in Article 12(6) GDPR should be assessed on the basis of the circumstances in the individual case. The assessment of whether there are reasonable grounds in an individual case to doubt the identity of the one requesting is normally made in the light of the information provided in connection with the request. This applies particularly in situations where the controller has no further knowledge of the person. However, the need for an individual assessment does not preclude the establishment of routines for how the controller normally verifies the identity of the data subject. The company was given the opportunity to motivate the individual assessment made based on the complainants’ situation if they considered that they had reasonable doubts as to the identity of the complainants when the complainants submitted their requests. With regard to both complainants, the company argues mainly as follows. The company should always ensure that it is the right person that contact them when it comes to requests to exercise a right under the GDPR. The customer has not previously been able to be identified in a good and secure manner when they contacted the company through Customer Service. Functionality for handling requests to exercise a right under the GDPR has not been available through Customer Service or on My Pages. IMY notes that it is not clear from the investigation in the case what information the complainants provided in connection with their request and whether there were reasons for the company to doubt their identity on the basis of those requests. However, IMY considers that, in light of what has emerged in the case, there is no need to question the company´s statement that it had reason to doubt the identity of the complainants. In the assessment, IMY takes into consideration the fact that the obligation to ensure the identity of the one requesting also is intended to protect data subjects against someone else making requests in their name, which may lead to negative consequences for the data subject. The risks of these negative consequences in the event of false requests are particularly obvious in the case of more invasive measures, such as the exercise of the right to erasure. IMY therefore takes the view that it has not been shown other than that the company, in the present cases, have had reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of the complainants. Has the information requested by the Lensway Group been necessary to confirm the identity of the complainants?Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: IMY-2022-1032 6(8) Date:2022-12-12 Although the controller has reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of the data subjects, the controller shall not collect more personal data than is necessary to enable the confirmation of the identity of the requesting data subject. The company mainly states the following concerning the necessity of the information they have requested from both complainants. A copy of the identity document has been requested as it was the only way in which the company has so far been able to verify the identity of the customer. In addition to a copy of the identity document, the complainants were required to submit a written form. The information requested in the written form and why it was necessary is presented by the company in essence as follows. The name has been requested to confirm the identity of the data subject. The email address has been requested because it is used as a unique identifier of customers in the company’s system. The signature has also been requested and is, according to the company, a necessary information for the company to be able to ensure that the data subject has read the information and given his or her consent to the handling of the request. As regards the verification of the identity of the complainants, the company states that both complainants made purchases where they were identified through the company’s payment service provided by Klarna. It appears from the company’s statements that it was not required that the company itself verified the identity of the complainants when the customer relationship was established, i.e. at the time of purchase. IMY states that the company cannot require more personal data when the complainant wishes to exercise its rights than was required when establishing the customer relationship. A copy of the identity document and signature is information that the company has not requested at the establishment of the customer relationship in these two cases. Furthermore, IMY takes into account that, according to the EDPB Guidelines on the right of access, the use of a copy of an identity document as part of the authentication process should be considered inappropriate, unless strictly necessary, suitable and in line with national law. IMY considers that the requirement to provide the controller with a copy of its identity document is an intrusive measure, which is only appropriate where the controller has previously ensured the actual identity of the data subject and where alternative less intrusive means of verification are inappropriate. IMY considers that there have been no circumstances identified that speak against that other, less intrusive, verification methods could have been used in the present cases, such as login via My Pages or control questions. IMY notes that it has therefore not appeared in the case that the request for a copy of the identity document or the signature would have been absolutely necessary or appropriate. Against this background, IMY considers that the copy of the identity document and the signature cannot therefore be considered to have been necessary to confirm the identity of the complainants in accordance with Article 12(6) of the GDPR. Has the company acted in accordance with 12(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation when the company requested the complainants to send the information by mail? The next question is whether it has been permissible to require the complainants to send the requested information to the company by regular mail.Privacy Protection Authority Our ref: IMY-2022-1032 7(8) Date:2022-12-12 In view of the requirements to facilitate the exercise of the data subject’s rights in Article 12(2) GDPR, it can only be accepted in exceptional cases that a controller as the sole channel of contact refers individuals to ordinary mail if they have to submit information in order to ensure their identities, for example if it is justifiable for reasons of security. The starting point should be that alternative means of submitting requested information should be offered. In that regard, the company has mainly stated that it required the information to be sent by regular mail in order to ensure that they received the original written documentation. IMY takes the view that the transmission of a copy of an identity document may indeed pose particular risks, which may justify requiring that the document be sent by mail. This provided that it is necessary information to confirm the identity of the data subject. In the present cases, IMY concludes above that a copy of the identity document was not necessary to confirm the identity of the complainants. By requiring the complainants additionally to send the information by regular mail, IMY takes the view that the company did not facilitate for the complainants to exercise their right to erasure. IMY therefore considers that the company thereby acted in breach of Article 12(2) of the GDPR. Choice of corrective measure It follows from Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83(2) of the GDPR that IMY has the power to impose administrative fines in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the circumstances of the case, administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or in place of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2), such as injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83(2) determines the factors to be taken into account when imposing administrative fines and when determining the amount of the fine. In the case of a minor infringement, IMY may, as stated in recital 148, instead of imposing a fine, issue a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b). Account needs to be taken to the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement as well as past infringements of relevance. IMY notes the following relevant facts. It has emerged from the investigation in the case that a copy of an identity document and signature is no longer requested by Lensway Group AB upon requests from data subjects to exercise their right to erasure under the GDPR. Furthermore, the infringements found have occurred relatively far back in time (2020) and have affected two data subjects. Against this background, IMY considers that it is a minor infringement within the meaning of recital 148 and that Lensway Group AB must be given a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This decision has been taken by the specially appointed decision-maker, legal advisor , following a presentation by legal advisoPrivacy Protection Authority Our ref: IMY-2022-1032 8(8) Date:2022-12-12 How to appeal If you wish to appeal IMY:s decision, please write to IMY.

IMY gives Verisure Sverige AB a reprimand based on Article 58.2 b i the data protection regulation for the established violation. Account of the supervisory matter Background The Swedish Privacy Protection Authority (IMY) has taken note of information in the media such as, among other things claims that employees of Verisure Sverige AB (hereinafter ""Verisure"" or the company"") i in connection with incoming alarms have shared footage from cameras in private individuals' homes between themselves in different ways without it being justified. IMY has therefore initiated supervision of Verisure for the purpose of investigating the company's internal handling of image material from cameras installed in customers' homes. After the start of the inspection, IMY has received tips regarding Verisure's technical and organizational security measures. Verisure has been given the opportunity to make a statement with reason hence. What emerged in the case Postal address: Verisure has, among other things, stated the following. Box 8114 104 20 Stockholm About the data in the media Website: The company has taken the information in the media reporting very seriously and has added www.imy.se great resources to investigate the claims in the current newspaper article. However, Verisure takes E-mail: imy@imy.se 1Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with Telephone: regarding the processing of personal data and on the free flow of such data and on the cancellation of 08-657 61 00 directive 95/46/EC (general data protection regulation). Data Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1558 2(10) Date: 2024-11-27 distance from the information in the media in that nothing in the company's extensive internal investigation indicates that there would be scope for such processing of image material as described or that similar treatment actually takes place. The internal investigation has among other things consisted of interviews with employees and former employees, a technical review of log data to check whether image material has been handled on a deviating ways, review of the alarm operators' chat groups and a review of the technical limitations in the company's system to identify any deficiencies which could enable incorrect processing of the image material. The company's internal investigation has also involved a review of the list of handled cases regarding the request for register extracts in accordance with the data protection regulation, and a review of compliance with the applicable data protection regulations and the internal the regulatory framework. Furthermore, the internal investigation has included an examination of the data protection-related training initiatives that the company carries out for new employees and i the ongoing work. The results of the internal investigation show that there is nothing to indicate that there has been improper sharing of personal customer information in the manner described in the media. In the internal investigation, Verisure was also unable to find any evidence or otherwise something that suggests ongoing or current violations of the internal regulations. The company also has an established whistleblower channel that has been used by employees in other contexts but there are no reported events to suggest that improper handling of image material has been reported via that channel. Had the claims in the media been true, however, there would have been no legal basis for such obviously unauthorized processing of personal data. About Verisure's handling of personal data from customers' cameras in general Verisure is an authorized alarm center which imposes extensive regulatory requirements the business. Verisure takes its responsibility as a personal data controller very seriously and works in a structured manner with privacy and data protection issues to safeguard them registered interests. Customer privacy is an integral and crucial part of Verisure's business. The company has, among other things, an extensive internal regulatory framework in place of guidelines and routines. The company's internal policy clearly states how the alarm operators may handle image material and in which situations they may look at the images or ask a colleague to look. As one As a privacy-enhancing measure, Verisure has also implemented detailed instructions regarding how the cameras may be installed so as not to risk violating the personal integrity. Verisure has also implemented technical limitations that ensure that image material is only processed if it is necessary to achieve the purpose of the treatment. The image material is available to authorized personnel in the company's system for a certain time, thereafter it is automatically deleted from the system but archived for a further time, among other things the need to be able to share images with law enforcement agencies. Verisure has made the assessment that the time the image material is saved is a sufficiently long period for the company to store the image files in order to, taking into account the clear privacy interest still be able to fulfill the company's purposes with the processing. For example, there may be need to be able to follow up on how a certain incident has been handled or to be able to respond customers' questions about a particular incident that requires access to visual material. All image views in the company's system are logged. It is technically impossible to gain access to the image material without it being logged. This means that if there is no log of the Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1558 3(10) Date: 2024-11-27 handling of images in the system, Verisure can state with certainty that it does not no access occurred. That all handling of the image material is logged makes it possible investigation of unauthorized access to the material. As a general rule, image material should not be exported from Verisure's system. However, there is exceptions where Veirsure is entitled to share images why there is an opportunity to export images in special cases. This feature is subject to access restrictions and actions are logged, so it is always possible to track how an image has been shared. Verisure only has the ability to investigate misconduct of the type alleged in media during a certain period backwards in time when image material is deleted from the system i in accordance with the company's automatic thinning routines. Log data in the form of images filenames have, however, been saved for a slightly longer time, namely 100 days, before these too data was deleted. With this information, Verisure has been able to check how many times a particular operator has opened an image. Since August 2022 has an adjustment of the storage time for log data has taken place. The adjustment means that all log data, except for images, stored for five years. The adjustment regarding the storage time for the log data is partly a result of the need to be able to investigate image processing over a longer period of time period back in time. About the tips Regarding the first tip received by IMY about the correct login information the information largely disagrees with Verisure's view. There have been good ones reasons for the current use of a certain type of login information and the procedure has been designed taking into account the relevant data protection legislation. The usage has also continued for a limited time and has now been discontinued. Regarding the two other tips, Verisure is not to be considered the personal data controller for those described the treatments. In the one tip, one of Verisure's franchisees also has personal data officer has clearly acted outside of his instructions and the company is therefore to be considered the personal data controller for the event in question. Although Verisure is not responsible for personal data for the current processing, the company has, however, taken tip very seriously and acted accordingly. Among other things, Verisure has assisted the person in question the franchisee in the investigation of the incident described in the tip. The second tip concerns another company. The extent of IMY's review of the case The Data Protection Regulation contains a large number of rules that must be followed in conjunction with the processing of personal data. Within the framework of this supervisory matter, IMY reviews not all rules and issues that can be actualized in Verisure's operations. IMY's review of the case has been limited to include what is described in the media the processing of personal data and to intend to the extent that the company has taken appropriate technical measures and organizational measures to protect the personal data of the company's customers at it the internal handling of image material in accordance with Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. Justification of the decision Applicable regulations According to Article 4.7 of the Data Protection Regulation, the person in charge of personal data is a physical or legal person, public authority, institution or other body that alone or the Swedish Data Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1558 4(10) Date: 2024-11-27 together with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. According to the principle of responsibility in Article 5.2 of the Data Protection Regulation, it must personal data controller responsible for compliance with the principles described in first paragraph of the article, including the security principle (article 5.1 f i data protection regulation). The liability principle has been further developed in Article 24 where it appears that the person in charge of personal data must take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing is carried out in in accordance with the data protection regulation. It follows from Article 28.10 of the data protection regulation that about a personal data assistant violates this regulation by establishing the purposes and means of the processing, the personal data assistant shall be considered a personal data controller with with respect to that treatment, without prejudice to the application of Articles 82, 83 and 84. It follows from Article 32.1 of the data protection regulation that the person in charge of personal data must take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a safety level that is appropriate in relation to the risk of the treatment. At the assessment of which technical and organizational measures are appropriate must data controller take into account the latest developments, implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment as well as the risks for rights and freedoms of natural persons. According to Article 32(1), appropriate safeguards include, where appropriate, a) pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data, b) the ability to continuously ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of treatment systems and services, c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data i reasonable time in the event of a physical or technical incident, and d) a procedure for regularly testing, examining and evaluating effectiveness in the technical and organizational measures that must ensure the safety of the treatment. According to article 32.2 of the data protection regulation, when assessing the appropriate security level special consideration is given to the risks that the treatment entails, in particular for accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or for unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise treated. Personal data responsibility Personal data responsibility in the tips Verisure has stated that the company is the personal data controller for it personal data processing as the first hint about login details has intended, which is supported by the investigation into the case. IMY assesses that Verisure is personal data controller for that processing in the sense referred to in Article 4.7 i data protection regulation. As for the other two tips, Verisure has stated that the company is not personal data controller for the described treatments. Regarding the one tip, the Swedish Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1558 5(10) Date: 2024-11-27 IMY assesses that in the light of the current tip the nature of the personal data processing, there is no reason to question that the processing has been completed outside the instructions given to the data controller and that Verisure is therefore not to be considered the personal data controller. Regarding the second tip, IMY notes that there is no reason to question that another company is responsible for personal data for it the treatment. IMY therefore assesses that Verisure is not responsible for personal data the treatments that these two tips refer to why these treatments are not covered the further examination in this decision. Responsibility for personal data in general Verisure has stated that the company is responsible for the processing of personal data personal data in the form of images within the framework of the company's incident management. Verisure has also stated that the company is jointly responsible for personal data with the customer for the monitoring that the customer himself undertakes by using Verisures monitoring function in their home, plot and other private buildings. According to Verisure despite this, however, the company will also be considered the sole controller of personal data regarding the treatment of the so-called private exception in Article 2.2 c i the data protection regulation is applicable to the customer. This when the customer's treatment of personal data in that case falls outside the scope of the data protection regulation. What Verisure stated is supported by other investigations in the case. IMY therefore assesses that Verisure is the personal data controller for the current personal data processing in it meaning referred to in Article 4.7 of the Data Protection Regulation. The tip about login details In the tip, it has been claimed that Verisure used a certain type of login information a way that could contravene the data protection regulation. Against the background of what Verisure stated about the use of the current login details and what i other findings in the investigation, however, IMY cannot establish any deficiency in relation to the data protection regulation. The handling of images alleged in the media In the media reporting that IMY took part in before the supervision of Verisure began it was alleged that employees at Verisure shared information about pictures of scantily clad women people between them and that several of the employees took part in the images through the company's alarm management system for entertainment purposes. The current news article did too concerning that pictures could be sent between employees, including in a chat program. IMY states that the treatment of image material that has been described in the media is very serious and could mean a major intrusion into the personal privacy of individuals integrity. Such processing would, as Verisure has also stated, lack legal validity basis in Article 6 of the Data Protection Regulation and thus be impermissible. To be able to establish a deficiency according to the data protection regulation, however, it must be clear that the processing of image material described in the media has taken place. Verisure has reported on the internal investigation that the company undertook to investigate the information in the media and has stated that nothing emerged in the investigation which indicates that handling of image material has taken place in the way that has been described in the media. IMY notes that Verisure has undertaken an extensive internal investigation to investigate the alleged handling of image material. The company's internal investigation has not shown that the Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1558 6(10) Date: 2024-11-27 what has been claimed in the media has occurred. Nor has it through IMY's investigation i the case in general could be shown that what was described in the media has happened. IMY assesses because the investigation in the matter does not support that Verisure has failed to comply of the data protection regulation in the way that has been described in the media. Verisure has not taken appropriate security measures Against the background of what emerged from the investigation in the case, IMY finds reason, however to test whether Verisure has taken appropriate measures to ensure a level of protection which is appropriate based on the risks of the treatment. The treatment involved major privacy risks and required a high level of protection The person in charge of personal data must provide security that is suitable from the outside the risks of the treatment. The assessment of the appropriate level of protection must be done with consideration of, among other things, the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing as well as the risks, of varying degrees of probability and seriousness, for natural persons rights and freedoms. During the assessment, special consideration must be given to the risks that the processing entails, among other things, unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data. IMY states that Verisure handles personal data from a large company in its operations 2 number of registrants. IMY further states that it is an alarm management service where cameras installed in private individuals' homes are part of that service. The treatment of personal data that takes place through this is therefore, among other things, collection and handling of image material consists of people who are in their home environment. This is a very privacy-sensitive treatment. Furthermore, it can be stated that people who are customers of Verisure have hired the company for safety and security purposes and relies on the cameras installed in the home being used only by Verisure to ensure this purpose. It is therefore a matter of processing personal data for which data subjects have legitimate expectations of a high degree of confidentiality and robust protection against unauthorized and unauthorized processing. This type of personal data processing also takes place within the framework of Verisures core business, which entails even higher requirements for the level of protection. Considering, among other things, that the data processed by Verisure has been deleted privacy-sensitive nature and affected a large number of people has the company's treatment of personal data in total meant a high risk for the rights of natural persons and freedoms. The nature, extent and context of the treatment have thus resulted in a requirements for a high level of data protection. The measures must, among other things, ensure that personal data is protected against unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access. The data has not been adequately protected The IMY shall then assess whether Verisure has ensured the high level of protection which required. In order to be able to maintain the security of the personal data processed in a business's system, it is fundamental to be able to have control over what is happening, and what has happened to the data. For the registered person, there is also a right to receive access to their personal data and information about how the data has been processed. So that the data subject can exercise this right and thereby, among other things being able to check the legality of the processing is fundamental to it 2According to Verisure's website, the company has approximately 500,000 Swedish customers, see Verisure, ""About us"". https://www.verisure.se/om-oss \[2024-11-27\]The Swedish Data Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1558 7(10) Date: 2024-11-27 personal data controller has control over how the data is processed or has treated. This can, for example, be done through logging. From the investigation into the matter, it appears that the image material is stored in a certain predetermined location time and is subsequently deleted from the system. After this period it is not possible to search operators' handling of individual images. In the context of image management, however, logging is done also other tasks closely related to the image management for a slightly longer time time. Before August 2022, log data was saved in the form of the images' file names in a total of 100 days. This log entry makes it possible to check how many times a particular operator has opened an image. Regarding the storage time for Verisure's log data, IMY makes the following assessment. Image material from customers' cameras in the home are, as previously established, associated with a weighty privacy interest. In light of this and the purposes with the treatment that Verisure has described and what the company otherwise stated believes IMY that the time Verisure stores the image material is proportional. However, there are other less privacy-sensitive log data that can be used to check that image material is not handled in an inappropriate manner and thus ensure that personal data is protected against unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access. Log information in the form of the file names of the images is one such log information with which you can search how many times a certain image has been opened in the system. According to Verisure has however, these log data were only stored for 100 days, which resulted in no search of possible mishandling of image material could not be done after this period. With taking into account the high level of protection that has been required for the personal data assesses IMY that the current storage time for log information about the file names of the images has been for card to protect the data against unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access in sufficient degree and to ensure the confidentiality of the personal data processed in their system. IMY therefore assesses that Verisure has not taken appropriate technical and organizational measures measures to ensure a level of security that was appropriate in relation to the risk with the treatment. The reason for this is that Verisure has not stored log information about the images' file names long enough to be able to search for possible mishandling of personal data in the form of images from customers' cameras. Through this, Verisure has also lacked the ability to sufficiently ensure the protection of those registered rights. Verisure has, however, within the framework of a general review of storage times during the period of IMY's supervision, implemented a new retention time for the images' file names which means that log information about the file names since August 2022 is saved for five years. Verisure has stated that the adjustment of the storage time of the file names is partly a result of the need to be able investigate image processing over a longer period back in time. Through this adjustment IMY considers that, since August 2022, Verisure no longer fails to comply with the data protection regulation in the manner described above. Within the framework of this supervision, Verisure has also reported on other technical and organizational security measures that the company has taken to protect customers personal data in the internal handling of image material. On account of what 3 Cf. the judgment of the European Court of Justice Pankki S, C-579/21, EU:C:2023:501, paragraphs 37-83. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1558 8(10) Date: 2024-11-27 Verisure stated in this part, IMY notes that it has not emerged other than that they the other protective measures appear to be appropriate. Overall, IMY assesses that Verisure has processed personal data in violation of article 32.1 of the data protection regulation. It can be deduced from the investigation in the case that it limited storage time for the current log data has existed at least since the time of the initiation of supervision on 20 April 2022 until August 2022. IMY therefore assesses that Verisure has processed personal data in violation of data protection regulation during the period from 20 April 2022 to August 2022. Choice of intervention From article 58.2 i and article 83.2 of the data protection regulation it appears that IMY has power to impose administrative penalty charges in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, administrative penalty fees are imposed in addition to or instead of the other measures referred to in article 58.2, such as injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, it is clear from article 83.2 which factors to be taken into account when deciding whether administrative penalty charges are to be imposed and when determining the size of the fee. If it is a minor violation receives IMY as set out in recital 148 in lieu of imposing a penalty charge issue a reprimand in accordance with Article 58.2 b. Consideration shall be given to aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, such as the nature of the violation, degree of severity and duration as well as previous violations of relevance. When assessing the choice of intervention, IMY considers the following. IMY has assessed that Verisure has violated Article 32.1 of the Data Protection Regulation by, in the meantime, April 20, 2022 to August 2022 have not stored log information about the file names of the images long enough to be able to investigate possible mishandling of personal data and in this way, among other things, be able to ensure that the personal data is protected against unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access. A violation of that provision may incur a penalty charge. Images containing people in their home environment are very sensitive to privacy personal data. Unauthorized disclosure or access to such personal data entails a high risk to the freedoms and rights of the data subjects. Verisure has lacked the ability to search for possible mishandling of the personal data further back in time than 100 days, which means a risk that unauthorized disclosure or access could have taken place without that Verisure had the ability to control this and take any appropriate measures. However, Verisure has within the scope of an internal review, among other things, to do so possible to investigate image processing further back in time, changed the storage time for them the current log data in such a way that they are now stored for five years. This was indeed done after IMY started the current supervision, but means that Verisure has thereby taken action the lack. Furthermore, the identified deficiency has not in itself meant that personal data has processed in an impermissible manner but does not concern the possibility of being able to check afterwards the processing of the data. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1558 9(10) Date: 2024-11-27 In an overall assessment of the circumstances of the case, IMY finds that there is a question if such a minor infringement within the meaning of recital 148 exists reason to refrain from imposing a penalty fee on Verisure for the found the violation. Verisure shall therefore, with the support of Article 58.2 b i the data protection regulation, instead a reprimand is given for the found the violation. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This decision has been made by unit manager Jenny Bård after a presentation by Department Counsel Sarah Bodlander.

The Swedish Privacy Protection Authority gives Verifiera AB a reprimand according to article 58.2 b i the data protection regulation for the established violation. The Privacy Protection Authority orders Verifiera AB according to article 58.2 d i data protection regulation to take measures so that in the services that Verifiera offers on www.verifiera.se is no longer possible for users of the services to search on people with one of the search parameters personal name, social security number or address take part in decisions in cases according to the act (1991:1128) on compulsory psychiatric care or the law (1988:870) on treatment of drug addicts in certain cases that applies to the wanted person the person. The measures must have been taken no later than eight weeks after this decision won cook power. Account of the supervisory matter The Swedish Privacy Protection Authority (IMY) has received complaints regarding Verifiera AB's (Verify or the company) services. IMY has subsequently on its own initiative initiated supervision of Verify against the background of the description of its services (hereinafter ""the Services"") which the company has provided on its website www.verifiera.se (hereinafter the ""Website""). 2 The purpose of the inspection was to investigate whether Verify through the provision of The services: • publishes sensitive personal data in such a way as referred to in ch. 1. 20 § YGL, • processes personal data in a manner that is compatible with the principles of legality, correctness, transparency, purpose limitation and data minimization (Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation), • has support in some legal basis for the processing of personal data (Article 6 i the data protection regulation), and • processes information about health, i.e. sensitive personal data in that sense as referred to in article 9.1 of the data protection regulation, and in that case if any of the exceptions in Article 9.2 of the Data Protection Regulation from the prohibition of processing of such data is applicable. The supervision has taken place through review of the information that Verifiera entered the services on the Website and correspondence. 1Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regarding the processing of personal data and on the free flow of such data and on the cancellation of directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). 2For a description of the services, see below under the headings ""Information about the Services on the Website"" and ""What Verifiera AB has stated"".

The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 6(28) Date: 2022-09-13 During previous checks of the Website, IMY has observed a web page where it is described which documents the legal database contains. The corresponding page no longer seems to be accessible from Verified home page but the linking URL is still working per on April 6, 2022. In the enumeration of target types on from the administrative rights is indicated including the following: • Social security goals, i.e. cases regarding disputes with the Swedish Social Insurance Agency i matters relating to e.g. worker's compensation, parental allowance or various supports to the disabled. • LVU cases (cases according to the law with special provisions on the care of young people), i.e. goals such as is about whether minors must be looked after under duress outside their own home. • LVM cases (cases according to the Act on the care of drug addicts in certain cases), i.e. goals that is about forced care for drug addicts. • Psychiatry goals, i.e. cases dealing with matters relating to compulsory psychiatric care and forensic psychiatric care. What Verifiera AB has stated Opinion on 27 May 2022 Verifiera AB has essentially stated the following in its opinion on 27 May 2022. Verifiera is a Swedish limited company with a certificate of issuance for its operations. On November 2, 2016, the Authority for Radio and Television issued a release certificate for Verifiera.se. The business is therefore constitutionally protected according to freedom of expression the constitution. Something that is also whitewashed by IMY on the authority's website: ""The Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) does not affect businesses with certificates of issue."" It follows from the constitution that the GDPR shall not be applied to activities covered by the freedom of expression basis. Even outside the scope of the Freedom of Expression Act, it is exempted GDPR through the general exceptions for journalistic purposes as well as motivational statements about the importance of the right to freedom of expression in a democratic society. IMY's supervision involves a violation of the authority's authority and competence. To IMY lacks authority and authority is also evident from the authority's response website on the question of whether to submit complaints to IMY on sites that have proof of issue: “No. Unfortunately, we have no way of getting those types of sites to be removed information if you send us a complaint. To provide feedback regarding the legislation regarding issuance certificates, we recommend that you contact the legislator, in this case the Constitution Committee. They are responsible for preparing questions of constitutional and administrative law significance.” On the Website, Verifiera provides, within the scope of its certificate of issuance, among otherwise scanned judgments obtained from Sweden's Courts. The actions are public and accessible to the common man, credit companies and other equivalents services, which follows from the Swedish principle of openness. Verifiera is a news agency regarding, among other things, research and background checks. Verifiera uses a subscription form which means that mainly different types of organizations and professional actors with a need for the information on The website in its professional practice, for example companies and authorities, uses of the Website. Only paying users can access the material on The website, after which the users can, through active measures in real time, receive information from the Integrity Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 7(28) Date: 2022-09-13 and decisions which are scanned and available on the Website. Before a customer signs an agreement with Verifiera, the customer can try the service for fourteen days during condition that the customer undergoes a demonstration of the service. During the trial period are offered access to a standard subscription. Through its activities, Verifiera contributes to free and comprehensive information on an appropriate basis way. Verified's business is also not unique. On the contrary, the equivalent is provided service or more extensive services since a long time from well-established services (eg www.infotorg.se and www.juno.se, formerly Karnov). Like these services, it is possible to The website find judgments and decisions, including administrative law judgments through free text search or through more specific search fields (called filters in some databases). Because the documents on the Website consist of public documents that are available for anyone to take part in many places other than the Website, not least through other services such as or the courts or authorities themselves, thereby there is no particular risk with the publication that takes place on the Website. The background extension service enables customers, through a consent request from the person to whom the background check relates, obtain a background check report regarding any ongoing or previous legal disputes. The legal data is retrieved from courts and authorities and consists of public documents. A prerequisite for one such background report is that the person in question agrees to this, verification takes place including bank ID. The service has no connection to the data protection regulation. As for Verifiera's data and IT security, it is very high. The company has its own servers located in data centers within the EU. Verify using software that is not accessible via the internet which means that all services are isolated from each other as well internet. Only Verified CTO and Network Administrator have access to the software. In case an IP address is available from the internet, it is protected with one firewall bound to specific IP addresses. All Verifiera's systems are built with protection against various types of IT attacks. With regard to decisions on health care, information on the state of health of individuals applies strong confidentiality, which means that such information may only be disclosed if it is clear that the individual or someone close to him does not suffer but. The same applies in other medical activities, for example forensic and forensic psychiatric examination. Judgments and decisions relating to such conditions are subject to confidentiality and the courts therefore does not disclose information about health or the like. Then the judgments found on The website corresponds to those at the court, the same applies to the documents available on the Website. Opinion on 13 June 2022 Verifiera AB has essentially stated the following in its opinion on 13 June 2022. Introduction and general Verify maintains the positions expressed in the opinion of May 27, 2022. It is Verifiera's opinion that IMY lacks any right to initiate the present review as well as to exercise supervision over Verify. The relationship to Verify in a more detailed way answering questions regarding compliance with the data protection regulation does not mean that Verify that the data protection regulation is applicable or that IMY at all has the right to conduct the review that is carried out. Concepts such as ""personal data treatment"" and more are used even if Verifiera's view is that the company's Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 8(28) Date: 2022-09-13 handling of public documents does not constitute a processing of ""personal data"" which covered by the data protection regulation. The purposes of the personal data processing carried out in the services Verify provides general documents to the users of the Services for the purpose of carry out their constitutionally protected activities and in a wider sense promote a all-round information and a free opinion formation. Who decides on the purposes and means of the processing in the respective service Verify decides on the purposes and means of the ""personal data processing"" of The services. Verifiera would like to point out, however, that from a journalistic point of view it is the user who decides on the purposes, in the same way as a newspaper reader himself determines the purpose when this takes part in a published journal, and not the newsroom that published the newspaper. If consent is collected from affected persons before processing in any of the services Consent in the sense referred to in article 6.1 a of the data protection regulation, and express consent in the sense referred to in 9.2 a, is collected in connection with background checks in the Background Supplement Service from the person to whom the check applies. The service enables customers, through a consent request from the person who the background check refers to obtaining a background check report regarding any ongoing or past legal disputes. The legal data is taken from courts and authorities and consists of public documents. A prerequisite for such background report is that the person in question agrees to this and verification takes place among other with bank ID. Consent is not otherwise collected. Legal basis for the processing and circumstances showing that it is valid The processing in the Services is necessary to protect the interests of fundamental importance for the data subject or for another natural person, i.e. the public's right to freedom of expression and access to public documents, etc. The processing in the Services is necessary for purposes related to Verified eligible interest in being able to run their constitutionally protected activities within the framework of their certificate of issue. The processing in the Services is necessary for purposes that concern the common man legitimate interest in, within the framework of Verifiera's constitutional protection, being informed of public documents available in the Services. In the present case, the interests of the ""registered"" do not outweigh the right to freedom of expression. hot. The documents found in the Services are available through several others sources. The type of court decision in question should be uninteresting then courts have to apply confidentiality to the extent that information about health is present. If information about health in the sense referred to in Article 9.1 is processed Verifiera has understood it to mean that IMY's review refers to information in court decisions from the general administrative courts. Administrative courts rule over a wide range of legal areas, the majority of which are Torde lacking any relevance for IMY such as cases of tax, PBL, migration, legality review, driver's license interventions, different types of permits, foundations, land and environment, animal welfare, public procurement etc. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 9(28) Date: 2022-09-13 IMY has not specified in more detail exactly which target types they think it can contain ""sensitive personal data"", however some exemplification has been done. Furthermore, IMY has not asserted the extent to which they believe such targets contain “sensitive personal data"" but seem to draw all exemplary target types under the same roof, an order that Verify questions. It is possible that some target types may, to an unknown extent, contain data regarding people's health. However, as stated above, the courts have to follow one strict confidentiality regarding health and similar information. Is a judgment from one administrative court public (and not protected by secrecy), are also data, in it to the extent such are apparent, public. Courts are generally reticent to state data that can in any way be described as ""sensitive"". The courts limit the information in judgments to the level necessary to explain the outcome i the target. To the extent that a court decision nevertheless contains information that can is designated as ""sensitive"", the processing is necessary, among other things, with regard to a important public interest on the basis of Swedish law. The treatment done by Verify is commensurate with the purpose pursued and is also consistent with the how rules on data protection must be processed within the constitutionally protected area. What information is provided to the persons concerned Verifiera provides information about the content on Verifiera.se to its users. One registered has the opportunity to become a user on Verifiera.se and can thus take part in the public documents available there. If users of the Background Check service receive information that they are wanted the person appears as the appellant in cases of compulsory psychiatric care Users of the Services get access to the information available on the Website and that including any judgments that may affect them. Information about judgments provided on the Website is clearly stated. Regarding the background control function, refer to what was stated above. Any changes made to the Services compared to the description which appeared on the website on April 4, 2022 No changes have been made. To the extent that a law is issued on prohibitions regarding personal data relating to health, Verifiera will review its operations on expedient manner. Addendum regarding ch. 1 Section 20 YGL From the wording of ch. 1. Section 20 YGL states that the YGL does not prevent it from being announced by law regulations on prohibition of publication of personal data. In the preparatory work for ch. 1. Section 20 YGL does not state that the data protection regulation would be applicable to the provision. That would have been the case if it was intended that it, contrary to the provision wording, would accommodate other laws on prohibition. By comment to YGL on Juno it appears that the delegation provision has not been followed up by any legislation. It is not possible to interpret a constitution for its purpose. It is not possible to see what consequences a possible negative decision may have and the legal situation afterwards such a decision will be highly unclear. A legally secure course of action would have been to await a possible law of prohibition before starting a review. Then had Verify had knowledge of the legal situation and the content of any prohibition. Verify had then able to act and adapt accordingly. Current review lacks all forms of the Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 10(28) Date: 2022-09-13 predictability and legal certainty. Verified's view is that the review as such and any negative decision containing corrective measures may constitute abuse of authority. The Credit Information Act – a comparative outlook In the constitutions, there are provisions regarding credit information activities (which includes operations with certificates of issue) that do not prevent it from being notified regulations on the prohibition of such activities in certain specific situations. Such regulations have, with the support of delegation provisions in the constitution, been introduced in the Credit Information Act, whereby special references are expressly made to the data protection regulation and the data protection act. It also expressly states that IMY is the supervisory authority. In these respects, IMY thus derives its authority from law and has through express provisions in law introduced with the support of delegation provision right to apply the data protection regulation in certain expressly stated respects. All this is missing now. In the present case, the delegation provision in ch. 1. Section 20 YGL has not been utilized and IMY lacks both the authorization and the authority to review Verified constitutionally protected activities. Especially about other databases As stated above, Verifiera's business is not unique. Corresponding service or more comprehensive services are provided by long-established services. As a result of IMY's review, Verifiera has carried out searches for such well-established services, for example juno.se. On juno.se, Verifiera has received hits on wanted social security numbers, names and addresses. These search results show Verified operations follow the industry standard for operations with certificates of issue and that If verified, the activity is not improper, on the contrary, the activity is essential in everything the same as with the market-leading companies in the industry. A decision that the data protection regulation is applicable would have unforeseeable consequences consequences for the entire industry. In light of this and what is stated in paragraph above, it is very strange that IMY chooses to turn to Verify instead of the well-established market-leading companies in the industry as is customary. Limitation of the trial frame i the review Against the background of the nature of the matter - including the answers that Verifiera has provided – IMY limits its examination of the Services during the relevant period to • about 1 ch. § 20 YGL is applicable regarding the collection of data in the Services, • on the exception for journalistic purposes ch. 1 Section 7, second paragraph of the Act (2018:218) with supplementary provisions to the EU's data protection regulation is applicable for the processing in the Services and • if the company processes personal data about health in the sense referred to in Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation by including rulings in cases under the law on compulsory psychiatric treatment and according to the law on treatment of drug addicts in the Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 11(28) Date: 2022-09-13 certain cases in the data collection and, if so, whether the processing is compatible with Article 9. The review therefore does not cover whether Verified is processing personal data in the Services is otherwise compatible with the data protection regulation. The trial also does not cover one assessment about Verify, by disclosing in the Services financial information about private persons, conducts credit reporting activities and if this is the case compatible with the provisions of the Credit Information Act (1973:1173) and data protection the regulation. Justification of the decision Legal background EU law's regulation of the relationship between the right to protection of personal data and the right to freedom of expression and information The purpose of the Data Protection Regulation is to protect personal integrity in processing of personal data and harmonizing the data protection regulation in order to enable a free flow of personal data within the EU. In the data protection regulation specifies the fundamental right to protection of personal data which is established in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (below the charter). According to Article 8.1 of the charter, everyone shall have the right to protection of the personal data concerning him or her. According to Article 8.2, personal data must processed lawfully for specific purposes and on the basis of the data subject consent or any other legitimate and lawful basis. Everyone has the right to receive access to collected data concerning him or her and to have it rectified. IN Article 8.3 stipulates that an independent authority must check that these rules is complied with. A right that is closely linked with the right to protection for personal data is the right to respect for private life and family life which is laid down in Article 7 of the charter. Article 11 of the charter establishes the right to freedom of expression and information. There it is stipulated that everyone has the right to freedom of expression. It is further stipulated that this right includes freedom of opinion and freedom to receive and disseminate information and thoughts without public authority involvement and independence from territorial boundaries. Neither the right to protection of personal data nor the right to opinion and freedom of information are absolute rights. Article 52.1 of the charter states that limitations in the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognized in the charter shall be prescribed by law and compatible with the essential content of these rights and freedoms. Furthermore, it is stated that limitations, taking into account proportionality principle, may only be done if they are necessary and actually meet the objectives of public interest recognized by the Union or the need for protection of others people's rights and freedoms. Against this background, the Data Protection Ordinance has been designed with regard to other freedoms and rights other than the right to protection of personal data, including opinion and freedom of information. The task of balancing these two rights has essentially handed over to the member states within the framework of the regulation in article 85. In article 85.1 4See article 1 of the data protection regulation and i.a. recital 10 to the regulation. 5 Cf. recital 1 to the data protection regulation. 6See recital 4 of the data protection regulation. 7 Cf. the EU Court's judgment Buivids, C-345/17, EU:C:2019:122, p. 50. Data Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 12(28) Date: 2022-09-13 the data protection regulation stipulates an obligation for member states to harmonize the right to privacy according to the data protection regulation with opinion and freedom of information, including processing that takes place for journalistic purposes or for academic, artistic or literary creation. According to Article 85.2 shall Member States, for processing that takes place for journalistic purposes or for academic, artistic or literary creation, establish exceptions or deviations from chapter II (principles), chapter III (data subject's rights), chapter IV (personal data controller and personal data assistant), chapter V (transfer of personal data to third countries or international organizations), Chapter VI (independent supervisory authorities), Chapter VII (cooperation and consistency) and Chapter IX (special situations when processing personal data) if these are necessary for to reconcile the right to privacy with freedom of expression and information. Article 52 of the statute and Article 85 of the data protection regulation thus set limits for how Member States may combine the right to the protection of personal data with the right to freedom of expression and information. That the rights must be combined means that one of the rights must not be given a general priority over the other. Further get exceptions from the right to protection of personal data according to the data protection regulation only take place if 8 the exceptions are necessary to unify the rights. The European Court of Justice has stated that to make a balanced trade-off between the fundamental rights is required that exceptions and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data do not apply beyond the limits of what is strictly necessary. This statement was directive 10 95/46/EG , which was replaced by the data protection regulation, but is according to IMY's assessment relevant also in relation to the data protection regulation. The European Court of Justice has also ruled that in order to take into account the importance of freedom of expression i democratic societies, the concepts associated with this, including journalism, interpreted in a broad sense. This means, among other things, that exceptions from and limitations of the data protection regulation should not only apply to media companies, but on all persons who are active in journalism. It is clear from the court's practice further that ""journalistic activity"" is such activity that aims to disseminate information, opinions or ideas to the public, regardless of the medium this happens.11 The Swedish Data Protection Act's exception for freedom of expression and information In Swedish law, regulations based on Article 85 of the Data Protection Regulation have announced in ch. 1 Section 7 of the law (2018:218) with supplementary regulations to the EU's data protection regulation (hereinafter the data protection act). In ch. 1 Section 7, first paragraph, of the Data Protection Act, an exception is made for such processing as covered by the Freedom of Press Ordinance (TF) and the Freedom of Expression Act (YGL), below collectively referred to as the basic media laws. The said provision states that the data protection regulation and the data protection act shall not be applied to the extent that would conflict with TF or YGL. According to the preparatory work, it is thereby made clear that the basic media laws take precedence over the data protection regulation and 12 the provisions of the Data Protection Act. 8 Cf. ECJ judgment Buivids, C-345/17, EU:C:2019:122, p. 63. 9 10th ECJ judgment Buivids, C-345/17, EU:C:2019:122, p. 64. Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with 11 regarding the processing of personal data and the free flow of such data. See ECJ judgment Buivids, C-345/17, EU:C:2019:122, pp. 51–53. 1 See prop. 2017/18:105, p. 187. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 13(28) Date: 2022-09-13 The basic media laws provide far-reaching protection for freedom of expression and information. For example, according to the so-called instruction, the person who is to judge abuse should of the freedom of the press and expression – or in other ways watch over that the constitutions are complied with - always bear in mind that the freedom of the press and expression are the foundations of a free social condition, always pay attention to the subject and the thought more than the expression illegality, as well as the purpose more than the method of presentation and in doubtful cases rather free from trap (ch. 1 § 10 TF and ch. 1 § 15 YGL). Furthermore, an authority may not prohibit or impede such provision due to its content, without support i the constitution, the so-called obstruction ban (ch. 1 § 11 YGL). In addition, an authority gets nor intervene against anyone for abuse of freedom of expression, unless there is support for it the intervention in the constitution (ch. 1 § 14 YGL). In ch. 1 Section 7, second paragraph of the Data Protection Act, exceptions are made for opinion and freedom of information outside the constitutionally protected area. The exception includes processing of personal data that takes place for journalistic purposes or for academic, artistic or literary creation. It could, for example, be a matter of journalistic activity conducted in blog form but without proof of publication. IN the provision states that Articles 5–30 and 35–50 of the EU Data Protection Regulation and 2–5 chap. The Data Protection Act shall not be applied to processing that takes place for e.g. journalistic purposes. The exception means that the data protection regulation and the provisions of the Data Protection Act on supervision, remedies, liability and sanctions i the practice is applicable only to the extent of supervision of or violations of the provisions on security for personal data. 13 The basic regulation on voluntary issuance certificates Because the exception in ch. 1 Section 7 first paragraph of the Data Protection Act shall be applicable it is required that it is a question of treatment that is covered by constitutional protection according to the media fundamentals. As a general rule, publications on the internet fall outside YGL's scope scope of application. This means that the data protection regulation is normally applicable to such processing. However, exceptions to the main rule are made through among otherwise the database rule (ch. 1 § 4 YGL). For the processing of personal data such as covered by the database rule, the data protection regulation, according to ch. 1 Section 7 first paragraph the Data Protection Act, is not applied to the extent it would conflict with the freedom of expression basis. Under certain conditions, the database rule provides constitutional protection for statements that take place through provision to the public from databases. What is typically meant is provision of stored information from websites upon request. For some actors apply the constitutional protection automatically, i.e. without anyone special action needs to be taken. This is the case for periodicals and editorial boards for programs. Also other traditional mass media companies, such as book publishers that publish printed books and news agencies, have automatic constitutional protection for theirs databases. Other actors have the opportunity at the Norwegian Press, Radio and Television Authority apply for a certificate of issue and thus receive so-called voluntary constitutional protection (cf. 1 Cape. § 4 first paragraph 1 d and § 5 YGL). In the case of an application for a certificate of issue, this is done not any examination of the content or purpose of the database. The voluntary constitutional protection for databases was introduced in 2003 following a development which meant that other than the traditional mass media companies to an ever greater extent had started providing information to the public on the Internet. Other media companies and individuals had become involved in news reporting, opinion formation and the enlightenment, and the new communication was considered necessary for 13 See prop. 2017/18:105, p. 187. 14 Prop. 2021/22:59, p. 30. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 14(28) Date: 2022-09-13 freedom of expression and freedom of information. Against this background, the government did the assessment that there were reasons to offer constitutional protection equivalent to that which 15 previously had been reserved for the mass media companies also for the new actors. But already when the voluntary constitutional protection was introduced, the constitutional committee warned so that conflicts with the protection of personal integrity could arise and pointed out in particular that the constitutional protection could in the worst case include databases that are pure personal records. The Constitution Committee therefore considered that the government should further analyze or have analyzed whether the voluntary constitutional protection could come into conflict with the provisions intended to protect the personal integrity. The Riksdag agreed with the committee's assessment and 17 announced this to the government. The Free Speech Committee was tasked with analyzing the issue, but did the assessment that there was no need for constitutional amendments. The year 2014 gave the government Media Basic Law Committee tasked with re-investigating the issue. The Media Basic Law Committee made the assessment that there were reasons to restrict constitutional protection for certain types of search services and instead allow regulations on team level. The Committee therefore proposed an express exception in TF and YGL for some search services that provide sensitive personal data (among other things such as revealing political or religious views or relating to health and sexual life) and information 19 about legal violations, etc. The government agreed with the committee's assessment and proposed changes in TF and YGL in accordance with the committee's proposal. 20 The Riksdag adopted the government's proposal for amendments to TF and YGL in that part of the amendments referred to data collections with sensitive personal data but rejected the proposal in that part it concerned personal data on legal offences. However, the Riksdag announced for the government that an inquiry should be commissioned to re-investigate the question of whether limit the constitutional protection of search services that contain personal information that individuals have committed legal offences, appear in convictions or have been subject to criminal procedural coercive measures. 21 On January 1, 2019, the amendment to the basic media laws entered into force (ch. 1. 13 TF and 1 Cape. § 20 YGL). It is clear from these provisions that the provisions of the YGL do not prevents regulations being issued by law prohibiting the publication of personal data about, among other things, health (Chapter 1 § 20 first paragraph 2 YGL). This applies only if the personal data is included in a data collection that has been arranged so that it is possible to search for or compile these (chapter 1 § 20 second paragraph 1). In addition, it is required that with regard to the business and the forms under which the data collection is kept available, there are special risks of improper intrusions the personal integrity of individuals (Chapter 1 § 20 second paragraph 2). The government gave, in accordance with the Riksdag's announcement, the 2018 print and freedom of expression committee tasked with investigating the question of a restriction of the constitutional protection for data collections with information about legal violations, etc. The committee presented proposals which meant that the existing delegation provisions if sensitive personal data would be supplemented in such a way that personal data about offenses were added to the list of categories of personal data that can 15 Prop. 2001/02:74, pp. 47–48. 16 Bet. 2001/02:KU21, p. 32.

Data Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 15(28) Date: 2022-09-13 regulated by common law. The committee also proposed certain other changes in 22 the design of the existing delegation provision. The government presented proposal for changes in ch. 1 § 13 TF and ch. 1 § 20 YGL in accordance with the committee's 23 suggestions. However, the Riksdag rejected these proposals with the exception of a correction of linguistic inaccuracies in the regulations. 24 The interpretation of ch. 1 Section 20 YGL and IMY's authority According to ch. 1 § 20 first paragraph 2 YGL does not prevent the provisions of YGL that in law regulations are issued on the prohibition of publication of personal data about among other health. The first question that IMY has to decide on is thus whether the provisions of the data protection regulation constitute such prohibition regulations announced in law referred to in ch. 1. Section 20 YGL. IMY makes the assessment that the expression regulations in law in ch. 1. § 20 YGL covers EU- regulations and that regulations on prohibitions in ch. 1. § 20 YGL does not only cover clean ban on the publication of personal data but also regulations that are smaller intervention and which limit the possibility of publishing personal data. IMY does this assessment for the following reasons. When the expression ""law"" is used in Swedish constitutions in the way that occurs in ch. 1 Section 20 25 YGL the term normally covers EU regulations without being specified in the legal text. Of the preparatory work for ch. 1 Section 20 YGL states that this provision must also be interpreted accordingly this way. It states that EU regulations are equalized by law, according to the practice which developed in connection with the existing delegation provision. It is further stated that the provision also includes an opportunity to prescribe measures that are smaller 27 intervention than prohibition. Similar statements are made in the legislative matter of corollary changes in ordinary law to the changes in the basic media laws. It states that the provisions of the Data Protection Ordinance and the Data Protection Act would regulate them data collections with personal data covered by the proposed exceptions the provisions of the Freedom of the Press Ordinance and the Freedom of Expression Act (i.e. ch. 1 § 13 TF and ch. 1 § 20 YGL). Also in the bill that was prompted by the report from the 2018 Press and Freedom of Expression Committee states that the provisions of the data protection regulation constitute such regulations in law as referred to in 1 ch. Section 20 YGL. This means that the data protection regulation must be applied in those cases the conditions in ch. 1 § 20 YGL are fulfilled. In other words, exceptional the provision in ch. 1 § 7 first paragraph of the Data Protection Act not applicable to such processing because an application of the data protection regulation would not conflict with YGL. IMY is a supervisory authority according to the data protection regulation and thus authorized to exercise supervision of such treatment that is exempt from constitutional protection according to ch. 1 Section 20 YGL. This means that IMY has the authority to try whether ch. 1. § 20 YGL is applicable 2SOU 2020:45. 2 Prop. 2021/22:59. 2Bet. 2021/22:KU14 appendix 3, SEK 2021/22:283. 25 See e.g. prop. 2017/18:105, pp. 27, 127, 130 and prop. 2020/21:172, p. 258.

Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 16(28) Date: 2022-09-13 on a certain processing to clarify whether the data protection regulation is applicable 31 or not. The exception in ch. 1 § 20 YGL is applicable In order for the delegation provision in ch. 1 § 20 YGL shall be applicable to the person in question the processing of personal data in the Services requires that the following three conditions are met: 1) that sensitive personal data is made public (first paragraph), 2) that the data is part of a collection of data that has been arranged so that it is possible to search for or compile these (second paragraph 1) as well as 3) that with regard to the business and the forms in which the data is collected is kept available, there are particular risks of improper intrusion into individuals' personal privacy (second paragraph 2). Personal information about health is made public IMY states at the outset that the information included in the Services is published on the way referred to in ch. 1. Section 20 YGL. The next question is about the data that Verify provides through the Services contain such personal data as specified in 1 Cape. § 20 YGL first paragraph. As stated above, IMY has limited its review to rulings in cases in the general administrative courts under the Psychiatric Act compulsory care (LPT), so-called psychiatry cases, and according to the law on the care of drug addicts in some cases (LVM), so-called LVM targets. The sensitive personal data that may primarily appear in such rulings are information on health according to ch. 1. § 20 YGL first paragraph 2. According to the preparatory work, the concept of personal data on health has been taken from Article 9.1 i data protection regulation and shall be given the same meaning as in the regulation. 32 Data on health is defined in Article 4.15 of the Data Protection Regulation as personal data relating to a natural person's physical or mental health, including provision of healthcare services, which provide information about his health status. The European Court of Justice has ruled that the special categories of personal data specified in Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation, i.a. information about health, must be given a broad interpretation. According to the European Court of Justice, it is sufficient that the data indirectly discloses sensitive information to 33 to be covered by the protection in Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation. Further includes, according to The European Court of Justice, the concept of ""data on health"" all aspects of a person's health, 34 both physical and psychological ones. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has stated that the concept of ""information about health"" should be interpreted broadly and includes, among other things information collected by healthcare providers in a patient record (e.g. medical history and results of examinations and treatments). 35 Verifiera's own information shows that the company provides all of the Services rulings in psychiatry cases and LVM cases from the general administrative court since 2008 in unchanged condition. 31 Prop. 2021/22:59, pp. 53–54. 32 33 Prop. 2017/18:49, p. 188. 34 ECJ judgment Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisija, C-184/20, EU:C:2022:601, pp. 125–128. 35 ECJ judgment Lindqvist, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, p. 50–51. Guidelines 3/2020 on the processing of data on health for scientific research purposes in connection with covid- 19 outbreak, p. 7–8. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 17(28) Date: 2022-09-13 Section 3 of the LPT states that compulsory care according to that law may only be given if the patient is suffering of a serious mental disorder and if certain other conditions are met. According to § 4 LVM mandatory care must be ordered according to that law for someone as a result of ongoing abuse of alcohol, drugs or volatile solvents is in need of care to get away from his abuse and certain other prerequisites are met. IMY finds that information that someone is or has been the subject of compulsory care with support of LPT or LVM - which means that the prop ""suffers from a serious mental disorder"" or props ""as a result of ongoing abuse of alcohol, drugs or fugitives solvent is in need of care to get out of their addiction” is fulfilled – is information about health in the sense referred to in ch. 1. Section 20 first paragraph 2 YGL and article 9.1 of the data protection regulation. That the actual diagnosis or cause as well appears is not a prerequisite for this assessment. The decisions of the general administrative courts mainly refer to review of authorities' decisions after appeals by individuals. Some particularly drastic decisions however, is tried or made there without the individual having appealed any decision, either after the authority that made the decision submitted it to judicial review or applied about the decision to be made. This applies, among other things, to psychiatric cases, where a patient who is subject to compulsory care can appeal certain decisions connected to the care to the administrative rights (see §§ 32 and 33 LPT) while certain more intrusive decisions must is subject to review by the administrative court (see e.g. § 12 LPT) or is only taken after the authority's application to the administrative court (see e.g. § 7 LPT), regardless of the individual attitude. This also applies to LVM cases, where the court decides to prepare for compulsory care according to LVM (see § 5) or review decisions on immediate care according to LVM after submission (see §§ 15 and 17). Cases in the general administrative courts are decided by judgment or decision (collectively referred to as rulings). Such rulings must state the reasons as determined the end (section 30 second paragraph of the Administrative Procedure Act \[1971:291\]). Further shall i the decision states the parties (i.e., among other things, who has complained or who is subject for the application or the subordinated decision), the matter in brief and to the extent that an account of the judgment or decision which has been appealed is needed or subordinated (Section 13 of the Ordinance \[2013:390\] on cases in general administrative court). Against this background, IMY states that the general administrative courts rulings in psychiatry cases and LVM cases typically contain information about health the person who is the subject of compulsory care, i.e. the person who has appealed the decision which has been made with the support of the respective law or which is the subject for the application or the subordinated decision without appeal. Because such rulings in their unaltered state are provided by Verify Through The services are the criterion in ch. 1. Section 20 first paragraph YGL to sensitive personal data published fulfilled. The data collection has been arranged so that it is possible to search for or compile sensitive personal data The second question that IMY must decide on is whether the sensitive data is included in a collection of information that has been arranged so that it is possible to search for or compile these (chapter 1 section 20 second paragraph 1 YGL). Initially, it is stated that the word ""data collection"" in YGL was chosen to avoid confusion with the term ""register"", which is what is meant in normal parlance. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 18(28) Date: 2022-09-13 According to the preparatory work, no large amount of data is required, but there must be personal data relating in any case to more than one person and the data must be sorted according to some kind of system. 36 Verifiera has stated that all decisions from 2008 onwards exist and have been made searchable in the Services and, when asked, did not provide detailed information about that number decisions that are actually processed. IMY has therefore obtained the official statistics which The Courts Agency has brought up settled cases in the general administrative courts. Verifiera has had the opportunity to comment on this basis but has not submitted anything 37 opinion. The statistics show that during the period 2008–2021 there is a total of approx 210,000 decisions, of which approx. 193,000 (approx. 13,800 per year) in psychiatric cases and approx. 188 39 000 (approx. 1,300 per year) in LVM cases for rulings in the administrative courts alone. Also if it can be assumed that some of these rulings apply to the same people, it can it is established that it involves a large amount of information about health about a large amount people. According to IMY, there is no doubt that it is such a case data collection referred to in ch. 1 Section 20 second paragraph 1 YGL. With regard to the expression “arranged so that it is possible to search for or compile the tasks"" it is stated in the preparatory work that the data collection does not need to have been structured on a way that facilitates searching for exactly the personal data covered the provision. For the provision to become applicable, it is sufficient that the data collection provides the opportunity for free text searching. 40 Verifiera's own information shows that it is possible to search in the Services the data collection through free text search as well as through special fields for searches on name, social security number, city and address. The data collection has thus been arranged as follows that it is possible to search for or compile sensitive personal data in that way as referred to in ch. 1 Section 20 second paragraph 1 YGL. There are particular risks of undue intrusions into personal privacy Applicable regulations, etc. The last question for the applicability of ch. 1. § 20 YGL on which IMY has to take a position is if there are particular risks of undue intrusions into individuals' personal integrity. According to the provision, the assessment of whether there are such special risks be done with regard to the business and the forms under which the data collection is held available (chapter 1 section 20 second paragraph 2 YGL). The implication is that the scope of the provision is narrowed down and made dependent on the risks of breaching it the personal integrity that a certain type of data collection entails. So it is only for certain qualified situations, which entail special risks of impropriety intrusion into the personal integrity of individuals covered. 41 36 37 Prop. 2017/18:49, p. 150.

""The proposal therefore means that an overall assessment must be made of the nature of them data collections that are intended to be met by the applicable legal regulation. Assessment grounds of importance should, as the committee states, be able to be the target group of the data collections, the forms of provision and the services' search and compilation functions. In this lies the fact that the data collections basic structure can be attributed importance. Services that make it possible for the public to search on e.g. name, social security number or address get information about individuals' health, sex life or occurrence of criminal convictions would normally entail such risks for undue privacy breaches that they falls within the scope of the delegation provision. \[…\] Data collections with a so-called personal data related structure that aims to Facilitating searches for personal data normally means greater risks for undue breaches of privacy than services with a general structure that makes it possible to search for data with free text search, although the differences are not so great that they in themselves determine the applicability of the provision. Special search fields for someone or some of the personal data concerned or the possibility of obtaining a compilation of these, for example in the form of a map image, typically entail great risks for undue intrusions into personal privacy. In this context, it should normally irrelevant if the service is only available to professional operators. \[…\] According to the government, the starting point should be that legal databases that clearly target themselves to a circle that, on professional grounds, has a legitimate need for them the current information falls outside the scope of application of the provision. At however, the assessment should also for such databases the search and compilation functions are given importance. For example, get special search fields for any or some of the personal data concerned or the possibility of obtaining one compilation of these, for example in the form of a map image, typically said entail great risks for undue intrusions into personal integrity. Such structures should normally mean that there are conditions for legislation with support of the delegation provision, even when legislation hits databases there the information is provided for a fee and the target group is professional.” 43 The Constitution Committee stated, among other things, the following: ""The committee opposes making a distinction between whether a service addresses the general public or a certain professional category. A search service that caters to the broad the public can in and of itself mean a greater breach of privacy than a search service which is only open to a smaller circle, e.g. a certain occupational category. But also one search service that caters to a certain occupational category may become available for a very large number of users. The committee does not consider that the target group, i.e. the intended or actual user group, in itself must be given some meaning at the assessment of whether a collection of data falls within or outside it constitutionally protected area. The assessment should instead be made on the basis of 42 Prop. 2017/18:49, pp. 152–153 and 190. 43 Bet. 2017/18:KU16, p. 41. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 20(28) Date: 2022-09-13 the purpose of the provision of the data collection and the type of data provided. Privacy breaches resulting from data collections provided with the aim of contributing to a free exchange of ideas and a free and comprehensive information can are not considered inappropriate and should therefore be excluded as a starting point the scope of the delegation provisions. The committee wishes to underline that it is very important that a significant margin be applied as to what falls within the constitutionally protected area so that the interest in freedom of expression does not get give way to the interest in protecting the privacy of individuals in borderline cases or those that are difficult to judge situations. Such an approach also gains support in the so-called the instruction i the constitutions, according to which the person entrusted to judge or watch over print and freedom of expression should always bear in mind that freedom of press and expression is a foundation for a free state of society, should always pay attention to the subject and the thought more than the expression as well as the purpose more than the method of presentation and in doubtful cases rather should free than trap. Pure search services for the provision of sensitive personal data according to the exhaustive enumeration in the provision can be said to be far from them purposes which the constitutions are to protect, and such services are thus met typically by the delegation provisions.” IMY's assessment According to IMY, the reported operator's statements mean the following in summary. What the constitutional committee stated in connection with the constitutional amendment means that it when assessing the risks of privacy breaches according to ch. 1 § 20 YGL should not is any significance attached to whether a search service addresses the general public or is available for a certain occupational category. Instead, an overall assessment must be made taking into account, among other things, the purpose of providing the data collection, the type of data provided and search and aggregation functions. It should be taken into account that data collections aimed at facilitating searches for in particular, personal data normally involves greater risks. However, data collections should which is provided with the aim of contributing to a free exchange of meaning and a free and versatile information is not considered improper and should therefore be excluded as a starting point the scope of application of ch. 1 Section 20 YGL. The collection of data that Verifiera provides is the result of an extensive collection of judicial decisions in psychiatry cases and LVM cases that contain a lot privacy-sensitive information. The collection takes place without assessment of its relevance the individual decision has for e.g. the public debate or investigative journalism. The result is a collection of data on everyone who has been the subject of this since 2008 compulsory care due to mental illness or substance abuse. It also appears from the investigation that the purpose of the data collection is, among other things, to provide background checks in, for example, recruitment. Treatment of them the current data on health in such contexts can lead to noticeable consequences for the data subjects. It appears from Verifiera's own data that the data collection has been structured in this way that when searching for people, there are special search fields for name, social security number, city, address and free text and that search results are displayed in real time. Furthermore, it has not appeared to Verify taken any measures to exclude or limit the possibility of applying to data that can be directly attributed to a natural person, such as name or social security number. Nor has it appeared that Verify removed or masked such information in the documents. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 21(28) Date: 2022-09-13 According to IMY's assessment, it is a question of such a search service for the provision of sensitive personal data which, in accordance with what the constitutional committee stated in connection with the constitutional amendment, is far from the purposes for which the constitutions are intended to protect.44 All in all, this means, according to IMY's assessment, that Verified publication of the collection of data entails special risks for improper interference with individuals' personal information integrity. Thus, the third and last criterion in ch. 1 is also § 20 YGL fulfilled. Summative assessment In conclusion, IMY does – even taking into account the significant assessment margin as assigned by the constitutional committee – the assessment to Verify provides such a data collection as referred to in ch. 1. § 20 YGL, in that part the collection of information involves the publication of decisions in psychiatric cases and LVM- goal. This part of the data collection is thus not protected according to YGL, which means that the exception in ch. 1 Section 7 first paragraph of the Data Protection Act is not applicable to the treatment. The next issue that IMY has to assess is whether the exception for journalistic purposes in 1 Cape. Section 7, second paragraph, of the Data Protection Act is applicable to the processing. The processing does not take place for journalistic purposes Applicable regulations, etc. Through ch. 1 Section 7, second paragraph of the Data Protection Act exempts large parts of the data protection regulation for processing that takes place for, among other things, journalistic purposes purpose. According to the exception, articles 5–30 and 35–50 of the data protection the regulation and ch. 2–5 in the Data Protection Act applies to such processing. The European Court of Justice has judged that in order to take into account the importance of freedom of expression in democratic societies, the concepts associated with this, including journalism, must be interpreted in a broad sense. This means, among other things, that exceptions from and limitations of the data protection regulation should not only apply to media companies, but to everyone persons who are active in journalism. The practice of the European Court of Justice also shows that ""journalistic activity"" is such activity aimed at disseminating information, 45 opinions or ideas to the public, regardless of the medium through which this occurs. At the same time, the European Court of Justice has ruled that not all information that is made available on internet and which contains personal data is covered by the term ""journalistic Operation"". The European Court of Justice has further found in the judgment Google Spain and Google that a search engine provider's processing through the provision of the search engine could not considered to be for journalistic purposes. 47 In the ministerial memorandum Consequential changes to amended media fundamental laws, it was stated i.a. the following in the matter of search services with criminal convictions could be covered the concept of journalistic activity. ""With this assessment, it is difficult to imagine a situation where it the committee mentioned the typical case of a data collection that is hit by the exceptions i 44Bet. 2017/18:KU16, p. 41. 45 ECJ judgment Buivids, C-345/17, EU:C:2019:122, pp. 51–53. 46 ECJ judgment Buivids, C-345/17, EU:C:2019:122, p. 58. 47 ECJ judgment Google Spain and Google, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, p. 85. Data Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 22(28) Date: 2022-09-13 the Freedom of the Press Ordinance and the Freedom of Expression Act – one aimed at the general public pure search service regarding criminal convictions - with application of the The European Court of Justice indicated that the proportionality assessment would be considered to fail the journalist exception in the data protection act. This taking into account that the data quite obviously are very sensitive to privacy and then such a register cannot said to inform, exercise criticism and provoke debate on social issues of importance to the public. It would therefore go too far to claim that an exception from the protection of personal data in such a case is strictly necessary. That may also be considered to be the case the case of other sensitive personal data regarding, for example, ethnic background, sexual orientation or religious beliefs. As stated in section 5.2.2, it is also relevant for the search service in question contains editorial material. It would, however, be required that the connection between the personal data and the editorial feature appear clear and relevant so that the exception for journalistic activities can be invoked. Regarding the example of a private load register directed at the public is made the assessment that this cannot reasonably fall under the journalist exception simply because there are also independent articles and legal articles in connection with the register analyzes. Another arrangement would mean that privacy protection can easily circumvented in a way that cannot be considered responsive to the balanced assessment between the protection of privacy and freedom of expression as indicated by the European Court of Justice The Satakunnan goal.” 48 In the bill An appropriate protection for the freedom of the press and expression (prop. 2021/22:59, p. 54) the following was stated: ""Against that background, it is difficult to imagine a situation where one data collection provided in a constitutionally protected activity is exempt from constitutional protection due to the nature of the data collection but is covered by the data protection act's journalist exception. An assessment of every conceivable situation can although of course not generally done in advance. When the delegation provisions well are applicable, it may be determined in the usual way in the individual case which requirements in the data protection regulation that the provider of the data collection needs follow."" The Swedish Privacy Protection Authority's assessment The issue that IMY has to decide on is about the processing of personal data health that Verify performs by including rulings in psychiatry targets and LVM targets i The services are provided for journalistic purposes in the sense referred to in ch. 1. § 7 second 49 paragraph of the Data Protection Act and Article 85 of the Data Protection Ordinance. It can initially ascertained, in accordance with what appears from the operator's statements above, that the scope for assessing that a data collection covered by ch. 1 Section 20 YGL is done for journalistic purposes must be considered very limited. IMY further notes that the fact that a website contains certain publications with a journalistic purpose does not mean that all publications on it 50 the website must be considered to have a journalistic purpose. That in connection with a data collection with legal rulings there are independent articles and legal analyzes thus do not automatically mean that the entire data collection has one 48Ds 2017:57, p. 121. 49 For a more extensive review of the interpretation of the term ""journalistic purposes"", see IMYRS 2022:2, which is available here https://www.imy.se/globalassets/dokument/rattsligt-stallningstagande/imyrs-2022-2-undantaget- for-journalistic-andamal.pdf. 50 See NJA 2001 p. 409, Ds 2017:57, p. 121 and IMYRS 2022:2, pp. 25–27. Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 23(28) Date: 2022-09-13 journalistic purpose. It should be required that the connection between the personal data and that the editorial element appears to be clear and relevant because the exception for journalistic activity must be able to be invoked. It has not emerged in the case that it there is an editorial content with a clear and relevant connection to it in the case current part of the data collection with decisions in psychiatry cases and LVM cases. The investigation shows that the Services aim, among other things, to provide personal data for background checks of natural persons in connection with, for example recruitment. According to IMY's assessment, such processing of personal data cannot considered to have journalistic purposes. However, Verifiera has stated that the Services also have purposes other than background checks, e.g. research. As IMY notes above, it is data collection that Verify provides the result of an extensive collection of legal rulings with very privacy-sensitive information. The collection takes place without assessment of the relevance of the ruling for e.g. the general debate or investigative journalism. There is also no processing of the rulings, e.g. to remove direct personal data such as name and social security number. The result is one data collection in which it is possible to search for anyone who has been the subject of since 2008 compulsory care due to mental illness or substance abuse. This data collection cannot is considered to have the main purpose of disseminating information, opinions or ideas to the public in the manner referred to in ch. 1. Section 7 second paragraph of the Data Protection Act and Article 85 of the Data Protection Ordinance. For the purpose of Verify stated that the activity is necessary for the common man legitimate interest in obtaining access to public documents, there is reason to underline that the relationship that the public may have a legitimate interest in taking part in public documents in an easily accessible way does not in itself mean that Verifiera has one journalistic purpose with its treatment. The European Court of Justice stated in the judgment Google and Google Spain that the public could have a legitimate interest in participating information by searching a person's name in a search engine. At the same time beat the court held that the search engine provider could not invoke the exception for journalistic purposes when processing personal data in such searches. This applied according to the court even in cases where the search hit referred to a newspaper article and in itself had 52 journalistic purposes. According to IMY's assessment, the business Verifiera is located conducts through the relevant part of the data collection in the case, on the corresponding way as a search engine provider's business, outside of the journalistic exception purpose. In summary, IMY makes the assessment that the publication of rulings is verified in the target types in question are not covered by the exception in ch. 1. Section 7, second paragraph the data protection act. Verifiera is the personal data controller for the processing As can be seen above, IMY makes the assessment that the data protection regulation is applicable to processing in the Services. The personal data controller according to the data protection regulation is the person who alone or together with others determines the purposes and means for the processing of personal data (Article 4.7). 51 See IMYRS 2022:2, p. 23 f. 52 ECJ judgment Google Spain and Google, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, p. 81, 85 and 95. Data Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 24(28) Date: 2022-09-13 IMY states that it is Verifiera that provides the Services for financial consideration compensation to paying users. Furthermore, Verify has stated that it is Verify who decide on the purposes and means for the personal data processing of their service, let it be that Verifiera points out that ""in journalistic terms, it is the user who decides on the purposes, in the same way that a newspaper reader himself decides the target when this takes part in a published magazine, and not the newsroom which published the paper.” Against this background, IMY finds that Verifiera is the personal data controller for the personal data processing consisting of the provision of the Services and the data collection. The processing is contrary to Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation Applicable regulations As stated above, IMY makes the assessment that Verifiera processes sensitive data personal data consisting of information about health in the Services. According to Article 9.1 i data protection regulation, the processing of such data is generally prohibited. In order for the processing to be permitted, it is required that one of the exceptions specified in Article 9.2 of the Data Protection Regulation is applicable to the processing. According to Article 9.2 a of the data protection regulation, the prohibition in Article 9.1 shall not be applied the data subject has expressly consented to the processing. According to Article 9.2 g, the prohibition in Article 9.1 does not apply if the processing is necessary for consideration of an important public interest, on the basis of Union law or Member the national law of the states, which must be proportionate to the intended purpose, be consistent with the essential content of the right to data protection and contain provisions on appropriate and specific measures to ensure the registered fundamental rights and interests. Consent The collection of information that is the subject of IMY's review consists of a large number legal rulings in psychiatry and LVM cases. The data collection is used by Verify to provide the Services. One of these is called the background check service. Verifiera has argued that express consent, according to Article 9.2 a of the data protection regulation, exists for the part of the processing that relates to this service. IMY notes, however, that Verifiera obtains consent only in connection with a background check is ordered from Verify. Consent is thus only given after Verify performed the treatments to collect and arrange for searchability the decisions therein the sensitive personal data is processed. A consent that is obtained after the fact is not valid. There is therefore no reason to state about the express consent which Verifiera claims to collect otherwise meets the conditions of the data protection regulation. Article 9.2 g and freedom of expression and information Regarding the processing in general, Verifiera has claimed that the processing ""is necessary for purposes relating to Verified's legitimate interest in being able to operate its constitutionally protected activity within the framework of its certificate of issue"". According to Verify in the present case, the interests of the data subjects do not outweigh the right to freedom of speech. Finally, state Verify that the documents in the data collection exist available through the majority of other sources as well as what type of ruling applies should be uninteresting as courts have to apply confidentiality to the extent that information about health exists. The Swedish Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 25(28) Date: 2022-09-13 IMY initially states that legitimate interest (also called balancing of interests) is one of several legal bases according to Article 6.1 f of the Data Protection Regulation which is required for that the processing of personal data must be legal. However, this basis is not included in it enumeration of exceptions in Article 9.2 which can legitimize the treatment of such sensitive personal data referred to in Article 9.1 and which is now in question. Like that of course, Verify with the above stated that the exception in Article 9.2 g constitutes legal support for the processing. IMY notes that the public's freedom of expression and information is an important general principle interest. This is also expressed in Article 85 of the Data Protection Regulation which imposes an obligation on Member States to incorporate in law the right to privacy i in accordance with the data protection regulation with freedom of expression and information. According to Article 85(2) of the Data Protection Regulation, Member States may make exceptions to the provisions of, among other things, Article 9 if it is necessary to combine the right to integrity with freedom of expression and information. In Swedish law, this has taken place through 1 Cape. Section 7 of the Data Protection Act, which according to IMY's assessment in this decision is not applicable on the portion of Verifiera's data collection reviewed in this decision. The regulation in the data protection regulation can be interpreted as only Article 85 which, in accordance with the principle of lex specialis, must be used to regulate in national law the relationship between the right to protection of personal data and the right to expression and freedom of information. According to IMY, however, it cannot be ruled out that, in addition, it is possible to introduce national regulation of the kind referred to in Article 9.2 g of the data protection regulation to provide support for the processing of sensitive personal data that is necessary to cater for the public's freedom of expression and information. Such regulation would among other things need to contain provisions on appropriate and special measures to ensure the data subject's fundamental rights and interests. Someone like that however, regulation has not been introduced into Swedish law. There is thus no option for Verify to apply Article 9.2 g of the data protection regulation with reference to the public freedom of expression and information. Article 9.2 g and the principle of publicity Verifiera has also stated that the processing in the data collection is necessary for the common man's legitimate interest in that, within the framework of Verified constitutional protection, get access to public documents available in the Services. IMY therefore finds reasons to assess whether the rules on the publicity principle in ch. 2 TF can provide support for Verified treatment. The data protection regulation regulates the relationship between the right to protection for personal data and the principle of publicity in Article 86. It states that personal data i public documents kept by an authority, a public body or a private one body for carrying out a task of public interest may be disclosed by the authority or the body in accordance with the national law of the Member State to adjust combines the public's right to access public documents with the right to protection for personal data in accordance with the regulation. In ch. 1 Section 7 first paragraph the data protection act has also introduced regulations that make it clear that the data protection regulation shall not be applied to the extent that it would conflict with 53 the rules on public documents in ch. 2 TF. The provisions on the public record in ch. 2. TF gives everyone the right to take part of public documents that are not covered by confidentiality. For it to be a matter of 5 Prop. 2017/18:105, pp. 42–43. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 26(28) Date: 2022-09-13 a public document, the document must be kept with an authority or another body which is covered by the principle of publicity (Chapter 2, Sections 4 and 5 TF). The rules in ch. 2 TF thus does not give the public a right to take part in public documents released by an organization which, like Verify, is not subject to the obligation to disclose documents according to the principle of publicity. The rules in ch. 2 TF also does not give a right to the person who receives public documents to spread them further or further process them in another way. the purpose with the publicity principle, as expressed in ch. 2. § 1 TF, is admittedly that promote a free exchange of ideas, a free and comprehensive enlightenment and a free artistic creative. However, the further processing of disclosed public documents is covered not of the provisions in ch. 2. TF without other rules, especially other parts of the media fundamentals. The basic media laws give, among other things, the right to publish general information documents or information from such documents and to disseminate such publications (see, among other things, ch. 1 § 1 second paragraph and ch. 6 TF and ch. 3 YGL). It should be emphasized that the Swedish data protection regulation creates a large scope to further process personal data in public documents to satisfy it fundamental importance that freedom of press and expression has for the Swedish language state of affairs. This takes place through the exception for the basic media laws in ch. 1. Section 7 first paragraph of the Data Protection Act and the exception for, among other things, journalistic purposes in 1 Cape. Section 7, second paragraph of the Data Protection Act. As IMY notes in this decision, covered however, not the personal data processing of these exceptions in question. Against this background, IMY states that ch. 2 TF does not regulate Verified publication of sensitive personal data and therefore cannot constitute a basis according to 9.2 g of the data protection regulation for this processing. In addition, it can be stated that the rules in ch. 2 Nor does the TF contain any such appropriate and special measures to protect the rights of the data subjects in the further processing of released public data actions. Conclusions Since nothing has come to light to suggest that any other exception in Article 9.2 is applicable, IMY finds that Verify during the period 6 April 2022 – 28 June 2022 has processed sensitive personal data (data on health) in violation of Article 9 i the data protection regulation in its services at www.verifiera.se. Choice of intervention From article 58.2 i and article 83.2 of the data protection regulation it appears that IMY has power to impose administrative penalty charges in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, the administrative sanction fees are imposed in addition to or instead of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2), which for example injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83.2 states which factors which shall be taken into account when deciding whether administrative penalty charges shall be imposed and at determining the size of the fee. If it is a question of a minor violation, IMY gets as set out in recital 148 instead of imposing a penalty charge issue one reprimand according to article 58.2 b. Consideration must be given to aggravating and mitigating factors circumstances of the case, such as the nature, severity and duration of the infringement as well as previous violations of relevance. IMY has established that during the relevant period, Verifiera has carried out a comprehensive collection of sensitive personal data about a large number of people in the Services through the Swedish Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-1621 27(28) Date: 2022-09-13 to publish, among other things, 210,000 decisions from the administrative courts, of which approx 193,000 are psychiatric cases and approx. 18,000 are LVM cases. The goals contain a lot privacy-sensitive information regarding people who are or have been in a very vulnerable situation. The result is a collection of data on everyone who has been since 2008 subject to compulsory care due to mental illness or substance abuse. Of the investigation it further appears that the purpose of the data collection is, among other things, to provide background checks on recruitment. Processing of the current data on health i such contexts can lead to noticeable consequences for the registered, to example in the form of reduced opportunities to be considered for employment and exclusion. According to IMY, the violation of Article 9 found in this decision thus of such scope and degree of seriousness that it would normally cause a known penalty fee. In this supervisory case, however, there are special circumstances that militate against a sanction charge. It concerns the processing of personal data on a website that has a certificate of publication and as a starting point has constitutional protection according to the basic media laws. The limitation of the constitutional protection of data collections that make public sensitive personal data introduced in 2019 through ch. 1 Section 20 YGL has not previously been applied by IMY. The provision has also not, as far as can be seen, been applied by any court or any other authority. There is thus a lack of practice regarding how constitutional the provision - which in some respects requires relatively difficult considerations - shall be applied. In addition, until recently there has been indicative information on IMY's website which has been perceived as meaning that IMY has no opportunity to intervene against web pages with proof of publication. Overall, this means according to IMY's assessment that it would not be proportionate to impose Verify a penalty fee for the established violations in the current case. Verify AB must therefore, with the support of Article 58.2 b of the data protection regulation, instead a reprimand is given for it found the violation. The publication of the sensitive personal data means a serious breach of privacy for the persons concerned. Verified proof of issue does not allow any exception to the data protection regulation as long as the company continues to publish sensitive personal data in a data collection covered by ch. 1. 20 § YGL. It is important to ensure that this breach of privacy ends. IMY therefore assesses that there are grounds to order Verify according to Article 58.2 d i data protection regulation to take measures so that in the services that Verifiera offers on www.verifiera.se is no longer possible for users of the services to search on people with one of the search parameters personal name, social security number or address take part in decisions in cases under the Act on Compulsory Psychiatric Care or the Act on Care of drug addicts in certain cases concerning the wanted person. The actions must have taken no later than eight weeks after this decision became final. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This decision has been taken by the general manager Lena Lindgren Schelin after a presentation by the lawyer Martin Wetzler.

IMY has decided, pursuant to Articles 58.2 and 83 of the GDPR, that Apoteket AB shall pay an administrative fine of SEK 37,000,000. Account of the Supervision Case Background On 25 April 2022, Apoteket AB (hereinafter referred to as ""Apoteket"") submitted a report of a personal data breach to the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY). The report stated that Apoteket had used the analytics tool Metapixel from Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (formerly known as Facebook Pixel) on its website www.apoteket.se (the website) to enhance advertising targeting towards customers, thus allowing the transfer of data related to customers and website visitors to Meta, which was not intended to be transferred. Apoteket discovered the incident through information received from an external source. The breach report was preceded by media reports that Apoteket had transferred certain data about its customers’ online purchases to Meta. IMY initiated supervision in May 2022 based on the information contained in the breach report. The supervision was limited to the question of whether Apoteket had implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with Article 32 of the GDPR. What Apoteket has stated Responsibility for Personal Data Apoteket is responsible for the personal data processing regarding the implementation of Metapixel (formerly Facebook Pixel) and the transfer of data to Meta (formerly Facebook). Purpose of Processing Apoteket has used Metapixel since 2017 for marketing purposes. The primary goal was to measure the effectiveness of the company's marketing on Meta’s social media platforms, Facebook and Instagram. The secondary purpose was to market products to visitors who had viewed self-care product pages without making a purchase, to encourage them to buy later. The pixel was used for the secondary purpose to a limited extent and only during specific periods. On 19 January 2020, the automatic advanced matching (AAM) function of Metapixel was activated, leading to more data being processed than before. The activation of the AAM function was not necessary to fulfil the processing purposes. The activation of Metapixel and the AAM function was carried out by individual employees without prior risk assessment, contrary to Apoteket's procedures. Apoteket became aware that potentially sensitive data had been shared only after the media reported on it. Apoteket decided to immediately deactivate Metapixel and the AAM function on 25 April 2022 after becoming aware of the extent of the data transferred. Personal Data Transferred to Meta The data transfer to Meta was not the same for all customers and depended on the customer's actions on the website. Apoteket did not transfer data about customers who had declined marketing cookies. For customers who consented to marketing cookies, the following event data was generally transferred through Metapixel: URL Value (value of the product or total cart) Currency (e.g., ""SEK"") Content IDs (Product ID, Apoteket's internal product number) Content Type (e.g., ""Product"") IP address Since the activation of the AAM function, the following contact information was also transferred: First and last name Email address Phone number Personal identity number Gender City Postal code Country The contact information was only transferred during completed purchases and in hashed form, meaning Meta could only read the information if they had previously had the corresponding information. Meta then tried to match the transferred contact information with a Facebook user ID and subsequently deleted it. If a customer logged in to ""My Pages"" with mobile BankID, the personal identity number was transferred as it was interpreted as a phone number. Apoteket made a conscious decision not to transfer data about prescription drugs. This exclusion was achieved by not including Metapixel on the part of the website where a customer could add a prescription drug to the cart. Additionally, order lines containing prescription drugs were filtered out at the time of purchase from the product data by Apoteket's server before being transferred to Meta. If a visitor accepted marketing cookies and completed a purchase, data on the following products and/or product categories were shared via Metapixel with the AAM function activated: a) Self-tests and treatments for sexually transmitted diseases b) Contraceptives and morning-after pills c) Sex toys d) Products for vaginal health (e.g., dry mucous membranes, menopause symptoms, and yeast infections) e) Products for prostate issues and urination problems f) Pregnancy tests, ovulation tests, and pregnancy products g) Products for the treatment of fungus (e.g., athlete's foot or nail fungus) h) Products for the treatment and control of diabetes i) Products for the treatment of rectal issues (e.g., anal fissures and haemorrhoids) j) Products for the treatment of gastrointestinal problems (e.g., IBS, constipation, and diarrhoea) k) Products for the treatment of migraines l) Products for the treatment of allergies m) Hearing aid accessories n) Products for the treatment of bacterial infections o) Products for the treatment of psoriasis p) Products for the treatment of rosacea q) Stoma products Meta is fundamentally an authorised recipient, and not all data transfers of website visitors' information have been impermissible. The personal data breach concerns the potential transfer of sensitive personal data. However, not all products in Apoteket's range can be considered to provide information about a person's health or sex life, only products from a so-called privacy-sensitive range in combination with direct personal data. A person's actions on the website also do not necessarily indicate anything about their health or sex life until the customer adds a privacy-sensitive product to the cart or completes a purchase of such a product. However, it is not clear that this necessarily says anything about the individual customer, as many buy products for others, for preventive purposes, or for a ""home pharmacy."" Additionally, the self-care products sold by Apoteket do not necessarily belong to the so-called privacy-sensitive range. The legal situation is unclear, making it difficult to categorically state that sensitive personal data has been transferred. If the transfer of sensitive personal data has occurred, it was not Apoteket's intention. However, Apoteket has a data processing agreement with Meta, and it is not a case of an unknown recipient of the data. The transfer has not occurred in an uncontrolled manner in the sense that unauthorised individuals accessed the information through a malicious hacker attack. The actual risk to the data subjects is therefore assessed as moderate. The transfer of personal identity numbers has not increased the risk to the data subjects since the data was transferred in a hashed form, using SHA256, and then deleted by Meta as the data could not be matched. The primary issue is that the data subjects have, to some extent, lost control over their personal data, but Apoteket's actions did not increase the risk to the data subjects. It should be considered mitigating that Meta has had an active signal filtering mechanism that filtered out sensitive data. Thus, the information has not been shared further or used by Apoteket or Meta. The harm to the data subjects is therefore limited. Extent of the Incident At the time of the report, the incident was estimated to have affected 500,001–1,000,000 data subjects. Apoteket has since stated that it is not possible to provide an exact number of data subjects affected by the event, partly because it does not involve a leak from a register or database that Apoteket had full control and oversight of, and because data transfer occurred directly between the user's browser and Meta. The group of potentially affected data subjects is influenced by several factors. The maximum number of affected individuals is 930,000. This estimate is based on the number of online purchases during the relevant period, considering that a certain proportion of purchases are made by returning customers and customers using ad blockers or who have declined cookies. Apoteket's view is that the incident only involves completed purchases and not data on individuals who clicked on products, added products to their cart, or started the payment process. Nine per cent of the total online sales during the relevant period of the incident consisted of products from the categories listed above in points a–q. Regarding the quantity of transferred personal data, Apoteket has noted that the number of unique products per purchase during the period was 1.41 products per customer. However, when assessing how many sensitive personal data items have been transferred, it must be considered that some purchases included self-care products (which do not reveal health information), were made for others, or involved multiple packages of the same product. Technical and Organisational Security Before the incident, Apoteket had proactive processes in place to ensure the correct handling of personal data, including comprehensive risk assessments and reviews by the Data Protection Officer regarding personal data issues. Apoteket's development process includes several control points to identify risks and ensure correct personal data processing. These control points include reviewing new solutions or features on the website from an information security and data protection perspective (through an information analysis), an architectural perspective, and a contractual perspective (if the solution is purchased), as well as code reviews before the solution is deployed on the website. Apoteket also conducts audits and penetration tests of the website to detect and address vulnerabilities. In this case, Apoteket’s established IT development and risk assessment procedures were not followed by individual employees. A possible reason, which is not a justification, could be that the functionality was very easy to activate without significant development effort. At the time of activating the AAM function, administrative privileges in the Meta Business Manager tool were required, which two professional roles, comprising a total of three people, had. According to routine, privileges to the Meta Business Manager tool, including the AAM function, are regularly reviewed and controlled to ensure that only those who need access have it. However, no other desired routines for review and follow-up were established due to the activation of the pixel and AAM function not following Apoteket’s usual procedures. After deactivating Metapixel and the AAM function, Apoteket had a dialogue with Meta about data deletion. Meta stated that data older than two years had already been deleted but that the company could not manually delete data from the last two years. Apoteket provided general information to the data subjects about the incident, which was published on the website at the end of April and in May 2022. To address specific questions and answers from customers, informational materials were provided to Apoteket employees. Apoteket has also taken measures to reduce the risk of similar incidents in the long term. The company conducted an inventory and analysis of cookies and analytics tools on the website, introduced a role with overall responsibility for the marketing department to ensure compliance with rules and guidelines, and improved its information security governance model. Employees already completed annual e-learning in security, including a chapter on data protection and information security. To further raise awareness after the incident, short e-learning courses on IT and information security were introduced. Choice of Corrective Measure Apoteket has transferred data to Meta that should not have been shared. However, the harm has been limited. The violation has not affected the core fulfilment of Apoteket’s obligations under Article 32 of the GDPR. Apoteket promptly reported the violation to IMY and took the possible measures to mitigate the consequences of the violation. These circumstances, combined with the fact that the violation occurred due to negligence, indicate that it is a minor violation, and a reprimand is therefore sufficient. Regarding the seriousness of the violation, it has only slightly hindered the effective application of Article 32 of the GDPR. Furthermore, the violation occurred within a business activity, and the nature of the processing has therefore not involved any particular risks. There was also no dependency relationship between the data subjects and Apoteket. The processing was carried out for marketing purposes, which is not part of Apoteket's core business, which is to provide prescription and over-the-counter medicines. The personal data breach has indeed affected a relatively large number of data subjects, but the level of harm caused by the violation is low. The violation should at most be considered of medium severity. There are reasons to consider how turnover is calculated in other EU legal areas, primarily competition law. This is because the majority of Apoteket's turnover comes from other parts of Apoteket's business, such as traditional retail trade and healthcare and dose business, than the area where the violation occurred. According to the European Commission's Guidelines on the calculation of fines imposed under Article 23.2 a of Regulation No 1/2003, the base amount for calculation should be determined by considering the value of sales for the goods or services directly or indirectly related to the violation and which the company sold in the relevant geographic area within the EEA. Analogously, the part of Apoteket's turnover related to the business area where the violation occurred should be considered, that is, the turnover related to online sales of over-the-counter medicines, self-care products, hygiene articles, and skincare. There are several mitigating factors regarding the violation, including the measures Apoteket has taken to mitigate the consequences for the data subjects, that Apoteket has fully cooperated with IMY, and that data was filtered out and thus not reached Meta for further processing. Apoteket also reported the incident on its initiative to IMY. Since economic gain from the violation can be seen as an aggravating factor in calculating the fine, Apoteket wants to clarify that the increase in sales that can possibly be linked to the use of the AAM function is negligible. Reasoning of the Decision IMY must first determine whether the GDPR applies and whether IMY is the competent supervisory authority. If so, IMY must consider whether Apoteket is the data controller and whether the company has implemented appropriate security measures under Article 32 of the GDPR to protect the personal data processed through Metapixel, with the AAM function activated, during the period from 19 January 2020 to 25 April 2022. IMY’s Competence Applicable Provisions Article 95 of the GDPR states that the regulation should not impose additional obligations on natural or legal persons who process personal data for areas already covered by obligations under the so-called ePrivacy Directive. The ePrivacy Directive has been implemented into Swedish law through the Electronic Communications Act (2003:389) (LEK), which regulates, among other things, the collection of data through cookies. According to Chapter 9, Section 28 of the LEK, which implements Article 5.3 of the ePrivacy Directive, data may only be stored in or retrieved from a subscriber's or user's terminal equipment if the subscriber or user has access to information about the purpose of the processing and consents to it. It also states that this does not prevent storage or access necessary to transmit an electronic message via an electronic communications network or is necessary to provide a service that the user or subscriber has expressly requested. The LEK entered into force on 22 August 2022. However, during the relevant time in this case, the same requirements applied under Chapter 6, Section 18 of the Electronic Communications Act (2003:389). The Swedish Post and Telecom Authority (PTS) is the supervisory authority under the LEK. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has expressed its views on the interaction between the ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR. The opinion states that the national supervisory authority appointed under the ePrivacy Directive is solely competent to monitor compliance with the Directive. However, IMY is the competent supervisory authority under the GDPR for processing not specifically regulated by the ePrivacy Directive. IMY's Assessment IMY's review focuses on a situation where data subjects have used a service on Apoteket's website to order a product and have voluntarily provided the information captured by Metapixel. This data processing does not involve storing or retrieving data from a subscriber's or user's terminal equipment and is thus not covered by Chapter 9, Section 28 of the LEK or the previous corresponding provision in the Electronic Communications Act. This means that the GDPR's regulation applies to the personal data processing in question and that IMY is the competent supervisory authority. Furthermore, IMY's review concerns whether Apoteket has implemented adequate security measures, which is not specifically regulated in the LEK. Therefore, IMY is competent to investigate the issue covered by the supervision case. Responsibility for Personal Data Applicable Provisions A data controller, according to Article 4.7 of the GDPR, is the entity that alone or together with others determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. The fact that the purposes and means can be determined by more than one entity means that several entities can be data controllers for the same processing. The data controller must ensure and be able to demonstrate that the principles in Article 5.1 are complied with, as stated in Article 5.2 of the GDPR (the accountability principle). IMY's Assessment Apoteket has stated that it is the data controller for the implementation of Metapixel and the transfer of data to Meta. The investigation in the case shows that Apoteket implemented Metapixel, a script-based tool in the form of a piece of code that records visitors' actions and transfers the information to Meta on its website, and subsequently activated the AAM function. The purpose of Metapixel was to increase the effectiveness of the company's marketing and, to some extent, target ads at previous visitors to the website. Apoteket has therefore determined how the processing should be conducted and for what purpose the personal data should be processed. IMY therefore assesses that Apoteket is the data controller for the processing of personal data carried out through the use of Metapixel with the AAM function activated. Has Apoteket Ensured an Appropriate Level of Security for the Personal Data? Applicable Provisions The Requirement to Implement Appropriate Safeguards Article 32.1 of the GDPR requires the data controller to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing. This must be done considering the state of the art, the implementation costs, and the nature, scope, context, and purpose of the processing, as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. According to the same provision, appropriate safeguards, where appropriate, include: a) Pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data, b) The ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services, c) The ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident, and d) A process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of processing. In assessing the appropriate level of security, specific consideration must be given to the risks posed by processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed, as stated in Article 32.2. Recital 75 of the GDPR specifies factors to be considered when assessing the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Among other things, it mentions the loss of confidentiality concerning personal data that is subject to professional secrecy and whether the processing involves data concerning health or sexual life. It should also be considered if the processing concerns personal data of vulnerable natural persons, especially children, or if the processing involves a large amount of personal data concerning many data subjects. Recital 76 of the GDPR states that the likelihood and severity of the risk to the data subjects' rights and freedoms should be determined based on the nature, scope, context, and purpose of the processing. The risk should be evaluated based on an objective assessment, determining whether the data processing involves a risk or a high risk. Processing of Sensitive Personal Data Data concerning health and sexual life constitutes special categories of personal data, so-called sensitive personal data, which is afforded particularly strong protection under the GDPR. As a general rule, processing such personal data is prohibited under Article 9.1 of the GDPR unless the processing falls under one of the exceptions in Article 9.2 of the Regulation. Health data is defined in Article 4.15 of the GDPR as personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, providing information about their health status. Recital 35 of the GDPR states that health data should include all data related to a data subject's health condition, providing information about the data subject's past, present, or future physical or mental health status. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the Lindqvist case ruled that information that a person has injured their foot and is on part-time sick leave constitutes personal data concerning health under the Data Protection Directive (which was repealed by the GDPR). The CJEU stated that considering the purpose of the Data Protection Directive, the term ""data concerning health"" should be interpreted broadly and should include information related to all aspects of a person's health, both physical and mental. In the subsequent case, Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisija, the CJEU concluded that the term sensitive personal data under Article 9.1 of the GDPR should be interpreted broadly and determined that even personal data that indirectly, after intellectual reasoning or cross-referencing, reveals a natural person's sexual orientation constitutes sensitive personal data under the relevant provision. IMY’s Assessment The Processing Involved a High Risk and Required a High Level of Protection The data controller must implement measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risks of processing. The assessment of the appropriate level of protection should consider, among other things, the nature, scope, context, and purpose of the processing, as well as the risks, of varying likelihood and severity, to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. IMY must first determine what personal data Apoteket has transferred to Meta through Metapixel with the AAM function activated. The investigation in the case shows that the activation of Metapixel's AAM function has resulted in Apoteket, provided a customer has accepted marketing cookies and not used an ad blocker, transferring information about completed purchases to Meta. The information transferred included data about purchased products (including the URL of the products on the website, product ID, and product type) and customer contact information (including first and last name, address, and phone number). The data transferred to Meta did not include prescription products but did include the following products and product categories: a) Self-tests and treatments for sexually transmitted diseases b) Contraceptives and morning-after pills c) Sex toys d) Products for vaginal health (e.g., dry mucous membranes, menopause symptoms, and yeast infections) e) Products for prostate issues and urination problems f) Pregnancy tests, ovulation tests, and pregnancy products g) Products for the treatment of fungus (e.g., athlete's foot or nail fungus) h) Products for the treatment and control of diabetes i) Products for the treatment of rectal issues (e.g., anal fissures and haemorrhoids) j) Products for the treatment of gastrointestinal problems (e.g., IBS, constipation, and diarrhoea) k) Products for the treatment of migraines l) Products for the treatment of allergies m) Hearing aid accessories n) Products for the treatment of bacterial infections o) Products for the treatment of psoriasis p) Products for the treatment of rosacea q) Stoma products It has emerged in the case that Meta has implemented a so-called filtering mechanism designed to detect and delete information transferred to Meta in violation of the company's policy. IMY has therefore requested information from Meta on how the filtering mechanism works. According to Meta's statement on 16 February 2024, the mechanism is designed to detect and delete potentially unauthorised information, such as health and financial data, in data users of the pixel transfer to Meta before it is stored and used in Meta's advertising system. When such data is detected and deleted, the user is notified, but the filtering mechanism operates even if no such notification is sent to the user. Based on this, IMY concludes that the pixel does not inherently contain a filtering mechanism that prevents data transfer to Meta. The filtering mechanism is designed to filter out potentially privacy-sensitive data only after it has been transferred to Meta and if Meta's system has identified that the transferred data contains such unauthorised information. The absence of notifications about unauthorised and deleted information cannot be considered confirmation that potentially privacy-sensitive data has not been transferred to Meta. The presence of the filtering function has, in summary, not prevented the confirmed transfer of personal data to Meta. IMY makes the following assessment of the risks associated with the current data processing. Processing involving sensitive personal data typically involves higher risks. The term sensitive personal data should be interpreted broadly and includes data that indirectly reveals such information. Apoteket has transferred data to Meta about which product a customer has purchased and data that identifies the customer, such as name, address, and phone number. IMY considers that the combination of data transferred to Meta has made it possible to determine that a specific person has purchased a specific product. Apoteket has not transferred data about prescription products. However, many products in Apoteket's other range (see points a–q above) are such that information about a person purchasing them could reveal details about their health condition or sexual life. Apoteket has argued that the buyer is not necessarily the actual user of the product, and it is difficult to categorically state that sensitive personal data has been transferred. However, IMY considers that it is likely that at least some of the purchases of, for example, stoma products, products for rectal, urinary, and prostate issues, vaginal issues, and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes have been made for personal use to treat a specific health condition. IMY therefore considers it likely that the processing has involved health data as defined in Article 4.15 of the GDPR. IMY makes the same assessment regarding purchases of, for example, morning-after pills and sex toys, i.e., it is likely that purchases in at least some cases were made for personal use and that the processing therefore revealed information about the individual's sexual life. When assessing the appropriate level of protection, Apoteket should therefore have considered that the processing might involve sensitive personal data. IMY also considers that data on purchases of the specified products in points a–q, regardless of whether the data constitutes sensitive personal data or not, is of such a privacy-sensitive nature that it requires strong protection under the GDPR. It has also emerged that Apoteket in some cases has transferred other sensitive personal data in the form of personal identity numbers. Furthermore, the processing was carried out by a pharmacy where customers are assumed to have specific expectations that their personal data is handled with a high degree of confidentiality. IMY therefore concludes that both the nature of the personal data and the context in which it was processed have increased the risks to the data subjects' rights and freedoms. IMY also notes that the processing was extensive. Apoteket had many customers during the period when Metapixel's AAM function was activated, and the company estimates that up to 930,000 people were affected by the incident. This estimate is based on the number of online purchases during the relevant period, considering that a certain percentage of purchases were made by returning customers and individuals using ad blockers or who declined cookies. Apoteket has also stated that 9 per cent of the total online purchases made during the period involved the privacy-sensitive products listed in points a–q. Although it is impossible to determine precisely how many of these purchases were made by data subjects who did not use ad blockers or decline marketing cookies, it can at least be concluded that the incident affected a large number of data subjects. In summary, IMY assesses that the processing, given its nature, scope, and context, involved high risks that required a high level of protection for the personal data. The measures should have ensured, among other things, that the personal data was protected against unauthorised disclosure and loss of control. Apoteket Has Not Implemented Sufficient Security Measures IMY must then assess whether Apoteket has ensured the high level of protection required for personal data. Apoteket has stated that the company had proactive processes in place before the incident to ensure the correct handling of personal data. In this case, however, established IT development and risk assessment procedures, including reviewing and updating information analyses for all changes to systems and tools, were not followed by individual employees. The investigation shows that Apoteket did not analyse the risks and consequences of the personal data processing involved in the implementation of Metapixel and the activation of the AAM function before the processing began. Apoteket also did not select and categorise which products would be processed. This led to the absence of a technical limitation on which data would be processed, beyond the exclusion of prescription products, and that privacy-sensitive data about purchases of over-the-counter medicines and medical devices was transferred to Meta. A fundamental requirement for Apoteket to fulfil its obligations under the GDPR is that the company is aware of the processing under its responsibility. Apoteket, from 19 January 2020, when the AAM function was activated, until 25 April 2022, when Metapixel was removed, transferred more data to Meta than intended without detecting it themselves. Apoteket has stated that the activation of Metapixel's AAM function did not follow Apoteket's standard procedures, and no desired routines for review and follow-up were established. Since Apoteket only had routines to follow up on documented changes made according to set procedures, Apoteket lacked the ability to detect and address other changes that had been made or occurred otherwise. IMY, therefore, concludes that Apoteket lacked organisational procedures for systematically following up on unintentional changes in its systems. IMY thus assesses that Apoteket, even considering what has been stated about the procedures in place at the time of the violation, cannot be considered to have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures in relation to the high risks involved in the processing. Apoteket has therefore processed personal data in violation of Article 32.1 of the GDPR. Choice of Sanctions Applicable Provisions, etc. In the event of violations of the GDPR, IMY has several corrective powers at its disposal under Article 58.2 of the GDPR. Article 58.2 of the GDPR states that IMY shall impose administrative fines in addition to or instead of other corrective measures referred to in Article 58.2, depending on the circumstances of each case. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines is, in each case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive, as stated in Article 83.1 of the GDPR. Article 83.2 lists the factors to be considered when determining whether an administrative fine should be imposed and what should influence the amount of the fine. Relevant to the assessment of the severity of the violation is its nature, gravity, and duration. The EDPB has adopted guidelines on calculating administrative fines under the GDPR, which aim to create a harmonised method and principles for calculating fines. According to Article 83.4, administrative fines of up to 10,000,000 EUR, or, in the case of a company, up to 2 per cent of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, shall be imposed for violations of, among other things, Article 32. If the violation is minor, IMY may, according to Recital 148, issue a reprimand under Article 58.2(b) of the Regulation instead of imposing a fine. IMY’s Assessment A Fine Should be Imposed IMY has assessed that Apoteket processed personal data in violation of Article 32.1 of the GDPR. The violation occurred because Apoteket processed personal data with an insufficient level of security, resulting in personal data of a privacy-sensitive and protected nature concerning a large number of data subjects being inadvertently transferred to Meta. Unauthorised access to this type of data poses a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. The transfer continued for an extended period and was not detected and addressed until Apoteket was informed of the issue by an external party. IMY considers that this is not a minor violation that could result in a reprimand instead of a fine. The CJEU has clarified that for administrative fines to be imposed under the GDPR, the data controller must have committed a violation intentionally or negligently. The CJEU has stated that data controllers can be fined for actions if they could not be considered ignorant that the action constituted a violation, regardless of whether they were aware they were breaching the GDPR provisions. According to the accountability principle expressed in Article 5.2 of the GDPR, the data controller must ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing complies with the GDPR. IMY, therefore, concludes that Apoteket is responsible for ensuring that the personal data processed within the company is processed in a manner that ensures an appropriate level of security. IMY has, in its assessment, determined that Apoteket has not met the requirements set out in the GDPR in this regard. Apoteket cannot be considered ignorant that its actions constituted a violation of the Regulation. IMY therefore assesses that the conditions for imposing an administrative fine on Apoteket for the violations are met. When determining the size of the fine, IMY shall consider the circumstances listed in Article 83.2 and ensure that the fine is effective, proportionate, and dissuasive. Basis for Calculating the Fine IMY assesses that Apoteket’s annual turnover should form the basis for calculating the administrative fines in this case. The maximum fine applicable to companies for violations of Article 32 amounts to the higher of 10,000,000 EUR or 2 per cent of the total worldwide annual turnover of the previous financial year. According to Apoteket's annual report for 2023, the annual turnover for that year was SEK 23,270,000,000. The maximum fine that can be imposed in this case is therefore 2 per cent of that amount, which is SEK 465,400,000. IMY notes that there is no legal basis in the applicable legislation to calculate the fine based on another amount, as Apoteket suggested is done under other EU legislation. Severity of the Violation According to the EDPB’s guidelines, the supervisory authority should assess whether the violation is of low, medium, or high severity according to Article 83.2(a), (b), and (g) of the GDPR. The current violation affected a large number of data subjects and continued for an extended period. The data transferred included personal identity numbers and data indicating that directly identifiable individuals had purchased privacy-sensitive products. The unauthorised transfer has therefore posed a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in the form of a risk of loss of confidentiality for protected information. Furthermore, the violation occurred in a pharmacy business where data subjects must be assumed to have had a legitimate expectation of high confidentiality and that their personal data would not be disclosed to unauthorised parties. The sale of over-the-counter and other health-related products must also be considered part of Apoteket’s core business, which makes the violation more serious than if this had not been the case. In assessing the severity of the violation, IMY also considers that Apoteket had implemented several appropriate technical and organisational security measures at the time of the violation. Furthermore, the personal data was transferred in hashed, i.e., unreadable, format to a single recipient, and therefore it was not an uncontrolled disclosure where the data, for example, was shared with many unauthorised parties or made publicly available on the web. Considering the above circumstances, IMY assesses that this is a violation of Article 32.1 of the GDPR of low severity. IMY must also consider any aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Article 83.2 of the GDPR when determining the amount of the fine. Following the violation, Apoteket has had a dialogue with Meta about deletion, provided information to the data subjects, and taken measures to reduce the risk of similar incidents in the long term. However, IMY notes that these measures were only taken after Apoteket was alerted to the existing deficiencies by an external party and that they cannot be considered to exceed what is expected of Apoteket in this case. Therefore, the measures taken do not affect IMY's assessment of the fine amount in a mitigating direction. The same applies to the fact that Apoteket submitted a report of the personal data breach and cooperated with IMY in investigating the violation, as these are circumstances that should be considered neutral when determining the fine amount. IMY notes that no other circumstances affect IMY's assessment of the fine amount in an aggravating or mitigating direction. The Fine Must be Effective, Proportionate, and Dissuading The administrative fine must be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive. This means that the amount should be set so that the administrative fine leads to correction, provides a preventive effect, and is also proportionate in relation to both the current violation and the supervised entity’s financial capacity. IMY determines, based on an overall assessment, that Apoteket shall pay an administrative fine of SEK 37,000,000. IMY assesses that this amount is effective, proportionate, and dissuasive. This decision has been made by the acting Director General David Törngren after a presentation by the lawyer Maja Welander. The final handling also involved the acting Chief Legal Officer Cecilia Agnehall, the Head of Unit Nidia Nordenström, the lawyer Shirin Daneshgari Nejad, and the IT and information security specialist Petter Flink.

The Swedish Privacy Protection Authority gives MAG Interactive AB a reprimand according to article 58.2 b the data protection regulation for the established violation. Account of the supervisory matter Handling The Swedish Privacy Protection Authority (IMY) has started supervision of MAG Interactive AB (the company) due to a complaint, mainly to investigate whether the company has taken received and handled the complainant's request for deletion in a correct manner, i.a. if the company had reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of the complainant and in such cases whether they information requested by the complainant has been necessary to confirm the complainant identity and whether the company has facilitated the exercise of the complainant's rights i sufficient extent (Articles 11, 12 and 17 of the Data Protection Regulation). Mailing address: Box 8114 The complaints have been handed over to IMY, in its capacity as the responsible supervisory authority according to 104 20 Stockholm article 56 of the data protection regulation. The handover has taken place from the supervisory authority Website: www.imy.se E-mail: imy@imy.se 1 REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of Telephone: natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free flow of such data and on 08-657 61 00 repeal of Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-9109 2(12) Date: 2023-05-22 in the country where the complainant has filed his complaint (France) in accordance with the regulation's provisions on cooperation in cross-border processing. The proceedings at IMY have taken place through an exchange of letters. Against the background that it applies cross-border treatment, IMY has used the mechanisms for cooperation and uniformity found in Chapter VII of the Data Protection Regulation. Affected supervisory authorities have been the data protection authorities of Denmark, France, Ireland, Norway, Poland, Germany and Austria. The complaint The complaint essentially states the following. On January 31, 2021, the complainant requested the deletion of his personal data in the game QuizDuel, a game the appellant used through his Facebook account. The company then has requested additional information from the appellant for identification purposes despite the fact that the appellant in his request for deletion stated their Facebook ID and email addresses. To the complaint the appellant has attached email correspondence between the appellant and the company of which the following i.a. appears. On February 28, 2021, the company replied to the complainant that they have not ability to locate the complainant's account using the complainant's Facebook ID and that the appellant needs to open any of the MAG Interactive games to make one request. The complainant has replied to this that he no longer has a MAG Interactive account. On 11 March 2021, the company has i.a. requested the following information from the appellant i purpose of restoring the complainant's account and thus enabling the complainant to request deletion of their personal data: username, name of three friends, name of three opponent and an email address to which he wants to connect the account. What the company has stated In statements from November 4 and 7, 2022, the company essentially stated the following. Description of the course of events surrounding the handling of the complainant's request for deletion On January 31, 2021, the complainant contacted one of the company's support email addresses and provided a Facebook ID and three email addresses and requested to be deleted. At this one time, given the information the support received, the company did not receive any direct hits typing in the company's system, neither on Facebook ID nor on any of the specified the email addresses. The company's support responded on February 1, 2021 with instructions for how the complainant can request deletion from the game. The appellant contacted us again on the 8th February 2021 and said that he does not have the game left but wants to delete his data. The On February 9, the company's support replied that the easiest way is to download the game again and request deletion from within the game. On February 12, 2021, the appellant responded and announced that she instead wanted to know what information the company has about her. From this time the case was handled by the company as a request for access. On February 13, 2021, the company's support responded that the complainant can request access from the game. The complainant contacted again on 20 February 2021 and had problems to use their Facebook account. The complainant asked again if the company can find him account with his Facebook ID. On February 23, 2021, support replied that they did not find any account with the Facebook ID the complainant specified but that he should be able to start any of the company's games and request the personal data from within a game. On February 27, 2021, the complainant asked if the company had really tried to search for him Facebook ID. Support replied again on February 28, 2021 that they cannot find him account on the Facebook ID she entered, but that she should be able to start any Date: 2023-05-22 of their game and request access from within the game. On March 4, 2021, the appellant responded that he played ""QuizDuel"" on Facebook and does not have an account with MAG Interactive. She cannot therefore request access from there. This was probably a misunderstanding then the game was never on Facebook but he may have logged in via a Facebook button originally which was possible several years ago. It was the first time the appellant mentioned which game it was for which made it much easier to look for them tasks. On March 11, 2021, support replied that they cannot find the complainant's account through his Facebook ID but that they will try to help him get into his account so that he can request access or delete their account. The support had then probably managed to locate one account linked to one of the complainant's provided email addresses using the information about the game. Support then sent the standard questions the company asks when they are supposed to help users log into their account if they have forgotten their credentials. The complainant never responded to that email and when enough time passed the company closed the case. On October 30, 2022, after the company's CTO received the case, the CTO located an account who could be connected to the complainant and emailed the complainant for confirmation that the account should be deleted. On November 6, 2022, the appellant responded and confirmed that he owns the account and that the account should be deleted. November 7, 2022 was deleted the complainant's account and the complainant was informed about it. The company's processing of the complainant's personal data at the time of the complainant's request At the time of the complainant's request for deletion, the company was processing an email address which is linked to the complainant and probably the advertisingId/vendorId from their phone, the complainant's username and password. Otherwise, the company did not process any others of the complainant's personal data as any chat history and ip number are deleted long ago due to the company's retention policy. Why the company claims to have had reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of the complainant The complainant provided in his deletion request a Facebook ID and three email addresses and wrote that he used one of the company's apps on Facebook. The company's games are played on not on Facebook but on mobile phones and he did not specify nor any surrounding information such as username, which game it was or even that it was a game. The game which the appellant, according to later information, had played is so old that you didn't get any hits on the other email addresses either. Because the game to which the complainant's user account has been linked for a long time is also closed makes it difficult to find with email address alone. Email addresses are public and one providing an email address is therefore not proof of ownership. The email address that the request came from was also not linked to any account with the company and neither the Facebook ID entered. Regarding the other two email addresses, there was nothing proof that it is the complainant's email addresses. The Facebook ID the complainant provided is not registered with the company. Facebook has since many years stopped using global user numbers for privacy reasons. In the service of the company shut down many years ago where you could log in via your Facebook account the company does not see the same number as the complainant indicates. The customer number the company received from the Swedish Data Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-9109 4(12) Date: 2023-05-22 Facebook is only connected to the company and cannot be linked to a person by the company Facebook account. Given the knowledge of which game it was about that the company eventually got, had managed to find the account to which one email address was linked. The company then had was able to send an email to that email address in order to confirm the complainant's identity. The however, had played no role in this case when the case was changed on 13 February 2021 to an access request. How the complainant would go about requesting erasure and subsequent access Support initially suggested that the complainant request deletion directly from the game because it is the easiest and safest way. It is normal for users to have the game remains on the phone. In addition, the company's game helps with a reinstallation the user to get back to the correct account. When support has difficulty finding an account with the user's data it is therefore reasonable that they suggest a reinstallation to get to the right account. Support can also delete information directly about ownership the information can be substantiated. In the current case, the case turned to a request for access and then the company normally wants the user to be logged into their account. The company has stated that, just as for requests for deletion, proof is required ownership of the account to request access, this for privacy reasons and in accordance with the data protection regulation. Since user data may contain chat logs is the handling of access requests a little more strict than when handling a request for deletion of user data. The company therefore requires that the request be made from within player's account. Information that has been requested for the purpose of confirming identity The game the appellant had played was a game with user accounts. In game with user accounts often have chats for players to talk to each other. Of for privacy reasons, it is important that anyone cannot read anyone else's chats. The accounts are therefore password protected. Users can enter an email address for password reset but not all users do it or they have changed their email address. One issue all online services grapple with is how to handle the cases where users forgot the login details and it is not possible to restore the account via email. A part uses security questions, where users are allowed to fill in the name of their first pet or similar. In the company's case, it is a bit more complicated, as the company partly does not want to ask the users about more information than absolutely necessary, partly the game has that the current case was about a user base built up since 2012 with 100 million users who have not entered any such information. When users have forgotten If the login details and the account cannot be restored via email, the company resolves it in that the games make use of information on the phone and the operating system for to help users back to the account which is why the support sometimes asking users to install the game, which also appears to have been done by support in this case. When it doesn't work or as in this case when the user doesn't want the support asks as a last resort about information the player should know and should be easy for one user to remember but difficult for others to know. This one information is requested so that the company can ensure that it is the account holder to whom they grant access to the account. The information that support requests in such cases is as follows: The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-9109 5(12) Date: 2023-05-22 - The registrant's username. A task that is assumed to be easy for most people to answer. However, it is also a task that is relatively easy for others to figure out. - Usernames of three of the registrant's in-game friends. Most people who play this game have some friends they have played with for years. The the task should also be easy to answer. - Usernames of three of the registrant's opponents in the game. This task is often a bit more difficult to provide but for users who mostly playing against random players and not adding friends is one required task. Support also asked which email address the user wanted to link the account to. This is so that the complainant can log in and request their user data from within the game. The data must normally be provided by email in the ongoing support dialogue. The is not a requirement that one is right on all questions, but an assessment is made based on how right/wrong the answer is. The company also does not ask for personally identifiable information but only about usernames which are normally anonymous/pseudonymous and which already can be found in the company's register. The only data that is personally identifiable information is the email address the user wants to connect to the account. If the user can answer that well that the company deems that the user actually owns the account, the support sets the email address for recovery. The user can then set a new password and log in. The company is continuously working on improving its support tools and will be coming soon release a new version where this particular scenario can be handled and which should make it easier for support to find users even with very limited information. The support have instructions to delete the user's account directly about the email address on the account matches the user's email address and otherwise help the user take delete the account through the game. In this case, you can think of a third solution, that the company sends an email out a link to the linked account and that the user confirms deletion via the link to verify their identity. The company intends to add such an option. The complainant's account has been deleted The appellant's request for erasure has now been granted. The company has emailed the complainant on 30 October 2022 both at the email address he used in the support matter and the email address they found when searching. The company's CTO has asked the appellant to reply from that email address. Answer received from the appellant on November 6, 2022 with a confirmation that the appellant owns the account. The company's CTO has subsequently deleted the complainant's account and informed the complainant of this. Justification of the decision Applicable regulations, etc. According to Article 17.1, the data subject shall have the right to the personal data controller without unnecessary delay have their personal data deleted and the personal data controller shall be obliged to delete personal data about any of them without undue delay prerequisites listed in the article exist, for example if the information is not Date: 2023-05-22 are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they have been collected or consented to treatment is withdrawn. Article 11.1 states that if the purposes for which the personal data controller processes personal data does not require or no longer requires that the data subject is identified by the personal data controller, the personal data controller shall not be required to retain, acquire or process additional information in order to identify the data subject only for the purpose of complying with this regulation. According to Article 11.2, if the personal data controller, in the cases referred to in paragraph 1 of this article, can show that he is not in a position to identify it registered, the person in charge of personal data shall, if possible, inform the registered about this. In such cases, Articles 15–20 shall not apply, except when the registered for exercise of its rights in accordance with these Articles provides further information that makes identification possible. Article 12.6 states that, without prejudice to the application of Article 11, it may personal data controller, if he has reasonable grounds to doubt its identity natural person who submits a request under Articles 15-21, request that additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject is provided. According to Article 12.2, the personal data controller must facilitate its exercise data subject's rights in accordance with Articles 15–22. In the cases referred to in article 11.2 the personal data controller may not refuse to accommodate the data subject the request to exercise its rights under Articles 15-22, unless it personal data controller shows that he or she is not in a position to identify it registered. 2 In the European Data Protection Board's (EDPB) Guidelines 01/2022 on access is stated among other following. 53. The European Data Protection Board calls on the data controllers to provide the most appropriate and user-friendly communication channels, in accordance with articles 12.2 and 25 of the data protection regulation, so that it Data subjects can make an effective request. If the data subject makes a request using a communication channel provided by it personal data controller, which is different from the one indicated as the one who is preferred, such request shall generally be deemed effective and it the personal data controller should process such a request accordingly (see examples below). The personal data controllers should take all reasonable steps to ensure that the exercise of data subjects' rights is facilitated (if the data subject for example, sending a request to an employee who is on leave can be done automatically notification of an alternative communication channel for the request to it 3 registered be a reasonable effort). 2EPPB, Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights – Right of access, Version 2.0 (EDPB's Guidelines 01/2022 on the right to access), finally adopted on 28 March 2023. 3IMY's translation, original: The EDPB encourages controllers to provide the most appropriate and user-friendly communication channels, in line with Art. 12(2) and Art. 25 GDPR, to enable the data subject to make an effective request. Nevertheless, if a data subject makes a request using a communication channel provided by the controller28, which is different from the one indicated as the preferable one, such request shall be, in general, considered effective and the controller should handle such a request accordingly (see the examples below). The controllers should undertake all reasonable efforts to make sure that the Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-9109 7(12) Date: 2023-05-22 \[…\] 67. In cases where the person in charge of personal data requests or receives from the registered person additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject the personal data controller must each time assess which information will enable it to confirm the identity of the data subject and possibly ask the requesting person additional questions or request that it data subjects provide additional identification data, if it is proportionate (see section 3.3). 4 68. To allow the data subject to provide the additional information required to identify his or her personal data, the personal data controller shall inform the data subject of the type of additional information required to enable identification. Such additional information should not be more than that information originally needed for the authentication of the data subject. IN generally, the fact that the controller may request additional information to assess the identity of the data subject does not lead to excessive demands and to the collection of personal data that is not relevant or necessary to strengthen the connection between the individual and the personal data requested. 5 \[…\] 70. If the personal data controller has reasonable grounds to doubt the requester the person's identity, it may, as stated above, request additional information for to confirm the identity of the data subject. However, the personal data controller must at the same time ensure that it does not collect more personal data than is necessary to enable authentication of the requesting person. Therefore it should personal data controller make a proportionality assessment, which must take consideration of the type of personal data being processed (e.g. special categories of information or not), the nature of the request, the context in which the request is made as well as any damage that may occur as a result of improper disclosure. At the assessment of proportionality should be remembered to avoid excessive data collection at the same time as an appropriate level of security during processing is ensured. 6 exercise of data subject rights is facilitated (for example, when a data subject sends an access request to an employee who is on leave, an automatic message informing the data subject about an alternative communication channel for this request could be a reasonable effort). 4IMY's translation, original: In cases where the controller requests or is provided by the data subject with additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject, the controller shall, each time, assess what information will allow it to confirm the data subject's identity and possibly ask additional questions to the requester person or request the data subject to present some additional identification elements, if it is proportionate (see section 3.3). 5IMY's translation, original: In order to allow the data subject to provide the additional information required to identify his or her data, the controller should inform the data subject of the nature of the additional information required to allow identification. Such additional information should not be more than the information initially needed for the authentication of the data subject. In general, the fact that the controller may request additional information to assess the data subject's identity cannot lead to excessive demands and to the collection of personal data which are not relevant or necessary to strengthen the link between the 6ndividual and the personal data requested. IMY's translation, original: As indicated above, if the controller has reasonable grounds for doubting the identity of the requesting person, it may request additional information to confirm the data subject's identity. However, the controller must at the same time ensure that it does not collect more personal data than is necessary to enable authentication of the requesting person. Therefore, the controller shall carry out a proportionality assessment, which must take into account the type of personal data being processed (e.g. special categories of data or not), the nature of the request, the context within which the request is being made, as well as any damage that could result from improper disclosure. When assessing proportionality, it should be remembered to avoid excessive data collection while ensuring an adequate level of processing security. Data Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-9109 8(12) Date: 2023-05-22 \[…\] 138. The use of self-service tools should never limit the scope of personal data received. If it is not possible to provide all information according to Article 15 through the self-service tool, the remaining information must provided in another way. The controller may encourage it registered to use a self-service tool like that data controller has set up to handle requests for access. The however, it should be noted that the personal data controller must also manage access requests that are not sent through the established the communication channel. 7 The Swedish Privacy Authority's assessment Based on the current complaint in the case, IMY has reviewed the company's action in this individual case. Has the company been able to identify the complainant? The company has stated that based on the information in the complainant's request for deletion on 31 January 2021, the company was unable to identify the data subject. The information that provided by the appellant in the request did not, according to the company's data, yield any hits at a direct punching in the company's system, neither on that Facebook ID nor on any of them email addresses provided by the complainant. The company's opinion further states that when the company on March 4, 2021 received information about which game the complainant's request referred to they could find an account that one of the complainant's provided email addresses was associated with. Against background of this, IMY notes that the company could at least connect on March 4, 2021 the appellant's request for a user account and identification of the appellant was thereby Possible. IMY therefore assesses that the appellant in accordance with what is prescribed in article 11.2 of the data protection regulation provided such additional information as does the identification possible. The company has thus not shown that it was unable to identify the data subject, and therefore could not refuse to accommodate it either registered the request to exercise their rights under Article 12.2 i data protection regulation. Has the company acted in accordance with 12.6 of the data protection regulation when the company requested current information from the complainant? Has the company had reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of the complainant It is only when the personal data controller has reasonable grounds to doubt the identity with the person who made the request who receives additional information to confirm the identity is requested. What constitutes ""reasonable grounds"" in Article 12.6 of the Data Protection Regulation should assessed based on the circumstances of the individual case. The assessment of whether there is reasonable grounds to doubt in an individual case the identity of the person making the request is made normally in light of the information provided in connection with the request. The applies especially in situations where the person in charge of personal data lacks further knowledge about this person. However, the fact that an individual assessment is required does not preclude that 7IMY's translation, original: The use of self-service tools should never limit the scope of personal data received. If not possible to give all the information under Art. 15 through the self-service tool, the remaining information needs to be provided in a different manner. The controller may indeed encourage the data subject to use a self-service tool that the controller has set in place for handling access requests. However, it should be noted that the controller must also handle access requests that are not sent through the established channel of communication. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-9109 9(12) Date: 2023-05-22 routines are established for how the person in charge of personal data normally verifies it data subject's identity. From the appendix to the complaint, it appears that the complainant provided the following information when he Requested deletion on January 31, 2021: Facebook ID and three email addresses and one email address from which the email with the request was sent. The company has stated that at the time of the complainant's request for deletion did they process an email address associated with the complainant and probably also advertisingId/vendorId from the complainant's phone, the complainant's username and password. The company has been given the opportunity to justify the individual assessment based on which it was made the appellant's situation if they considered that they had reasonable grounds to doubt the appellant identity when he made his request. The company has essentially stated the following. The company's games are not played on Facebook but on mobile phones, why not Facebook IDs contributed to the verification of the appellant's identity. Email addresses are public and an indication of such is no evidence of ownership. The email address the request came from nor linked to any account with the company nor the Facebook ID which was specified. The appellant did not provide any surrounding information, such as username, which game it applies to or even that it is a game. The game that the appellant, according to later information, had played was so old that the company did not get either any hits on the other email addresses provided in the request. Using the information the company received on 4 March 2021 from the complainant about the game in question the company found a user account linked to one of the complainant's provided email addresses. In light of what the company stated and the information the complainant provided in his request regarding deletion, IMY states that the company had reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of the appellant. In the assessment, IMY also considers the fact that the obligation to ensuring the identity of the person making the request also aims to protect data subjects against someone else falsely making requests on their behalf, which may lead to negative consequences for the data subject. Has the information the company requested from the complainant been necessary to confirm his identity? Even if the personal data controller has reasonable grounds to doubt the identity of it registered, the personal data controller shall not collect more personal data than what which is necessary to enable identification of the requesting data subject. The personal data controller must carry out a proportionality assessment and be able to justify the verification method used. The company has stated that the request was changed to an access request on March 4, 2021 and the company then demanded that the request be made from within the player's account. Then user data may contain chat logs, the handling of the request for access is little more strict than when handling a request for the deletion of user data has the company stated. Regarding the necessity of the information they requested from it complainant in order to confirm his identity, the company has essentially stated the following. Usernames are requested as the task is assumed to be easy for most people to answer. The is, however, a task that is relatively easy for others to figure out. Username of three friends in the game are requested as most people who play this game have some friends played for years with. That task should therefore be easy to answer. Username on three opponents in the game is more difficult to provide but for people who play the most Date: 2023-05-22 against random players and not adding friends it is a necessary task to request in. It is not a requirement that the requester is right on all questions, but it is done a judgment based on how right or wrong the answer is. IMY notes that from the basis the company has submitted, consisting of email correspondence between the appellant and the company, it appears that the appellant has not waived its request for erasure. Of the email correspondence, especially the email that was sent by the MAG Support Team on March 11, 2021, it is further stated that the current the information was requested by the company in order for the complainant to gain access to the account i purpose of requesting deletion. The company's claim that the complainant's request for deletion had been changed to instead refer to a request for access, and that they requested the data intended to identify the appellant only in the event of a request for access can therefore be disregarded. The company has indeed requested more information from the appellant in order to confirm the appellant's identity, but IMY assesses that it is clear that it is still a request for erasure as the appellant wants it to be accommodated. It also appears that the company has requested the relevant information in in connection with the complainant's request for erasure. Regarding the information requested by the company from the complainant, states IMY following. Of the EDPB's guidelines on the right of access, i.a. that it personal data controller must take that type into account in the proportionality assessment of personal data processed (e.g. special categories of data or not), the nature of the request, the context in which the request is made and any damage that may occur arise as a result of improper disclosure. At the time of appellant's request the company only processed an email address that is linked to the complainant as well advertisingId/vendorId from their phone, the complainant's username and password. One According to IMY, incorrect deletion of said data would not involve any major problems disadvantages or consequences for the appellant. The requirements for identification could therefore set relatively low. It has also been shown that correct answers to all questions are not was required and that the complainant's identity could later be confirmed by another identification method that required significantly fewer data. Confirmation that it is the complainant's user account sent from the email address linked to the user account was deemed sufficient to confirm the appellant's identity and accommodate the request on November 7, 2022. IMY therefore assesses that, taking into account the nature of the request, the type of personal data that was processed and the identification method that was later used, that the data in form of username of three friends and three opponents neither can be considered to have been necessary or proportionate to confirm the identity of the complainant accordingly with article 12.6 of the data protection regulation. Has the company made it easier for the complainant to exercise his right to erasure according to article 12.2 of the data protection regulation? The next question is whether it has been consistent with Article 12.2 of the Data Protection Regulation to require the complainant to log into their account and make their request from within the game. The company has essentially stated the following. If the user can answer so well that the company assesses that the user owns the account, the support sets the email address for recovery. The player can then set a new password and log in. Because the case in it the current case had turned into a request for access, the company normally wants to the user must be logged in to their account to exercise their request. The Swedish Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-9109 11(12) Date: 2023-05-22 As IMY noted in the section above, it is clear from the company's documentation submitted that the appellant has not waived his request for deletion and that the company has requested the relevant information in order for the complainant to access the account i purpose of requesting deletion from within the game. The EDPB's guidelines on access include, among other things, that the personal data controller can encourage the data subject to use a self-service tool but that it Data controllers also have to deal with requests for access that do not sent via the established communication channel. By demanding from the appellant whose request for deletion has been received by the company after answering questions whose purpose was to confirm his identity, must log into a game to exit the game send his request, the company has not made it easier for the complainant to exercise his right to deletion. IMY thereby assesses that the company thereby acted in violation of Article 12.2 i data protection regulation. Has the complainant's request for erasure pursuant to Article 17 of the Data Protection Regulation accommodated? The complaint states that the complainant requested deletion on January 31, 2021 and that it has not been satisfied at the time of the complaint. The company has stated that the company on 7 November 2022, after email correspondence with the complainant on 30 October and November 6, 2022, have deleted the complainant's data and the complainant have been informed of this. Since the appellant's request for erasure has now been granted there is no reason to investigate the matter further in that part. Choice of intervention From articles 58.2 i and 83.2 of the data protection regulation, it appears that IMY has the authority to impose administrative penalty fees in accordance with Article 83. Subject to the circumstances of the individual case, administrative penalty fees must be imposed in addition to or instead of the other measures referred to in Article 58.2, such as injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83.2 states which factors must taken into account when deciding whether administrative penalty charges are to be imposed and at determining the size of the fee. If it is a question of a minor violation, IMY gets as set out in recital 148 instead of imposing a penalty charge issue one reprimand according to article 58.2 b. Consideration must be given to aggravating and mitigating circumstances circumstances of the case, such as the nature, severity and duration of the infringement as well as previous violations of relevance. IMY notes the following relevant circumstances. The current supervision includes MAG Interactive AB's handling of an individual complainant's request for deletion and the the violations found are relatively far back in time (2021). MAG Interactive AB has now also satisfied the complainant's request for deletion in full. Against against this background, IMY finds that it is a question of such minor violations in it meaning referred to in recital 148 which means that MAG Interactive AB must be given a reprimand according to article 58.2 b of the data protection regulation for those found the violations. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This decision has been taken by the special decision maker lawyer Evelin Palmér after presentation by the lawyer Anna Mlynska.

The appellant has requested to be informed of the recording of the current call. Nordea has complied with the request by the appellant have been able to listen to the recording on site at Nordea. The appellant has further been offered transcription of the conversation as well as a copy of the audio file with recording there Nordeas employee's voice is edited out, as it has been judged to have a negative impact on the employee's rights to disclose his vote. Justification of the decision Postal address: Applicable regulations, etc. Box 8114 104 20 Stockholm The right to access is regulated in Article 15 of the data protection regulation. Of the right of access Website: follows i.a. that the person in charge of personal data is obliged to a registered person, i.e. one www.imy.se identified or identifiable natural person, who requests it to provide confirmation of E-mail: imy@imy.se 1 Regulation (EU) 2016/79 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with Telephone: regarding the processing of personal data and on the free flow of such data and on the cancellation of 08-657 61 00 directive 95/46/EC. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-4559 2(3) Date: 2023-06-12 personal data relating to the registered person is processed or not. Treated as such data, the personal data controller must e.g. provide the data subject with a copy on the personal data that is being processed. This right to a copy shall not, however 4 adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. The purpose of the right of access is for the data subject to become aware that the processing takes place and be able to check that it is legal. The right to receive a copy of personal data includes a right for the data subject to receive an accurate and comprehensible reproduction of all personal data processed by the personal data controller 5 about him or her. IMY's assessment The complainant's voice, appearing in a telephone conversation, constitutes personal data about him the appellant, which the appellant is thus entitled to receive a copy of in an audio file. Nordeas however, the employee's voice does not constitute personal data about the complainant. As for that part of the current telephone conversation which consists of statements from Nordea's employees is therefore sufficient that the data, to the extent that they constitute personal information about the appellant, provided by a transcript of the conversation. In the case, it has emerged that Nordea has provided access by offering the audio file containing the complainant's voice and transcription of the conversation. IMY states thus that Nordea has satisfied the complainant's request for access. Against this one background, the Swedish Privacy Authority finds no reason to take any further action action in the matter. The case must therefore be closed. ------------------------------ This decision has been made by the acting head of unit Nidia Nordenström after presentation by lawyer Fredrik Löfgren.
