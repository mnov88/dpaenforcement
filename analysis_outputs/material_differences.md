# Material differences in GDPR fine outcomes

The bullets below focus on pairings that met two criteria: (i) Holm-adjusted p-value ≤ 0.01 for the omnibus test, and (ii) a practical effect size above 0.02 (epsilon-squared for Kruskal–Wallis, Spearman’s ρ for monotonic relations). Medians refer to the 1% winsorised fine metric, and ratios benchmark group medians against the overall median within each pair.

- **Legal basis relied upon — ε² = 0.18, Holm p ≈ 2.2×10⁻²³ (n = 710).** Cases in which authorities anchored the decision on contract law reported a median fine of €56k (28× the overall median), followed by legitimate interest arguments (€10k; 5×). By contrast, files recording “no basis claimed” had a median of €0 and a 59% zero-fine rate, underscoring how weak or absent bases align with lenient outcomes. The sharpest Dunn contrast arises between contract versus no-basis cases (adjusted p ≈ 5.2×10⁻¹⁷).
- **Reported turnover — Spearman ρ = 0.83, Holm p ≈ 3.8×10⁻⁴⁰ (n = 155).** Theil–Sen slopes indicate roughly €0.00046 in fine per euro of declared turnover (95% CI: 0.00028–0.00069), and the top turnover quartile (>€1.27 B) shows a €2.5 M median (≈42× baseline). This confirms proportional scaling of sanctions with organisational scale even after winsorising extremes.
- **Issuing country — ε² = 0.10, Holm p ≈ 3.1×10⁻¹⁷ (n = 853).** French cases (n = 60) exhibit a €232.5k median (116× median baseline), while Swedish matters have a zero median but extremely large means driven by a few mega-fines. Records coded as “UNCLEAR” are almost entirely fine-free (94% zeros), highlighting the need for metadata clarification in that cohort.
- **Jurisdictional complexity — ε² = 0.064, Holm p ≈ 8.0×10⁻¹¹ (n = 850).** Concerned-authority coordination cases (n = 6) yield €100k medians (50×), whereas lead authority and non-EU matters have zero medians but seven-figure means, reflecting rare yet outsized penalties once cross-border machinery activates.
- **Decision month — ε² = 0.087, Holm p ≈ 1.1×10⁻³ (n = 287).** Enforcement spikes are visible in December 2020 (median €550k; 55×) and January 2024 (€110k; 11×), suggesting batch publication cycles or thematic sweeps. Months pooled into the “OTHER” bucket hover around €5k (0.5×), reinforcing the episodic nature of headline fines.
- **Issuing authority — ε² = 0.037, Holm p ≈ 1.4×10⁻⁴ (n = 802).** Legacy Swedish regulator Datainspektionen (n = 8) delivered €1.53 M medians (≈508×), and the successor IMY exhibits a zero median but €4.9 M mean due to a handful of very large sanctions. Spanish authorities dominate volume with medians near €3k, illustrating how institutional identity conditions both tail risk and typical outcomes.
- **Repeat-offender status — ε² = 0.040, Holm p ≈ 7.1×10⁻⁵ (n = 536).** Organisations flagged as repeat offenders (n = 52) faced €50k medians (10×), while first-time violators clustered near €3k. Ambiguous histories (“UNCLEAR”) sat between the extremes, implying that clarifying recidivism coding could sharpen proportionality studies.

Pairs not listed (e.g., cross-border flags, cooperation level, breach typology) either fell below the effect-size threshold or lost significance after Holm correction, indicating limited evidence of material divergence under the robustness regime applied here.
