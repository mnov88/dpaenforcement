We're answering the overarching question: **"Given a breach, should we file a DPA notice now, and what enforcement risk follows from our choices (timing, subject notification, initiation channel)?"**

Our plan is to use the cleaned codebook fields—respecting status/coverage flags—to run causal analyses on the **72-hour timing effect**, the effect of **notifying data subjects when required**, and the impact of **initiation channel**, plus cluster breaches into profiles that map to expected **Article 58** remedies and fine levels.
We then synthesize the results into a concise **playbook and lightweight tool** that returns a recommendation (file now/initial notice/document only), with quantified risk deltas, profile-based expectations, and robustness checks suitable for counsel and DPA scrutiny.

## A) Ground rules required by the codebook (concise checklist)

1. **Always gate analyses by status/coverage flags**

   * Before using any content variable, filter or stratify by its status: e.g., `q53_powers_status`, `q31_violated_status`, `q56_rights_discussed_status`, etc.
   * Treat `NOT_MENTIONED`, `NOT_APPLICABLE`, `NONE_VIOLATED`, `NOT_DETERMINED` separately (per “IMPORTANT NOTES”).

2. **Time variables are sparse (75% missing)**

   * `decision_date` and `decision_year` are missing in ~75% of rows. Use **observed-time subsample** with **inverse probability weights** (IPW) for time-FE analyses; report a robustness spec without time FE but **with days_since_gdpr** where present.
   * If publication dates exist elsewhere, keep them **out** unless you pre-register that proxy.

3. **Breach subsample is small**

   * `breach_case=1` only in **208/1998** cases → plan power-aware models (penalized/Bayesian, wider CIs), cluster SEs by authority, and avoid over-stratifying.

4. **72-hour RD needs adaptation**

   * You don’t have continuous timestamps in the codebook; you have **categorical timing/delay** (e.g., `art33_delay_amount`) and (likely) `art33_submission_timing`.
   * Use **fuzzy RD / kink RD** if you have `WITHIN_72H` vs `NO_LATE`. If only delay bands: use **ordered logit + local polynomial around the 72h threshold** (approximate RD) and treat as **quasi-RD** with strong sensitivity analysis.

5. **Use what exists for “severity”**

   * You already have `enforcement_severity_index` and `severity_measures_present`. Prefer these over creating a new PCA severity index (still, validate correlation between them; if high (r>0.8), use the existing one).

6. **Turnover is ~90% missing**

   * Selection correction (Heckman/control-function) is **mandatory** whenever you analyze `fine_to_turnover_ratio` or caps; use `turnover_status` as the selection indicator and **interval regression** when only ranges exist.

7. **Country/DPA hygiene**

   * `country_code` includes **GB** and one malformed label (“COUNTRY OF THE DECIDING AUTHORITY: IRELAND (IE): 1”); harmonize to ISO-2.
   * Heavy **ES/IT** skew (ES 594, IT 284). Use **country FE** and/or **country-year reweighting** so Spain/Italy don’t dominate estimates.

8. **Exclusivity conflict flags**

   * Drop or repair records with `*_exclusivity_conflict=1` before modeling (rare but must be honored).

9. **Multi-select logic**

   * Use the decomposed binaries (e.g., `q53_powers_*`, `q31_violated_*`) exactly as provided. Keep the **coverage/status** rows to understand denominator changes across models.

10. **Text-as-data is available**

* `q36_text`, `q52_text`, `q68_text` present with partial missingness—good for narrative “quality/sincerity” scores. Use language fields (`*_lang`) to route multilingual models or MT.

11. **Vulnerable subjects & remedies**

* Use `q46_vuln_*` and `q47_remedial_*` binaries directly; coverage/status must gate them (lots of missing by design).

## B) Revised 4-step pipeline (with codebook-aware tweaks + brief note for counsel)

### 1) Feature assembly & design matrix (codebook-aware)

**What we do (methods):**

* Build master matrix from provided binaries: breach (`breach_case`), powers (`q53_powers_*`), principles (`q30_*/q31_*`), vulnerable groups (`q46_vuln_*`), remedial (`q47_remedial_*`), etc.
* Respect **status/coverage** variables: include only rows where the relevant `*_status` is `DISCUSSED` (or model `NOT_MENTIONED` as a **separate, informative category** via indicators).
* Time: create **two versions** of X — (i) **time-observed subset** (with `decision_year`/`quarter`) and (ii) **full set** without time FE but with `days_since_gdpr` where present. Compute **IPW** = 1/Pr(time observed | country, DPA, breach_case, year proxies) for time-observed analyses.
* Country: harmonize `country_code`; add FE; compute **country-year weights** to counterbalance ES/IT skew.
* Outcomes: `fine_positive`, `fine_log1p`, `enforcement_severity_index`.
* Clean contradictions: drop rows where `*_exclusivity_conflict==1`.

**Deliverables:**

* `X_master.parquet` (full) + `X_timeobs.parquet` (time-observed with IPW column).
* Data brief: coverage tables for every `*_status`, country harmonization log, and ES/IT reweighting note.

**Lawyer’s note (why this helps):**
We’re making sure we **compare like with like**, using only decisions where the issue is **actually discussed**, and not letting a Spain/Italy glut skew results. This preserves the legal meaning of “not discussed” vs “not applicable” and keeps the evidence defensible.

### 2) Causal core (what filing/notification **changes**) — adapted to your fields

**2a) 72-hour effect (timing)**

* **Design:** **Fuzzy/quasi-RD** at 72h using `art33_submission_timing` (within vs late) and `art33_delay_amount` (ordered bands) as the running/treatment proxies. Local linear fits around the cutoff; donut around boundary categories; report bandwidth sensitivity.
* **Sample:** `breach_case==1` and `art33_notification_required==YES_REQUIRED` (use its status flag).
* **Outcomes:** `fine_positive`, `fine_log1p`, `enforcement_severity_index`.
* **Controls:** Country FE, IPW (if time FE used), breach profile (`q46_vuln_*`, scale proxies if present), and mitigation binaries (`q47_remedial_*`).
* **Diagnostics:** McCrary-style bin tests on delay bands, placebo thresholds, clustering by authority.

**2b) Subject notification (Art. 34) when required**

* **Design:** Doubly-robust **AIPW/DoubleML** with treatment = `subjects_notified` (from your A26 equivalent), restricted to `art34_notification_required==YES_REQUIRED`.
* **Controls:** Breach profile (special categories, causation/type, vulnerable groups), mitigations, initiation channel, country FE; include timing proxy from 2a.
* **Heterogeneity:** CATEs by sector/size/public vs private using available org fields; small breach N → **Bayesian hierarchical shrinkage** for stability.
* **Sensitivity:** Overlap diagnostics, Rosenbaum bounds.

**2c) Initiation channel effects (A15)**

* **Design:** Multinomial GPS + AIPW (pairwise vs COMPLAINT), trimmed to common support.
* **Outcomes:** `fine_positive`, `fine_log1p`, `enforcement_severity_index`, and specific powers like `q53_powers_LIMITATION_PROHIBITION_OF_PROCESSING`.
* **Note:** Report both **country-FE** and **country-year weight** specs to show robustness to ES/IT skew.

**Deliverables (Step 2):**

* Tables of effects (point estimates, 95% CIs) + diagnostics appendix (support, sensitivity, placebo).
* One-pager for counsel: “Late vs within-72h increases sanction by ≈X; notifying subjects reduces risk by ≈Y under conditions Z.”

**Lawyer’s note:**
These are the **actionable levers**: timeliness and subject notification. We estimate their *causal* impact, properly adjusted for what the DPA actually discussed in each case.

### 3) Breach profiles → expected remedies (use existing severity indexes)

**Unsupervised:**

* Inputs: breach flags (`breach_case`, special categories, causation), vulnerable groups, any scale proxies; use **MCA** on binaries respecting coverage; cluster with **HDBSCAN** (noise allowed).
* Validate stability by bootstrap; drop countries with very few breach cases in sensitivity runs.

**Supervised mapping:**

* Predict `enforcement_severity_index`, `severity_measures_present`, and key powers (e.g., `q53_powers_COMMUNICATE_BREACH_TO_SUBJECTS`, `…LIMITATION_PROHIBITION…`).
* Models: regularized multinomial/ordinal with **country FE**, **authority random intercepts**; cluster SEs by authority.
* Include **time-observed spec** (IPW) and **full spec** (no time FE) side-by-side.

**Deliverables (Step 3):**

* “Cluster cards” that name profiles, show prevalence by country, and list **expected powers & compliance deadlines** (use `q55` if present; otherwise proxy with observed orders).
* Calibration plots linking profile risk to existing `enforcement_severity_index`.

**Lawyer’s note:**
Different breach **syndromes** trigger different orders/timelines. This turns messy facts into **predictable scenarios** you can cite when proposing remediation plans to a DPA.

---

### 4) Synthesis → playbook & minimal tool (with status semantics baked in)

**What we ship:**

* **Rules/score JSON** that only fires when relevant `*_status==DISCUSSED`, else returns “insufficient basis—document facts.”
* **Reweighting toggle** (country-year weights on/off) and **time-FE toggle** for sensitivity.
* **Turnover selection guardrails**: any cap/ratio output is labeled “selection-adjusted” and suppressed when `turnover_status≠DISCUSSED`.
* **Outputs:** Recommendation (File now / Initial notice + supplement / Document only), rationale (top 3 drivers), and citations to analogous clusters/outcomes.

**Deliverables (Step 4):**

* Playbook PDF (flowchart tied to field names in your dataset).
* Small CLI/Streamlit app that accepts your dataset columns and returns the recommendation + robustness flags.

**Lawyer’s note:**
This makes our advice **standardized and defensible**: it respects whether an issue was **actually addressed** in the decision, avoids overreach when data are not discussed, and documents the reasoning DPAs expect.
