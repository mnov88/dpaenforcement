I. Reminder of claims and facts With regard to referral No. f The French complainant requested access to his data and received some responses. He nevertheless referred the matter to CNIL, feeling that the responses were incomplete, as the identity of the investigative agency at the origin of the data collection was not communicated to him. Following the intervention of CNIL services, his request was granted. With regard to referral No. P| The data relating to the French complainant were processed by assignment agreement entered into with ‘he complainant has repeatedly requested the source of the data concerning him, as well as its retention period and its deletion. Following discussions with CNIL vices informed the complainant that his address and telephone number had been obtained from an investigative agency located in Israel. Your DPO has indicated to CNIL that the use of such an agency occurs only when the data collected from the transferring institution turns out to be inaccurate. based on a debt In addition, the complainant was informed of the “exceptional” closure of his case and that his data will be deleted after a period of six years from that closure. Your DPO justified this period by the fact that your company is “legally required to keep this data far anti-money laundering pur poses for a minimum of five years.“ With regard to referral No. Fs In this complaint submitted by the Polish Data Protection Authority, pursuant to Article 56.1 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the complainant challenged the lawfulness of the processing of data concerning him b and requested its erasure. He indicated that he was not a debtor and had never been a client of the ceding company From the complaint and the exchanges with your company’s DPO, the following details emerge: - after unsuccessfully attempting to contact the debtor concerned,ME appealed to an investigative agency, which sent it the contact details of the complainant on 13 July 2018; - on 23 July 2018, the complainant requested the erasure of the data from \[I after reccivingEE s letter informing him of the existence of a claim concerning him; - on 27 July 2018, he contacted I by email DE © obtain information, as he claims never to have taken out a loan withI - on17 September 2018, he received another letter asking him to pay his debt; - on 29 November 2018, during a telephone conversation with the complainant, eS services noticed that this was a case of mistaken identity (same surname and first name). His telephone number was then invalidated, but no further action was taken; - the complainant’s address and telephone number were anonymised following the intervention of CNIL services on 26 August 2019 (all data relating to the complainant was replaced by crosses, thus preventing any link between the true debtor’s file and the complainant); - the complainant was informed that this measure would therefore put an end to all correspondence with him. II. Analysis of the facts in question 1. Failure to respond to requests to exercise rights Pursuant to Article 12.3 GDPR, the Data Controller must respond to requests from individuals exercising their rights within a maximum period of one month. In the present case, the Polish complainant attempted to obtain information on the processing of the data and requested its erasure upon receipt of the letter of assignment of claim. An initial, insufficient measure was taken only four months after the complainant’s first request. It is only the intervention of CNIL services - over a year after the complainant’s first request - which led your services to respond satisfactorily. I also note that compliance with this obligation and taking into account the complainant’s requests from the outset could have enabled your company to identify the case of mistaken identity in July 2018 and thus immediately cease the processing of data concerning the complainant. I find ha i therefore disregarded Article 12.3 GDPR in that it did not respond to the complainant as soon as possible. 2. Failure to process accurate and up-to-date data Pursuant to Article 5.1.d GDPR, the personal data processed must be accurate and, if necessary, kept up to date. In this case, the case of mistaken identity was identified on 29 November 2018 when the Polish plaintiff disputed being a customer of the company and requested the deletion of his data. However, did not take adequate measures to remove any doubt as to this homonymy and immediately delete the data concerning this non-debtor complainant. Thus, the data relating to the complainant continued to be processed by I and was only anonymised after the intervention of CNIL services on 26 August 2019. I find that Po has therefore disregarded Article 5.1 d) GDPR in that it did not take the necessary measures to process only accurate and up-to-date data relating to a debtor and that it took the intervention of CNIL services to stop this breach."

However, it invites INED to immediately delete health data after recoding by category and to restrict as much as possible the number of authorized people who can access directly identifying data. It also recalls the need to set a retention period for pseudonymized data. The CNIL invites INED to provide a mechanism for opposing data matching that is easy and accessible to anyone, including those who do not have computer equipment and/or do not master computer tools. Regarding the methods of exercising rights, it recommends raising operators' awareness of attempts at identity theft. It also asks INED to consider solutions combining secrets transmitted to the participant during contact and data collected. The CNIL reminds that all security measures must be at least equivalent to the requirements of the CNIL “data warehouse in the health field” standard. THE NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR COMPUTING AND FREEDOMS, Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing the Directive 95/46/EC (general data protection regulation or GDPR); Having regard to law no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter the “data processing and freedoms” law), in particular its article 44.6°; On the proposal of Mr. Claude CASTELLUCCIA, commissioner, and after hearing the observations of Mr. Damien MILIC, Government commissioner, ADOPTS THE FOLLOWING DELIBERATION: The referral The context The Families and Employers longitudinal survey project (FamEmp) results from the observation of economic, social, demographic and political changes which increase tensions and erase the boundaries between private and professional life. In the sphere of employment, this concerns in particular the increase in precarious positions, atypical hours, digitalization allowing new forms of employment and work (e.g. nomadic, teleworking). In the family and personal sphere, family configurations and representations of the roles of women and men and parenthood are evolving (increase in union breakdowns, family reconstitutions, single-parent families and caregiving situations, etc.). Also, the FamEmp survey aims to make available to the scientific community statistical survey data relating to the balance between professional, family and personal life in order to analyze the impact of these interrelations on life courses and factors of risks according to professional and family characteristics. The three collection waves (2023 - 2024, 2026 - 2027 and 2029 - 2030) will be coupled, in part, with the European Generations and Gender Survey (Erfi 2 survey for France) in order to develop international comparisons. On December 2, 2021, the survey received the favorable opportunity notice from the National Council for Statistical Information (CNIS), attesting to its statistical nature, of public interest and the absence of other sources available to this subject. On October 5, 2022, it also obtained the label of general interest and statistical quality as well as compulsory status (visa no. 2023X042AU from the Minister of the Economy, Finance and Recovery). The subject of the referral The CNIL was asked for its opinion on May 22, 2023 on the first wave (2023 - 2024) of the FamEmp survey. To the extent that it concerns sensitive data within the meaning of the regulations, the proposed processing must be subject to prior notice from the CNIL in accordance with the provisions of article 44.6° of the “Informatics and Freedoms” law. The referral concerns three components of the treatment project: a general rehearsal of the questionnaire survey (according to the same protocol as the real survey, with a target of 600 Individual questionnaires and 200 Employer questionnaires); the actual investigation, comprising two parts: an Individuals component: a questionnaire administered by telephone or completed on the Internet to a sample of people aged 20 to 65 living in ordinary households in mainland France (objective of 30,250 questionnaires); an Employers section: a self-administered questionnaire, mainly via the Internet, to individuals' establishments when they include 10 employees/agents or more (objective of 9,000 questionnaires); matches with administrative data managed by INSEE: in the Individuals section: socio-fiscal data (from the files of the National Family Allowance Fund, the National Old Age Insurance Fund, the old age and family branches of the MSA, the housing tax and the income tax) and employment (from the “all employees base”, the “non-employee base” and the Sirene directory), making it possible to collect precise and reliable information concerning the employment and income of people selected at the time of the survey and between survey waves and to obtain information concerning non-respondents, unless they object; in the Employers section: employment data (from the “all employees database”) and companies and establishments (from the Sirene directory). The National Institute of Demographic Studies (INED) is responsible for this processing, which it implements on the basis of the execution of a mission of public interest (article 6.1.e of the GDPR). The CNIL’s opinion On the categories of data collected Some of the questions in the Individuals section relate to sensitive data relating to health, sexuality and religion. According to INED, this information is essential for studying the family trajectory, professional career and behavior of the respondent. In particular, an open question in the questionnaire aims to collect the existence, among the parents, spouse or children of the respondent, of an illness, pathology or deficiency diagnosed by the medical profession. The CNIL notes the need for an open question. Indeed, a closed question would be unsuitable both on a technical level (length of an exhaustive list) and on a semantic level (difficulty in listing pathologies, illnesses and deficiencies at the same time by grouping together both medical terms and everyday language terms). . She notes that the responses, optional, pseudonymized and recoded by category, will be stored on secure servers and will not be disseminated unencrypted in the files accessible to the scientific community. The CNIL invites INED to immediately delete the responses after recoding by category and draws its attention to the need for a strictly limited number of authorized persons to be able to access directly identifying data. On shelf life The “Study File” and the “Production and Research File” – both containing pseudonymized personal data and made available, respectively, on the Center for Secure Data Access (CASD) and on the network Quetelet Progedo Diffusion - will be archived ten years after the last request for access to the file by a researcher. The CNIL reminds that the dissemination of data must be carried out in accordance with articles 78 of the “information technology and freedoms” law and 116 of decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019. In particular, the data must first be anonymized to be disseminated and not pseudonymised, unless the interest of third parties in this dissemination prevails over the interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of the person concerned. For the results of the research, this dissemination must be absolutely necessary for its presentation. The data disseminated must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. The CNIL reminds that, in the case of dissemination of pseudonymized data, it is essential to set a retention period, as this data cannot remain available for an unlimited period. Furthermore, after the expiration of the retention period, a copy of all these non-anonymized files will be archived on a secure INED server and the original files will be transferred to the Archives of France. The CNIL questions the need to keep a copy of the files when they will be transferred to the Archives of France. In any case, she recalls that INED must set a retention period for these non-anonymized archives. On informing people Prior to contact with the respondent, an announcement letter accompanied by an information leaflet as well as an email or SMS (which will refer to the survey site including all information) if the contact details are available, will be sent individually to all selected individuals. At the start of the questionnaire, a text will remind you of the subject and objectives of the survey as well as the “computer and freedom” rights available to the person. Article 13 of the GDPR provides that, when personal data relating to a person is collected from them, the data controller provides them with information at the time of collection. The CNIL recommends that, from the start of the investigation, the investigator verifies that the person has received the information. All of the elements provided for in Article 13 should be delivered again to the respondent verbally or at the start of the web questionnaire, if applicable, including concerning the terms of exercise of rights. As a good practice and in order to protect against any risk of fraud, it also recommends setting up a system allowing the respondent to verify that it is indeed an INED survey. For example, an information portal including the verification points that respondents could check before responding to the survey could be put online. It recalls that the data controller must provide information relating to the recipients of the processing, which will also include the scientific community via the Quetelet Progedo Diffusion and CASD networks. Paradata - data collected in parallel with a collection device and which describes the process, where metadata describes the data collected - will be recorded. The CNIL invites INED to publish on its website the information according to which these paradata resulting from navigation in the questionnaire, retracing all the actions carried out by the respondents on the web interface as well as their date and time, will be collected. With regard to the information of third parties whose data could be collected, INED intends to mobilize the exemption provided for in article 14.5.b of the GDPR since, in particular, ""obtaining their identities and contact details and the provision of information would require disproportionate efforts, in particular because the data relating to third parties are processed to characterize the respondents and not with a view to collecting precise information on third parties"", which the CNIL takes note of. Furthermore, the survey website containing the required information will remain accessible online at least two years after the study. The CNIL reminds that as long as personal data is not destroyed, even when it is archived, the information must remain accessible to any person wishing to exercise their rights. On people's rights Respondents may object to the matching of their responses with administrative data via an email address indicated in the information notices of the advisory letters. The CNIL invites INED to provide an opposition mechanism that is easy and accessible to anyone, including those who do not have computer equipment and/or do not master computer tools. Regarding the terms of exercising rights, once the ""contact file"" has been destroyed, people who wish to exercise their rights, in particular their right of access, will be found either with their identifier, or, for those who have agreed to be contacted again, with their name, telephone number or email address. Failing this, INED may ask them a few questions in order to find the questionnaire that concerns them. The CNIL notes that these methods of exercising rights are based on information which may be public (for example, telephone number). It calls, given the sensitivity of the data processed, for the greatest precaution to avoid any identity theft aimed at accessing the data of a third party. It therefore recommends that operators responsible for implementing these rights exercises be made aware of the possibility of attempted abuse. It also asks INED to consider solutions combining secrets transmitted to the participant during the process (for example, when informing them of their rights) with identification questions based on the data collected. On accessors and recipients of data INED specifies that only data from the “study file”, the “production and research file”, as well as enriched versions of these files with administrative data, will be made available to the scientific community via the Quetelet Progedo Diffusion network or the CASD. The CNIL draws the attention of INED to the fact that the consultation of its storage system by a person located in the territory of a third country to the European Union constitutes a transfer of data outside the European Union. which must be carried out in accordance with Chapter V of the GDPR. On security measures INED has carried out and transmitted, in support of the request for an opinion, an impact analysis relating to data protection specific to the envisaged processing. Given the sensitivity of the data collected, the CNIL recommends that all tools, in particular the storage and work spaces used to conduct the study, and security measures comply with the state of the art and in particular security measures equivalent to the requirements of the CNIL “data warehouse in the health field” standard. In this regard, the CNIL recommends monitoring, automatic or manual, of any export of data outside of these spaces, in order to systematically verify its anonymous nature. Different random pseudonyms are assigned to participants in the files produced from the collection of responses to the two parts of the survey. These will need to be distinct for the different data flows. Any correspondence table must be deleted as soon as possible after consolidation of the database and the generation of new pseudonyms for it. For any provision, pseudonyms dedicated to each workspace must be generated. Data exchanges are carried out via encrypted communication channels ensuring the authentication of the source and recipient. In order to guarantee the confidentiality of secrets and the effectiveness of data encryption, the CNIL recalls that the transmission of any secret must be done via communication channels separate from those of the encrypted data or their provision link. The CNIL considers that the nature of the data in the study requires that it be subject to encryption measures in accordance with appendix B1 of the general security framework, both in terms of databases, correspondence tables and backups. INED must ensure compliance with security requirements at all stages of processing carried out by the various participating organizations. The security measures, which must be operational during the implementation of the processing, must meet the requirements provided for by Articles 5.1.f and 32 of the GDPR taking into account the risks identified by the data controller. It will be up to him to carry out a regular reassessment of the risks for the people concerned and to update, if necessary, these security measures. The other provisions of the draft decision do not call for comments from the CNIL. The president Marie-Laure DENIS"

(Authorization request no. 923197) The National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties, Submission on July 31, 2023 by the University of Bordeaux of a request for authorization concerning automated processing of personal data for the purpose of a study relating to the comparison of health trajectories leading to cardiometabolic diseases on a national scale for evaluate the interoperability of European health data entitled “EHDS FR-FIN”; Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing the Directive 95/46/EC (GDPR); Having regard to law no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, as amended, relating to data processing, files and freedoms (“data processing and freedoms” law), in particular its articles 66, 72 et seq.; Having regard to the favorable opinion with recommendations of the Ethical and Scientific Committee for research, studies and evaluations in the field of health of July 20, 2023; Considering the file and its supplements; After hearing the report from Ms. Valérie PEUGEOT, commissioner, and the observations of Mr. Damien MILIC, Government commissioner; Makes the following observations: The CNIL was contacted by the University of Bordeaux for authorization relating to the implementation of a research project relating to health trajectories leading to cardiometabolic diseases based on data from the National Health Data System. health (SNDS). This project is one of the five use cases selected by the European Commission as part of the creation of the pilot version of the European Health Data Space (HealthData@EU Pilot). Similar studies will be carried out, after authorization from the competent authorities, using Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Hungarian data, in order to compare the aggregated results. The Health Data Platform (PDS) will be involved in the implementation of the French study carried out by the University of Bordeaux. The distribution of roles and responsibilities between the data controller and the PDS, particularly concerning the awareness of project users, the monitoring of traces, the management of alerts and incidents as well as the management of exports of anonymous data, must be formalized by an agreement between the two parties, in accordance with Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). On the purpose of the processing, its lawfulness and the conditions allowing the processing of data concerning health: The purpose of the envisaged treatment is to implement a study on longitudinal health trajectories, in particular those leading to cardiometabolic diseases, and to compare these trajectories using French, Finnish, Danish, Norwegian and Hungarian data. This study, entitled “EHDS FR-FIN”, meets three objectives: establish a dictionary of disease evaluation criteria based on international diagnostic codes; assess disease distribution and longitudinal association of disease endpoints derived in the NSDS; build cardiometabolic disease prediction models based on health trajectories using statistical and machine learning approaches. The purpose of the processing is determined, explicit and legitimate, in accordance with the provisions of article 5.1.b of the GDPR. The processing implemented by the University of Bordeaux is necessary for the execution of the public interest mission with which it is entrusted. This processing is, as such, lawful with regard to article 6.1.e of the GDPR. In addition, this processing, necessary for scientific research purposes, also meets the condition provided for in Article 9.2.j of the GDPR allowing the processing of data concerning health. This research project is subject to the provisions of articles 44.3°, 66.III and 72 et seq. of the “data processing and freedoms” law, which results in the absence of conformity with a reference methodology, processing to purposes of research, study or evaluation in the field of health may only be implemented following authorization from the Commission. On the nature of the data processed: Provided that they can be disseminated by the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), the data controller requests access to the data from the national health insurance inter-regime information system (SNIIRAM), the health insurance program medicalization of information systems (PMSI) and medical causes of death (CépiDc), concerning the years 2010 to 2025. A cohort of approximately twelve million people affiliated to the general system and who have not objected to the reuse of their data contained in the SNDS will be randomly constituted for the purposes of this study. The data processed, the collection of which has been scientifically justified in the application file, will relate in particular to: sociodemographic characteristics (year of birth, sex, department of residence code and social deprivation index); causes of death, coded with ICD-10 (international classification of diseases); surgical and medical procedures (procedure codes and dates from outpatient health expenditures and hospital discharge summaries); clinical information (diagnosis codes, dates and length of stay from hospital discharge summaries; diagnosis codes and dates of registration for long-term condition; year, month and cause of death); medicines dispensed (codes and dates of medicines dispensed from healthcare expenditures dispensed on an outpatient basis and hospital discharge summaries). Only data that is strictly necessary and relevant to the purposes of the processing will be transmitted by the CNAM; in this regard, filtering and data matching will be carried out prior to this transmission by the CNAM. Since the data from SNIIRAM, PMSI and CépiDc come from databases making up the SNDS, all the legislative provisions (articles L. 1461-1 to L. 1461-7 of the public health code – CSP) and regulations relating to SNDS are applicable in this case, in particular: the ban on using this data for the purposes described in article L. 1461-1 V of the public health code; compliance with the safety standards applicable to the SNDS provided for by the decree of March 22, 2017. The data whose processing is envisaged are adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary with regard to the purposes of the processing, in accordance with the provisions of article 5.1.c of the GDPR. On information and people’s rights: Under Article 69 of the “Informatique et Libertés” law and Article 14.5.b of the GDPR, the obligation to provide individual information to the person concerned may be subject to exceptions, in the event that where the provision of such information would prove impossible, would require disproportionate effort or would seriously compromise the achievement of the objectives of the processing. In such cases, the data controller shall take appropriate measures to protect the rights and freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject, including by making the information publicly available. In this case, an exception will be made to the principle of individual information of people and appropriate measures will be implemented by the dissemination of collective information on the website of the data controller. This information note must include all the information provided for in Article 14 of the GDPR. This processing will also be recorded within the PDS transparency portal. These information methods are satisfactory with regard to the provisions of the GDPR and the “information technology and freedoms” law. Data subjects will be able to exercise their rights with the data protection officer of the data controller for the duration of the study. These methods of exercising rights are satisfactory with regard to the provisions of the GDPR and the “data processing and freedoms” law. On the duration of data retention: The data will be accessible for five years. Beyond that, the data will be anonymized or deleted. These data retention periods do not exceed the periods necessary for the purposes for which they are collected and processed, in accordance with the provisions of article 5.1.e of the GDPR. On accessors and recipients: Only the data controller and the persons authorized by him have access to the data within the framework of this single decision. The data controller maintains documents indicating the competent person(s) within it to issue authorization to access the data, the list of authorized persons, their respective access profiles and the terms of allocation, management and authorization control. These categories of people are subject to professional secrecy under the conditions defined by articles 226-13 and 226-14 of the penal code. The qualification of authorized persons and their access rights must be regularly reassessed, in accordance with the terms described in the authorization procedure established by the data controller. On data security and their hosting arrangements: The CNIL notes that the application file justifies the need to use the technical solution of the PDS, taking into account the characteristics as well as the specific modalities of implementation of this study. The security of the data of the project space dedicated to the ""EHDS FR-FIN"" project essentially depends on the technical solution of the PDS, which has been the subject of a global analysis of the risks and impact on privacy, followed by approval according to the SNDS safety standards. More specifically, an impact analysis relating to data protection was sent to the CNIL concerning the technical solution of the PDS, which corresponds to a secure SNDS bubble and which will host the ""EHDS FR-FIN"" project. The data controller has carried out and transmitted in support of the authorization request an impact analysis relating to data protection specific to the ""EHDS FR-FIN"" project and integrating the elements provided by the PDS for its technical solution . An approval of the project space was thus carried out by the data controller on April 4, 2023, for a period of three years, subject to the implementation of the action plan that he defined. This approval decision is only valid until April 3, 2026 and must therefore be renewed before this date if the project is still in progress. The security measures implemented by the data controller appear proportionate to the risks presented by the processing. On data transfers outside the European Union: The provisions of article R. 1461-1 of the CSP provide that no transfer of personal data may be carried out outside the European Union, except in the case of one-off access to data by persons located in outside the European Union, for a purpose falling under 1° of I of Article L. 1461-3 of the CSP. In this case, the application file mentions that, although the service provider is not exclusively subject to the laws and jurisdictions of the European Union, no transfer outside the European Union of individual data from the SNDS is planned, with no members of the research team located outside the European Union. Authorizes, in accordance with this deliberation, the University of Bordeaux to implement the processing mentioned above. The president Marie-Laure DENIS"

The president Marie-Laure DENIS Reference methodology relating to the processing of data from the main database of the National Health Data System implemented for the purposes of research, study or evaluation in the field of health by organizations acting within the framework of their legitimate interests (MR-008) Regulation (EU) No. 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (GDPR), and in particular Article 5, point 2, provides that the data controller must be able to demonstrate that the principles of the regulation are respected. Article 9(4) of the GDPR specifies that Member States may maintain or introduce additional conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data or data concerning health. Thus, in application of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended (“information technology and freedoms” law), the processing of personal data for the purposes of research, study or evaluation in the field of health can be implemented provided that the data controller has made a declaration of conformity with a reference methodology. In the absence of compliance with a reference methodology, the processing must be the subject of an authorization request from the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties (the CNIL). The CNIL may approve and publish reference methodologies, under the standards mentioned in II of Article 66 of the “Informatique et Libertés” law, established in consultation with the Health Data Platform (PDS), as well as with public and private organizations representing the stakeholders concerned. Among the most common processing of data from the National Health Data System (SNDS) are those carried out at the request of private organizations and more particularly of persons producing or marketing products mentioned in II of Article L. 5311- 1 (health products), of the public health code (CSP). These treatments make it possible in particular to prepare discussion files with the competent authorities and committees mainly in the field of medicines and medical devices (marketing, pricing discussions, CE marking, etc.) and the carrying out of studies under conditions actual use. In addition to that relating to data processing requiring access on behalf of persons producing or marketing products mentioned in II of Article L. 5311-1 of the CSP to data from the medicalization program of centralized information systems and made available on the secure platform of the Technical Agency for Information on Hospitalization, the Commission adopts a reference methodology relating to the processing of SNDS data necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller.

In accordance with the aforementioned standard, the data controller must ensure that the contract concluded with the research laboratory or design office specifies the security measures and conditions relating to compliance with the aforementioned standard. In particular, the controlled environment must have been the subject of approval prior to the implementation of the data processing necessary for the study. 3.6. The data controller or, where applicable, the person responsible for implementing the processing, must adopt the following technical and organizational measures: Distribution of roles and responsibilities SEC-REP-1 The distribution of roles and responsibilities between the processing manager(s), the person responsible for implementing the processing and the manager of the controlled environment must be formalized by an agreement. The latter must focus in particular on raising awareness among users of the study, monitoring traces, managing alerts and incidents as well as managing exports of anonymous data. This agreement must comply with article 28 of the GDPR. Management of authorizations and logical access to data SEC-HAB-1 Different authorization profiles must be planned in order to manage access to data as necessary and exclusively. SEC-HAB-2 Persons authorized to access personal data must be individually authorized according to a procedure involving validation by their line manager. SEC-HAB-3 A review of authorizations must be carried out regularly and at least annually, as well as at the end of each study. SEC-HAB-4 Access permissions must be withdrawn as soon as authorizations are withdrawn, for example after the departure of an authorized user or a modification of their missions. User identification and authentication SEC-IDE-1 Access to personal data must be subject to local or national identification for any natural or legal person, in accordance with the requirements of level 2 of the PGSSI-S identification framework. SEC-IDE-2 Access to personal data must be subject to strong authentication involving at least two distinct authentication factors, in accordance with the requirements of level 2 of the PGSSI-S authentication framework. If one of these factors is a password, it must comply with the CNIL recommendations on passwords on the date of writing of this methodology (deliberation no. 2022-100 of July 21, 2022) . Project space SEC-ESP-1 The data from a study must be handled by authorized users only in a project space specific to this study, sealed with the data from the central SNDS as well as with the project spaces of other studies conducted in the same controlled environment. SEC-ESP-2 Data sets imported into a project space specific to a study must be minimized and limited to only the data necessary for the study. A unique pseudonym number specific to each project space must be generated under the same pseudonymization conditions as those defined by the security framework applicable to the aforementioned SNDS. For example, this unique pseudonymous number could be generated by a cryptographic hash function resistant to brute force attacks or a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator. Data transmission SEC-TRA-1 All data transmissions from or to the controlled environment or project spaces must be subject to encryption measures in accordance with appendix B1 of the general security framework (RGS) in order to guarantee confidentiality. These encryption measures apply to data in transit and to its storage after receipt in the controlled environment or project spaces. Exporting anonymous data outside of workspaces SEC-EXP-1 Only anonymous datasets can be exported outside the controlled environment or a project space. The anonymization process must produce a dataset that complies with the three criteria defined by G29 Opinion No. 05/2014 or any subsequent EDPS opinion relating to anonymization. This compliance must be documented. Otherwise, if these three criteria cannot be met, a study of the risks of re-identification must be carried out and documented, prior to each export. SEC-EXP-2 Data exports must be subject to prior validation by a manager in order to endorse the principle, particularly with regard to the SEC-EXP-1 requirement. SEC-EXP-3 Exports must be subject to automatic or manual monitoring by a specialized operator in order to verify their anonymous nature. In the event that this monitoring is automatic, any export identified as non-compliant must be the subject of an alert and quarantine in a partitioned and dedicated space, then must be verified manually by a specific manager. trained and empowered. User awareness and workstation security SEC-SEN-1 Each person authorized to access the controlled environment must be trained in respecting professional secrecy and regularly made aware of the risks and obligations inherent in the processing of health data. SEC-SEN-2 Each person authorized to access the controlled environment must sign a confidentiality charter. This must specify in particular the obligations with regard to both the protection of personal health data and the security measures put in place in the controlled environment, as well as the sanctions relating to non-compliance with these obligations. SEC-SEN-3 The workstations of people authorized to access the controlled environment, including external users accessing only project spaces, must be subject to specific security measures, for example by setting up nominative accounts, adequate authentication , automatic session locking, hard drive encryption and filtering measures. In the event that the workstations are not under the control of the data controller, the security measures to be put in place on the workstations must be regulated by means of an agreement between the parties concerned. Logging SEC-JOU-1 The actions of project space users and those of users of the controlled environment must be subject to logging measures, in accordance with the requirements of level 3 of the PGSSI-S accountability framework. In particular, connections (identifiers, date and time), requests and operations carried out must be traced. SEC-JOU-2 A trace control must be carried out regularly and at least monthly, as well as at the end of each authorization period linked to a study. This control must be carried out by: a solution carrying out automatic monitoring with the reporting of alerts processed manually by an authorized operator; or by semi-automatic control via the execution of programs allowing selection of abnormal traces, followed by manual rereading by an authorized operator. SEC-JOU-3 The logging traces defined in the SEC-JOU-1 requirements must be kept for a period of six months to one year from their collection, unless otherwise justified by the importance of the risk for individuals in the event of diversion from the purposes of the processing. and the frequency of occurrence of such practices. In the latter case, the maximum retention period for logging traces can be extended to three years. Managing security incidents and personal data breaches SEC-INC-1 The parties to the agreement must provide a procedure for managing and handling security incidents and personal data breaches, specifying the roles and responsibilities and the actions to be taken in the event of such incidents occurring. SEC-INC-2 Any security incident, whether of malicious origin or not and occurring intentionally or unintentionally, having the consequence, even temporary, of compromising the integrity, confidentiality or availability of personal data, must be the subject of 'internal documentation in a register of violations. SEC-INC-3 Any data breach must be notified to the CNIL under the conditions provided for in Article 33 of the GDPR. SEC-INC-4 In the event that the violation is likely to result in a high risk for the rights and freedoms of a natural person, the data controller is required to communicate the data violation to the data subjects as soon as possible, in accordance with the article 34 of the GDPR. 3.7. These measures are not exhaustive and must be supplemented with regard to the risks weighing on the processing implemented. 3.8. In addition, Articles 5.1.f and 32 of the GDPR require security measures to be updated with regard to regular reassessment of risks and that the measures comply with the state of the art. Title IV: SUBCONTRACTORS 4.1. The data controller never accesses individual data from the SNDS and must use, for all processing, a research laboratory or an independent design office, a subcontractor having declared itself to the CNIL in compliance with the determining standards. the criteria of confidentiality, expertise and independence for research laboratories and design offices, set by decree of July 17, 2017. 4.2. This obligation to use a research laboratory and design office is not applicable to the latter when it acts as data controller. 4.3. In accordance with this decree and Article 28 of the GDPR, the respective commitments of the data controller and the research laboratory or design office are formalized in a contract whose content is defined by these texts. 4.4. In addition, subcontractors: must appoint, where applicable, a data protection officer in accordance with Article 37 of the GDPR; must keep a register of the categories of processing carried out on behalf of the data controller, in accordance with Article 30 of the GDPR. The data controller(s) undertake to: not have any links of interest with the research laboratory or design office and the subject of the processing likely to constitute a conflict of interest; not seek to access the personal data made available to the laboratory research or design office; do not use the results provided for any of the prohibited purposes.

This impact analysis must be re-examined and updated regularly, in particular if significant changes are planned in the processing implemented within the framework of this methodology, or if the risks for the persons concerned have evolved. 6.1.3. A single analysis can cover a set of similar processing operations that present similar risks. 6.2. Formalities 6.2.1. Each data controller appoints a data protection officer, in accordance with article 37 of the GDPR. This data protection delegate will have the particular mission of verifying compliance with the conformity of the processing implemented according to this methodology. 6.2.2. The data controller sends the CNIL a single declaration of conformity to this methodology for all the processing operations it implements as long as they are and will be carried out in compliance with all the provisions of the methodology. 6.2.3. As part of joint responsibility, each data controller makes a declaration of conformity to the reference methodology on its own behalf. 6.2.4. The treatments covered by this reference methodology must obtain an expressly favorable opinion from CESREES prior to their implementation. To obtain this opinion, a file must be submitted to the PDS single secretariat and must include the elements listed in this methodology. 6.2.5. In accordance with Article 30 of the GDPR, the data controller maintains, within the register of processing activities, the list of processing operations implemented within the framework of this methodology. It regularly checks the compliance of ongoing processing with the requirements of the reference methodology and documents this analysis. 6.3. Principle of transparency 6.3.1. The legal framework allowing the provision of SNDS data is designed to report their use to the population. To this end, article L. 1461-3 of the CSP makes access to the data of the SNDS and its components subject to the communication to the PDS of several elements by the data controller, before and after the study. 6.3.2. Thus, the data controller undertakes to record in the public directory maintained by the PDS each study carried out within the framework of this methodology. 6.3.3. This recording must be made, before the start of each study, by the data controller or the person acting on his or her behalf. It is accompanied by the transmission to the PDS of a file including: the protocol, including the justification of the public interest, as well as a summary, according to the model made available by the PDS. In the event of a favorable opinion with recommendations from CESREES, the protocol and the summary clearly taking into account the recommendations must be recorded; the declaration of interests, in relation to the object of the study, of the data controller, as well as than that of the research laboratory or the design office, as provided for by article 5 of the aforementioned decree of July 17, 2017. 6.3.4. At the end of the study, the method and the results obtained must be communicated to the PDS for publication in compliance with business secrecy and intellectual property. 6.3.5. The recording of the treatment and the transmission of the results are carried out in accordance with the procedures defined by the PDS. 6.4. Balance sheet 6.4.1. The data controller, where applicable after consulting the subcontractor(s), transmits to the CNIL every three years a report summarizing the observed uses of this reference methodology, indicating in particular: the number of studies implemented over the period analyzed; the types of purposes pursued; the financing arrangements for projects and partners (in particular public funding, etc.); on the data processed: the components of the SNDS mainly requested; compliance overall expression of needs for the objectives of the study; the historical depth requested on average and its sufficiency or not; the average number of people concerned by the studies; the average duration of access or retention of data requested and their sufficiency or not; the collective information supports implemented; the quality of the people authorized to access SNDS data; on data security: security incidents, likely to impact the rights of individuals, possibly revealed or avoided; any substantial modification to the architecture of the controlled environment; the number of scientific publications resulting from research, studies and evaluations carried out within the framework of the methodology; the benefits, scientific contributions observed and/or measured. Title VII: ENTRY INTO FORCE 7.1. This reference methodology comes into force from its publication in the Official Journal. 7.2.

Facts and procedure 1. Created in 1955, the company ELECTRICITÉ DE FRANCE (hereinafter “the EDF company” or “the company”) is a public limited company with a board of directors whose head office is located at 22 avenue de Wagram in Paris (75008) . 2. The EDF group, which includes the parent company EDF and its subsidiaries, is mainly active in France and abroad on the electricity markets and, in particular, in the production of electricity (nuclear, renewable and fossil) and the wholesale, trading, transportation, distribution and supply of electricity. The EDF group is also present in the gas and energy services markets, as well as in the construction, operation and maintenance of power plants and electricity networks and provides waste recycling and energy services. The EDF group employs more than 131,000 employees, including more than 63,000 for the EDF company. 3. In 2020, the EDF group achieved a turnover of more than 69 billion euros for a net profit of \[…\] euros. In 2021, its turnover amounted to more than 84 billion euros for a net profit of \[…\] euros. 4. As part of the services provided by the company, personal data of its customers and prospects are processed. At the end of December 2020, the company had in its databases 25.7 million customers for the supply of electricity, gas and services and approximately \[…\] prospects, regarding the individual market. 5. The National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties (hereinafter ""the CNIL"" or ""the Commission"") has received several complaints against the company EDF, relating to the exercise of rights between August 2019 and December 2020. 6. An online check was carried out on the website “www.edf.fr” on February 15, 2021. Report No. 2021-020-1, drawn up by the delegation at the end of the check, was notified to EDF on February 17, 2021. 7. A documentary inspection mission was also carried out by sending a questionnaire to the company on March 25, 2021, to which the company responded on April 29, 2021. 8. Two requests for additional information were sent to the company on July 13 and August 18, 2021. The company responded to them on July 30, August 31 and September 3, 2021. 9. For the purposes of examining this file, the President of the Commission appointed Ms. Valérie PEUGEOT as rapporteur, on May 19, 2022, on the basis of Article 39 of Decree No. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019. amended. 10. On June 23, 2022, the rapporteur notified the company of a report detailing the breaches of the GDPR that she considered to have occurred in this case. This report proposed to the restricted formation of the Commission to impose an administrative fine with regard to the breaches constituted in articles 7, paragraph 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 21 and 32 of the GDPR and L. 34-5 of the postal code and electronic communications (hereinafter “the CPCE”). He also proposed that an injunction to bring the processing into compliance with the provisions of Articles 7, paragraph 1, 14 and 32 of the GDPR and L. 34-5 of the CPCE, accompanied by a penalty, be issued. Finally, he proposed that the sanction decision be made public, but that it would no longer be possible to identify the company by name after a period of two years from its publication. 11. On July 25, 2022, the company produced its observations in response to the sanction report. 12. The rapporteur responded to the company's observations on August 11, 2022. 13. On September 9, 2022, the company produced new observations in response to those of the rapporteur. 14. By letter dated September 15, 2022, the rapporteur informed the company's board that the investigation was closed, in application of article 40, III, of amended decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019. 15. By letter of the same day, the company's council was informed that the file was included on the agenda for the restricted training of October 13, 2022. 16. The company and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the restricted training session. II. Reasons for decision A. On the failure to comply with the obligation to obtain the consent of the persons concerned for the implementation of commercial prospecting by electronic means 17. Under the terms of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, “direct prospecting by means of an automated electronic communications system \[…\], a fax machine or e-mails using the contact details of a natural person is prohibited \[…\] who has not previously expressed their consent to receive direct marketing by this means. For the application of this article, consent means any manifestation of free, specific and informed will by which a person accepts that data of a personal nature concerning it are used for the purpose of direct prospecting. \[…\] "". 18. Under the terms of Article 4, paragraph 11, of the GDPR, “For the purposes of this Regulation, \[…\] “consent” of the data subject means any manifestation of will, free, specific, informed and unambiguous by in which the data subject accepts, by a declaration or by a clear positive act, that personal data concerning him or her are subject to processing. 19. Under Article 7(1) of the GDPR, ""In cases where processing is based on consent, the controller is able to demonstrate that the data subject has given consent to the processing of data to personal character concerning her. 20. The rapporteur, to propose to the restricted panel to consider that the company has failed to comply with its obligations resulting from articles L. 34-5 of the CPCE and 7, paragraph 1, of the GDPR, as clarified by the provisions of article 4, paragraph 11, of the GDPR, is based on the fact that the company EDF, which carries out commercial prospecting operations by electronic means, is not able to have and provide proof of consent validly expressed by prospects whose data comes from data brokers before being canvassed. Furthermore, the rapporteur noted that, in the context of the investigation of three complaints, it appeared that the company had difficulty obtaining evidence from the data broker concerned regarding the collection of consent: the data broker produced the standard form, and not the form completed individually by each prospect, thus not being able to transmit individual proof of consent. 21. In defense, the company argues that none of the three complaints referred to in the report concerns electronic commercial prospecting operations and therefore that article L. 34-5 of the CPCE is inapplicable. The company adds that electronic commercial prospecting operations based on data collected from data brokers are very punctual and target an insignificant number of prospects (\[…\]%). In addition, the company indicates that it has always strictly regulated its contractual relations with the data brokers it uses and that frequent exchanges took place, even if they were not necessarily formalized in the form of audits. Finally, the company explains \[…\] that data already collected as part of previous campaigns has been deleted. However, it adds that it has evolved the contracts concluded with data brokers and implemented, from November 2021, formalized audits. 22. Firstly, the restricted training recalls that, when the prospects' data have not been collected directly from them by the prospecting organization, consent may have been obtained at the time of the initial collection of the data by the first-time collector, on behalf of the organization which will carry out subsequent prospecting operations. Failing this, it is up to the prospecting organization to obtain such consent before carrying out prospecting acts. With regard to the provisions of Article 7(1) of the GDPR, the prospector must then be able to prove that he has this consent. In addition, for consent to be informed, individuals must be clearly informed of the identity of the prospector on whose behalf the consent is collected and the purposes for which the data will be used. To do this, an exhaustive and updated list must be made available to people at the time of obtaining their consent, for example directly on the collection medium or, if it is too long, via a hypertext link referring to to said list and the confidentiality policies of service providers and suppliers. 23. The restricted panel notes that the three complaints received by the CNIL and referred to by the rapporteur do not relate to electronic commercial prospecting operations. It notes, however, that \[…\] prospects were the subject of commercial prospecting electronically by the company EDF between 2020 and January 2021, for which EDF is not able to provide documents demonstrating the obtaining consent validly obtained from individuals. 24. Furthermore, if the company provided the controlling delegation with two examples of standard form for collecting data from prospects made available by the data broker \[...\], the restricted training notes that no list of partners - including EDF- which must be made available to prospects at the time of consent, was not communicated as part of the procedure, despite requests from the rapporteur to this effect. 25. Secondly, the restricted training notes that, in the context of the documentary control, the company indicated that the data brokers are responsible for collecting the consent of the persons concerned and that it asks them to commit contractually to respect the GDPR and the rules applicable to commercial prospecting. The company acknowledged that it does not exercise any control over the collection forms used, nor carries out audits on its co-contractors, but affirmed that it conducts informal exchanges with them. 26. The restricted panel therefore considers that the measures put in place by the company EDF to ensure with its partners that consent was validly given by prospects before being approached were insufficient. 27. Under these conditions, the restricted panel considers that the company has failed to comply with its obligations resulting from articles L. 34-5 of the CPCE and 7, paragraph 1, of the GDPR, as clarified by the provisions of article 4, paragraph 11, GDPR. 28. It nevertheless notes that, in the context of the present procedure, the company indicated that it had deleted the data already collected in the context of previous campaigns. B. On the failure to comply with the obligation to inform individuals 29. Article 13(1) of the GDPR lists the information that must be communicated by the data controller to data subjects when their personal data is collected directly from them, including ""the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing. 30. Paragraph 2 of the same article provides that ""in addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide to the data subject, at the time when the personal data are obtained, the following additional information which is necessary to ensure fair and transparent treatment: a) the duration of retention of personal data or, where this is not possible, the criteria used to determine this duration \[…\]"". 31. Article 14 of the GDPR lists the information that must be communicated by the data controller to the data subjects when their personal data has not been collected from them. Paragraph 2 of the same article provides that ""in addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the data subject with the following information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing with regard to the data subject: \[ …\] f) the source from which the personal data come and, where applicable, a statement indicating whether or not they come from sources accessible to the public \[…\]"". 32. The guidelines on transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, adopted by the ""Article 29"" working group in their revised version on April 11, 2018, clarifying the provisions of Article 13, specify that : ""the retention period \[...\] should be formulated in such a way that the data subject can assess, depending on the situation in which he or she finds himself, what the retention period will be with regard to specific data or in the case of specific purposes The controller cannot simply state generally that personal data will be kept for as long as the legitimate purpose of the processing requires. Where applicable, different storage periods should be mentioned for different categories of data. personal data and/or the different purposes of processing, in particular the periods for archival purposes.” 33. They also specify that ""the waiver of the obligation to provide the data subject with information on the source of his or her personal data only applies where such provision is not possible due to the impossibility to attribute different elements of the personal data concerning the same person to a particular source. On the other hand, the simple fact that a database comprising the personal data of several data subjects has been compiled by a controller using more than one source is not sufficient to waive this obligation if it is possible (although time-consuming or tedious) to determine the source from which the personal data of the data subjects originate” (paragraph 60). 34. The rapporteur notes, on the one hand, a breach of Article 13 of the GDPR insofar as, at the time of the online check carried out on February 15, 2021, the legal basis was not mentioned and the retention periods data was not developed in a sufficiently precise manner in the “personal data protection charter” appearing on the subdomain “private.edf.fr”; it also notes a breach of Article 14 of the GDPR, insofar as the people contacted by post by the company were not informed of the precise source of their personal data, namely the the identity of the company from which EDF obtained them. 35. In defense, the company considers that the ""personal data protection charter"" which appeared on the website ""private.edf.fr"" during the online inspection of February 15, 2021 contained all of the information required under Article 13 of the GDPR and guaranteed “fair and transparent processing” of the data concerned. Regarding the retention periods, the company notes that certain retention periods were mentioned, although not exhaustive because the company was carrying out, at the date of the online check, a large overhaul of the retention periods. She considers that it was therefore not possible to indicate all the retention periods, since they were being reviewed and modified. Regarding the legal bases, the company indicates that Article 13(1)(c) of the GDPR does not require the controller to indicate to the data subjects each legal basis for each purpose pursued, but simply that it informs of the legal bases used. It specifies that it has nevertheless undertaken a profound modification of the charter mentioned, the update of which was published in April 2021 on the site ""private.edf.fr"". 36. Regarding the breach of Article 14, the company indicates that the nature of the source was at least referred to in the information notices brought to the attention of the persons concerned, namely an ""organization specializing in data enrichment"". She adds that limiting herself to fairly general information on the origin of the data made it possible to avoid confusion by suggesting to the person concerned that they were only registered in the data broker's database, whereas it was likely to appear simultaneously in several databases held by different data brokers. The company finally argues that there was no harm caused to people who could contact EDF in order to obtain more information. 37. Firstly, the restricted training notes that the ""personal data protection charter"" present on the subdomain ""private.edf.fr"" constituted the information delivered by the company under Article 13 of the GDPR for types of processing other than prospecting (for example creation of a customer account or subscription to an online contract). However, the charter did not specify the legal basis corresponding to each purpose listed, an element required by Article 13 of the GDPR. 38. Furthermore, if the restricted panel takes note of the explanations provided by the company regarding the overhaul of the retention periods in progress at the time of the online findings made by the control delegation, the fact remains that , at the time of these findings, the said charter specified ""We only keep your data for the period necessary for their processing according to the purpose that has been set"", with an example relating to the retention periods for customers equipped with a Linky meter . The restricted training considers that the information on retention periods was vague and imprecise, so that it was not sufficient to guarantee ""fair and transparent processing"" of the personal data processed. 39. Therefore, the restricted panel considers that the company failed to comply with its obligations resulting from Article 13 of the GDPR. It nevertheless takes note of the fact that the company has remedied this breach, since the legal bases and retention periods are now detailed in the charter mentioned above. 40. Secondly, with regard to the breach of Article 14 of the GDPR, the restricted committee notes that, on the first prospecting letter sent to the complainants (referrals no. \[…\], no. \[…\] and no. \[…\]), whose data was obtained indirectly, the following statement appears: “EDF, data controller, implements processing of personal data for prospecting purposes \[…\]. Your data was collected from an organization specializing in data enrichment. 41. The restricted panel considers that the sole mention that the data was collected from an ""organization specializing in data enrichment"", appearing in the first commercial prospecting letter sent by EDF, is not sufficiently precise as to to the source from which the data comes. This information is therefore not likely to ""guarantee fair and transparent treatment"" with regard to the prospect, in particular in a context of successive resales of data between multiple actors and in the event that the prospect wishes to exercise its rights with the data broker whose identity he does not know. 42. The restricted panel considers that the absence of significant harm for people invoked by the company and the possibility of contacting EDF in order to obtain more information has no influence on the characterization of the failure to inform people , which is an obligation distinct from the right to obtain any available information as to the source of the data pursuant to Article 15(1)(g) of the GDPR. 43. Therefore, the restricted panel considers that the aforementioned facts constitute a breach of Article 14 of the GDPR. 44. The restricted committee notes that during the procedure, the company modified the information contained in the prospecting letters, in order to include the name of the data broker concerned. C. On breaches linked to the exercise of individual rights 45. Under Article 12 of the GDPR: ""1. The controller shall take appropriate measures \[…\] to make any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 regarding the processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, understandable and easily accessible, in clear and simple terms \[...\]. The information is provided in writing or by other means including, where appropriate, electronically. When the data subject requests it, the Information may be provided orally, provided that the identity of the person concerned is demonstrated by other means. \[…\] 3. The controller shall provide the data subject with information on the measures taken following a request made pursuant to Articles 15 to 22, as soon as possible and in any event within one month. from receipt of the request. If necessary, this deadline may be extended by two months, taking into account the complexity and number of requests. The data controller shall inform the data subject of this extension and the reasons for the postponement within one month of receipt of the request. \[…\] 4. If the data controller does not respond to the request made by the data subject, he shall inform the data subject without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request of the reasons for his request. inaction and the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking legal recourse. \[…\] "". 46. Article 15(1) of the GDPR provides for the right of an individual to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed and, where they are, to access to personal data concerning them, in particular ""g) when the personal data are not collected from the person concerned, any information available as to their source"". It is also provided in paragraph 3 of the same article that “the data controller shall provide a copy of the personal data subject to processing. \[…\]”. 47. Article 21(2) of the GDPR provides that, “When personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject has the right to object at any time to the processing of the personal data concerning it for such prospecting purposes, including profiling to the extent that it is linked to such prospecting. \[…\] "" 1. On the breach of the obligation of transparency 48. The rapporteur, to propose to the restricted panel to consider that the company has failed to comply with its obligations resulting from Article 12 of the GDPR, relies on two referrals to the CNIL, emanating from Mr \[…\] (referral no. \[… \]) and Mr \[…\] (referral no \[…\]). Regarding the first referral, the rapporteur noted that the company EDF had contacted the complainant by telephone to provide him with a response, without sending him a written letter, in violation of Article 12, paragraph 1, of the GDPR. In addition, the answer given to him about the organization behind the data was incorrect. Finally, the company answered his questions, again by phone, more than nine months later. Regarding the second referral, the rapporteur noted that the company had closed the complainant's request instead of transmitting it to the department in charge of requests to exercise rights and had not responded to Mr. \[…\]. It was only six months after his initial request – as part of the control procedure – that a response was provided to the complainant. 49. In defense, the company indicates that EDF's policy has always been to respond in writing to all requests to exercise rights from its prospects and customers. It specifies that, for any written complaint, the advisor attempts to contact the prospect or client by telephone, before sending them a documented response in written form. The company adds that the lack of a written response to Mr. \[…\] is a simple human error committed by the advisor, who did not follow internal procedures. The company adds that the processing of requests to exercise rights from complainants took place in the particularly difficult context of both the health crisis, which led to an increase in the number of requests to exercise rights, and postponement of the end of the winter break to September 1, 2020, which may explain why their mail could not be correctly processed within the usual deadlines. 50. The restricted panel notes that the company recognizes an error in the direction of the complainants' requests which resulted in ""either a lack of response within the time limit, or a poor quality of response"". A breach of the obligations of Article 12 of the GDPR is constituted when the company did not provide a written response and gave the complainant incorrect information regarding the referral to Mr. \[…\]. In addition, the company did not process these requests to exercise rights within the time limit with regard to the two referrals. 51. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that the breach of Article 12 of the GDPR has been established. 2. On the failure to comply with the obligation to respect the right of access 52. The rapporteur, to propose to the restricted panel to consider that the company has failed to comply with its obligations resulting from Article 15 of the GDPR in terms of right of access, relies on two referrals to the CNIL, emanating from Mr. (referral no \[…\]) and Madam (referral no \[…\]). Regarding the referral from Mr \[…\], the first response given by telephone to the complainant on the source of the data collected was incorrect. As for the referral from Madame \[…\], the company specifies that a response was sent to it on July 17, 2020, indicating that it had no other data concerning her than her first and last name in its databases . The rapporteur considered that such a statement was inaccurate and that the company at least had its address – or former address – to make the comparison with the first and last name of the complainant since the EDF company sent her a letter to her home. parents. 53. In defence, with regard to the referral relating to Mr \[…\], the company acknowledges that the advisor's response to the complainant was ""partly inaccurate"" due to an error regarding the source of the data. As for the referral relating to Mrs \[…\], the company considers that the response given to it by the advisor was correct since the only data relating to the complainant were her first and last name. 54. In view of the elements provided by the company, the rapporteur proposes to the restricted panel not to consider the breach of Article 15 of the GDPR with regard to the referral relating to Mrs \[…\]. 55. The restricted panel notes that the facts noted by the rapporteur are not contested by the company with regard to the referral from Mr \[…\] and that it is proven that an inaccurate response was provided to him in the context of his request for right of access. She considers that a breach of the obligations of Article 15 has occurred with regard to this complaint, since the company provided her with erroneous information on the source of the data collected as part of her right of access request. . On the other hand, with regard to the complaint of Mrs \[…\], the restricted panel takes note of the elements provided by the company and considers that the alleged breach is not characterized. 3. On the failure to comply with the obligation to respect the right of opposition 56. The rapporteur, to propose to the restricted panel to consider that the company has failed to comply with its obligations resulting from Article 21 of the GDPR, relies on the referral from Mr. \[…\] (no. \[…\]). The rapporteur indicates that the company did not take into account the complainant's opposition to the processing of the personal data of his minor son for commercial prospecting purposes. Indeed, the minor son of Mr \[…\] received a second commercial prospecting letter, despite the latter's request for the deletion of personal data relating to his son. 57. In defense, the company explains that, in the May 2020 “Complaint” guide for all advisors, the latter were instructed, for any request to delete a prospect’s data, to “systematically collect the prospect's objection"". Concerning the referral from Mr \[…\], the advisor did proceed with the erasure of the data as he had indicated by telephone to the complainant but did not completely follow the internal procedure by not proceeding with the opposition before erase data. The company adds that it has simplified this deletion procedure. Thus, since July 2021, when the advisor processes a deletion request, an opposition is automatically implemented. 58. The restricted panel notes that the facts noted by the rapporteur regarding the complainant's situation are not contested by the company and constitute a breach of the obligations arising from Article 21 of the GDPR. It notes that during the sanction procedure, the company improved its procedure for managing erasure requests. D. On the failure to comply with the obligation to ensure data security 59. Under Article 32(1) of the GDPR, ""Taking into account the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as risks, the degree of probability and severity of which varies, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee a level of security adapted to the risk , including among others, as needed: has) \[…\] ; (b) means to ensure the continued confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; vs) \[…\] ; (d) a procedure aimed at regularly testing, analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing. "". • On the password hashing function of the “prime energy” portal 60. Taking into account the company's initial declarations during the inspection procedure, the rapporteur noted that the passwords to the customer area of the ""prime energy"" portal were stored using the MD5 hash function. The rapporteur then took note of the company's new claims and the fact that, since January 2018, the SHA-256 hash function has been used. It nevertheless noted that, until July 2022, the passwords of more than 25,800 accounts were stored insecurely, with the MD5 hash function. 61. In defense, the company explains that, since January 2018, all registrations or modifications of a user password are recorded in the directory associated with the ""prime energy"" portal in SHA-256 with a random mechanism associated (salting). The MD5 hash corresponds only to the hashing level historically implemented by the company \[…\], subcontractor of EDF, and for which only a few thousand accounts were still affected in April 2021. The company adds that these passwords were still stored with the robustness of the additional randomness mechanism (salting), preventing attacks by precomputed tables. She concluded that the passwords were secure. In addition, the company indicates that, since the beginning of 2022, a final purge of passwords that were still stored using the MD5 hash function (approximately 3.2% of the total number of prime energy customers "") was realized. It specifies that all the passwords of users of the “prime energy” site are today stored with a salt and a strong algorithm. 62. The restricted training recalls that it follows from the provisions of Article 32 of the GDPR that the data controller is required to ensure that the automated data processing that it implements is sufficiently secure. The sufficiency of the security measures is assessed, on the one hand, with regard to the characteristics of the processing and the risks it induces, and on the other hand, taking into account the state of knowledge and the cost of the measures. Implementing a robust authentication policy constitutes a basic security measure which generally contributes to compliance with the obligations of Article 32 of the GDPR. Thus, it is necessary to ensure that a password allowing authentication to a system cannot be disclosed. Keeping passwords secure is a basic precaution when it comes to protecting personal data. As early as 2013, the National Information Systems Security Agency (ANSSI) alerted and recalled good practices regarding the retention of passwords, indicating that they must ""be stored in a form transformed by a function one-way cryptographic (hash function) and slow to calculate such as PBKDF2"" and that ""the transformation of passwords must involve a random salt to prevent an attack by precomputed tables"". Indeed, non-robust hash functions present known vulnerabilities which do not guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of passwords in the event of a brute force attack after compromise of the servers which host them. To the extent that a large number of Internet users use the same password to authenticate to their different online accounts, attackers could exploit the compromised data to increase intrusions on their other accounts to commit, for example, theft or scams. 63. Likewise, the Commission also specifies in its deliberation no. 2017-012 of January 19, 2017, with regard to the storage methods, that ""the password must never be stored in clear text. It recommends that it be transformed by means of a non-reversible and secure cryptographic function (i.e. using a public algorithm deemed strong whose software implementation is free of known vulnerabilities), integrating the use of a salt or a key. The Commission further considers that the salt or the key must be generated by means of a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (that is to say based on a public algorithm deemed strong whose implementation software is free of known vulnerabilities), and not be stored in the same storage space as the password verification item. 64. In addition to these recommendations, the restricted committee emphasizes that it has, on several occasions, adopted financial sanctions where the characterization of a breach of Article 32 of the GDPR is the result of insufficient measures to guarantee the security of the data processed. . She thus had the opportunity to recall that ""the use of the MD5 hash function by the company has no longer been considered state of the art since 2004 and its use in cryptography or security is prohibited. Thus , the use of this algorithm would allow a person with knowledge of the hashed password to decipher it without difficulty in a very short time (for example, by means of freely accessible websites which make it possible to find the value corresponding to the hash of the password) ""(deliberation SAN-2021-008 of June 14, 2021). 65. However, the restricted panel notes that, until July 2022, the passwords of more than 25,800 accounts were kept insecurely, with the MD5 hash function. Under these conditions, having regard to the risks incurred by individuals, the restricted committee considers that the company has failed to fulfill its obligations under Article 32 of the GDPR. 66. It nevertheless notes that, in the context of this procedure, the company has justified having taken measures to comply with the obligations arising from Article 32 of the GDPR. • On the password hashing function in the EDF customer area 67. Taking into account the company's initial declarations during the control procedure, the rapporteur noted that the passwords to the EDF customer area, accessible at the URL ""www.particuliers.edf.fr"", were stored in chopped and salted form using the SHA-1 function, although it is considered obsolete. It therefore considered that the methods for storing passwords do not guarantee the security and confidentiality of customers' personal data. 68. In defense, the company indicates that the hashing algorithm used to store passwords in the directory \[…\], which manages the authentication of customer areas, is in reality SHA-512 supplemented by a mechanism of the addition of hazard (salting) since May 17, 2017, and not SHA-1, contrary to what it had indicated to the control delegation. The company adds that the renewal of passwords and the purging of old passwords were carried out in a phased manner. 69. In the latest state of her submissions, the rapporteur notes that, if 11,241,166 account passwords are hashed and salted, 2,414,254 account passwords are hashed only, without having been salted. 70. In defense, the company recalls that it deploys significant resources, both human and material, in terms of cybersecurity. She adds that, since her last observations, the company implemented the mechanism of adding randomness (salting) to the fraction of passwords in the directory \[...\] which did not have it, but which were however already hashed with SHA-512. Thus, to this day there is no longer any SHA-512 hashed password without a random addition mechanism (salting). 71. Restricted training refers to the developments above regarding the need to use a random salt for the transformation of passwords (§§ 62 and 63). It further notes that, in its guide “Recommendations relating to multi-factor authentication and passwords” of October 8, 2021, ANSSI writes: “It is recommended to use a salt chosen randomly for each account and to a length of at least 128 bits"". 72. The restricted panel notes that, here again, the company does not contest the breach itself but requests not to be sanctioned to the extent that it has now remedied the breach. The restricted panel considers that the company has failed to fulfill its obligations under Article 32 of the GDPR, since it has not taken the necessary measures to ensure the security of all the data it processes. and which are accessible from user accounts at the URL ""www.particuliers.edf.fr"", by not systematically using a salt in the transformation of passwords. 73. It nevertheless notes that, in the context of this procedure, the company has justified having taken measures to comply with the obligations arising from Article 32 of the GDPR. III. On corrective measures and their publicity 74. Under the terms of article 20, III, of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended, ""When the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or of this law, the president of the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties may also, where appropriate after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, where appropriate in addition to a notice remains provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted formation of the commission with a view to pronouncing, after adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the global annual turnover total of the previous financial year, the highest amount being retained. In the hypotheses mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted panel takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83"". 75. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that ""each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this article for violations of this regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case , effective, proportionate and dissuasive"", before specifying the elements to be taken into account when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and when deciding the amount of this fine. 76. Firstly, on the principle of issuing a sanction, the company indicates that in addition to the fact that it contests the failings alleged by the rapporteur or justifies them, it has already taken all measures to remedy all of the alleged facts and ensure compliance with applicable legislation. She emphasizes the goodwill and efforts she demonstrated throughout the procedure. The company considers that the mitigating factors posed by Article 83, paragraph 2, of the GDPR should lead the restricted body not to impose a financial sanction or at the very least to very significantly reduce the amount of the fine proposed by the rapporteur. It considers that the alleged breaches are not substantial in this case, since they represented a limited or even non-existent impact on the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned given their small number and their non-structural nature. 77. The restricted committee recalls that it must take into account, when issuing an administrative fine, the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, seriousness and duration of the violation, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and the categories of personal data affected by the violation. 78. The restricted training underlines that the breaches committed by the company relate to obligations relating to the fundamental principles of the protection of personal data and that numerous breaches are made. 79. The restricted training then notes that the company is the leading player in electricity in France, since it counted, at the end of December 2020, 25.7 million customers for the supply of electricity, gas and services and approximately \[…\] prospects, regarding the individual market. It therefore has significant resources enabling it to deal with personal data protection issues. 80. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that it is appropriate to impose an administrative fine with regard to the breaches constituted by article L. 34-5 of the CPCE and articles 7, paragraph 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 21 and 32 of the GDPR. 81. The restricted training nevertheless underlines the efforts that the company EDF demonstrated within the framework of the procedure, since it complied with all the shortcomings noted by the rapporteur. It further considers that the failure to comply with the obligation to obtain the consent of the persons concerned for the implementation of commercial prospecting by electronic means, although being a structural failure, is in this case of limited seriousness in the to the extent that the number of prospects whose data has been collected from data brokers and who have received commercial prospecting electronically only represents \[…\]% over the period 2020-2022 of all people targeted by actions commercial prospecting carried out by EDF with prospects whose data was obtained via data brokers. Regarding the failure to comply with the information obligation, the restricted committee takes note of the company's declarations, according to which it was carrying out a large overhaul of the retention periods, thus preventing it from indicating them all since they were in review and modification course. It further notes, with regard to the referrals made to the debates, that the breaches of people's rights are not structural and result from human errors. 82. The restricted panel recalls that the violations of the GDPR noted in this case are breaches of principles likely to be subject, under Article 83 of the GDPR, to an administrative fine of up to 20,000,000 euros or up to 4% of the global annual turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher. 83. The restricted panel also recalls that administrative fines must be both dissuasive and proportionate. It considers in particular that the activity of the company and its financial situation must be taken into account in determining the amount of the administrative fine. It notes in this regard that the EDF group achieved a turnover of more than 69 billion euros for a net result of \[…\] euros in 2020 and more than 84 billion euros for a net result of \[ …\] euros in 2021. 84. Therefore, in view of these elements, the restricted panel considers that the imposition of an administrative fine in the amount of 600,000 euros appears justified. 85. Secondly, an injunction to bring the processing into compliance with the provisions of Articles 7, paragraph 1, 14 and 32 of the GDPR and L. 34-5 of the CPCE was initially proposed by the rapporteur. 86. The company maintains that the actions it has implemented with regard to all the breaches noted must result in not issuing an injunction under penalty. 87. As indicated previously, the restricted panel notes that the company has taken compliance measures with regard to all of the shortcomings noted by the rapporteur. It therefore considers that there is no need to issue an injunction. 88. Thirdly, with regard to the publication of the sanction decision, the company asks the restricted body not to publish it or, in the alternative, to anonymize it immediately or at the latest within eight days. 89. The restricted panel considers that the publicity of the sanction is justified in view of the nature and number of breaches committed, as well as the number of people affected by said violations, in particular more than 2,400,000 customers with regard to the breach. to data security. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: • impose an administrative fine against the company ÉLECTRICITÉ DE FRANCE in the amount of 600,000 (six hundred thousand) euros for breaches of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE and articles 7, paragraph 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 21 and 32 of the GDPR; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. President Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be the subject of an appeal before the Council of State within two months of its notification."

Facts and procedure 1. MICROSOFT CORPORATION, a multinational company created in 1976 whose head office is located in the United States, has as its main activity the development and sale of operating systems, application software, hardware and derived services. It also has a consulting and support activity for all MICROSOFT products. Its turnover was $143 billion in 2020 and $168 billion in 2021. In 2020, it employed nearly 148,000 people in 120 countries. 2. MICROSOFT IRELAND OPERATIONS LIMITED (hereafter ""MIOL""), is a subsidiary of MICROSOFT CORPORATION whose registered office is located at 1, Microsoft Place, South County Business Park, Leopardstown in Dublin. Its main activity is the marketing and sales of software for the Europe and Asia-Pacific region. Its turnover amounted, in 2020, to \[…\] for an annual profit of \[…\] and to \[…\] for an annual profit of \[…\] in 2021. 3. MIOL operates and develops the Bing search engine in the European Economic Area. The ""bing.com"" domain accessible from France had 10,801,000 unique users residing in France in September 2020 and the turnover attributable to the ""bing.com"" domain in France amounted to \[…\] in 2020 and to \[…\] in 2021. 4. MICROSOFT FRANCE, a subsidiary of MICROSOFT CORPORATION and sister company of MIOL, is a simplified joint-stock company, registered with the Nanterre Trade and Companies Register under number 327733184, whose registered office is located at 37 /45, quay of President Roosevelt, Issy-les-Moulineaux (92130). It specializes in the distribution, promotion and sale of computer products and services. In 2020, it achieved a turnover of 2.2 billion euros, for a net result of 77.9 million euros and, in 2021, of 2.6 billion euros for a net result of 92.4 million euros. 5. Following a referral registered on 21 February 2020 in which the complainant denounced the conditions for obtaining his consent to the deposit of tracers (""cookies"") from the domain ""bing.com"", a delegation from the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (hereinafter ""the CNIL"" or ""the Commission"") carried out an online check on the ""bing.com"" website on September 29, 2020, pursuant to Decisions No. 2020 -128C and 2020-253C of September 8, 2020 from the President of the CNIL. The purpose of this control was to verify the compliance of any processing accessible from the ""bing.com"" domain from a terminal located in France with the law n ° 78-17 of January 6, 1978 modified relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter ""the Data Protection Act"") and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter ""the GDPR"" or ""the Regulation""). 6. The online report of findings no. 2020-128-1, drawn up following the inspection and notified to the companies MICROSOFT CORPORATION, MIOL and MICROSOFT FRANCE on October 15, 2020, invited the companies to answer several questions relating to in particular on the identification of the entity which determines the purposes and methods of implementation of the processing of personal data relating to targeted advertising on the various domains visited during the control and accessible from the domain ""bing.com "", as well as the purpose of each of the cookies mentioned in the minutes. 7. On November 13, 2020, MICROSOFT FRANCE sent response elements to the CNIL. 8. On February 4, 2021, the company MICROSOFT FRANCE was heard and provided answers to the questions posed by the delegation, relating in particular to the relations between the companies MICROSOFT FRANCE, MICROSOFT CORPORATION and MIOL, to the organization of data protection of a personal nature within MICROSOFT and the responsibility for the processing of targeted advertising linked to the Bing search engine. On February 16, 2021, MICROSOFT FRANCE sent additional response elements. 9. On May 11, 2021, a second online check was carried out by a delegation from the CNIL. During this check, the delegation followed the following path in order to identify whether cookies are placed on the user's equipment: - the delegation visited the ""bing.com"" domain; - then, without clicking on any of the buttons or links that appear on the cookie management banner (entitled ""Accept"" or ""More options"" or ""Privacy statement""), they continued browsing the engine search before being blocked by a pop-up window; - finally, the delegation clicked on the ""Privacy statement"" and ""More options"" links located on the pop-up window. From the ""more options"" link, the delegation authorized the deposit of cookies on its terminal by clicking on the ""Allow all"" button. 10. The delegation of control asked the companies MICROSOFT FRANCE, MICROSOFT CORPORATION and MIOL, as part of the online report of findings drawn up at the end of the control, for additional details on the purposes of each of the cookies mentioned in said minutes and explanations as to the triggering of the advertising purpose of the ""MUID"" cookie. 11. On July 12 and August 31, 2021, on the basis of information provided by MIOL, MICROSOFT FRANCE provided additional response elements to the requests made by the delegation. 12. For the purpose of examining these elements, the President of the Commission, on December 23, 2021, appointed Mr François PELLEGRINI as rapporteur on the basis of Article 39 of Decree No. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 . 13. On March 30, 2022, the board of the company MIOL communicated to the CNIL a bailiff's report of March 29, 2022 noting the update of the banner relating to cookies. 14. On July 13, 2022, the rapporteur notified MIOL of a report detailing the breach of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act that he considered constituted in this case. This report proposed that the Restricted Committee impose an administrative fine on the company, as well as an injunction, accompanied by a penalty, to stop depositing the ""MUID"" cookie subject to the collection of the consent of persons residing in France when they arrive on the ""bing.com"" website, even before they have had the opportunity to make a choice as to the operations for accessing or entering information in their terminal. It also proposed that the sanction decision be made public, but that it would no longer be possible to identify the company by name after the expiry of a period of two years from its publication. 15. On September 9, 2022, the company filed its observations in response to the sanction report. 16. On September 22, 2022, the board of the company MIOL sent a letter to the CNIL, demonstrating the update of the preference management center of the cookie banner of the ""bing.com"" website. 17. The rapporteur responded to the company's observations on October 10, 2022. 18. On November 15, 2022, the company produced new observations in response to those of the rapporteur. 19. By letter dated November 16, 2022, the rapporteur informed the company's board that the investigation was closed, pursuant to Article 40, III, of amended decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019. 20. By letter dated November 16, 2022, the company was informed that the file was on the agenda of the restricted meeting of December 1, 2022. 21. The rapporteur and the company presented oral observations during the session of the Restricted Committee. II. Reasons for decision A. On the processing in question and the competence of the CNIL 1. On the material competence of the CNIL and the non-application of the ""one-stop shop"" mechanism provided for by the GDPR 22. The processing covered by this procedure, relating to the deposit of cookies and tracers on the terminal of users residing in France when using the Bing search engine, is carried out in the context of the provision of accessible electronic communications services to the public through a public electronic communications network offered within the European Union. As such, they fall within the material scope of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications, as amended by Directive 2006/24/EC of March 15, 2006 and by Directive 2009/136/EC of November 25, 2009 (hereinafter the “ePrivacy” Directive). 23. Article 5(3) of that directive, relating to the storage of or access to information already stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user, was transposed into national law at the Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, within Chapter IV of the law relating to the Rights and obligations specific to processing in the electronic communications sector. 24. Under the terms of Article 16 of the Data Protection Act, ""the restricted committee takes measures and pronounces sanctions against data controllers or subcontractors who do not comply with the obligations arising \[…\] of this law"". Under Article 20, paragraph III, of this same law, ""when the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from \[…\] this law, the president of the National Commission for Computing and freedoms \[…\] can seize the restricted formation "". 25. The rapporteur considers that the CNIL is materially competent to control and sanction the operations of access or registration of information implemented by the company in the terminals of users of the ""bing.com"" domain residing in France. 26. In defence, the company did not comment on the jurisdiction of the CNIL 27. The Restricted Committee recalls that the Council of State, in its decision Société GOOGLE LLC and société GOOGLE IRELAND LIMITED of January 28, 2022, confirmed that the control of operations for accessing or registering information in the terminals of users in France of an electronic communications service, even if processing cross-border, falls within the jurisdiction of the CNIL and that the one-stop-shop system provided for by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter ""the GDPR"") is not applicable: ""it has not been provided for the application of the so-called ""one-stop shop"" mechanism applicable to cross-border processing, defined in article 56 of this regulation, for the measures for the implementation and monitoring of Directive 2002/58/EC of 12 July 2002, which fall within the competence of the national supervisory authorities by virtue of Article 15a of this directive. it follows that, with regard to the control operations for accessing and recording information in the terminals of users in France of an electronic communications service, even if proceeding from cross-border processing, the measures for monitoring the application of the provisions having transposed the objectives of directive 2002/58/EC fall within the competence conferred on the CNIL by the law of January 6, 1978 \[…\]"" (EC, 10th and 9th chambers combined, January 28, 2022, company GOOGLE LLC and company GOOGLE IRELAND LIMITED, no. 449209, pt. 12). The Council of State very recently reaffirmed this position in a judgment of June 27, 2022 (CE, 10th and 9th chambers combined, June 27, 2022, company AMAZON EUROPE CORE, n° 451423). 28. Therefore, the Restricted Committee considers that the CNIL is competent to initiate a sanction procedure concerning the processing implemented by the company falling within the scope of the ""ePrivacy"" Directive, provided that the processing relates to its territorial jurisdiction. 2. On the territorial jurisdiction of the CNIL 29. The rule of territorial application of the requirements set out in Article 82 of the Data Protection Act is specified in Article 3, paragraph I, of the same law which provides: ""without prejudice, with regard to the processing falling within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, of the criteria provided for in Article 3 of this regulation, all the provisions of this law apply to the processing of personal data carried out in the framework of the activities of an establishment of a data controller \[…\] on French territory, whether or not the processing takes place in France”. 30. The rapporteur considers that the CNIL has territorial jurisdiction pursuant to these provisions since the processing, subject of this procedure, consisting of operations to access or register information in the terminal of users residing in France , when browsing the ""bing.com"" website, is carried out within the ""framework of the activities"" of the company MICROSOFT FRANCE, which constitutes the ""establishment"" on French territory of the company MIOL. 31. In defence, the company made no observations on this point. 32. Firstly, with regard to the existence of an establishment of the data controller on French territory, the Restricted Committee recalls that the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter the ""CJEU"") has consistently considered that the concept of establishment should be assessed in a flexible manner and that to this end, it was necessary to assess both the degree of stability of the installation and the reality of the exercise of activities in another State member, taking into account the specific nature of the economic activities and the provision of services in question (see, for example, CJEU, Weltimmo, 1 Oct. 2015, C 230/14, pts. 30 and 31). The CJEU also considers that a company, an autonomous legal person, from the same group as the controller, can constitute an establishment of the controller within the meaning of these provisions (CJEU, 13 May 2014, Google Spain, C-131/ 12, point 48). 33. In this case, the Restricted Committee notes, first of all, that MICROSOFT FRANCE is the headquarters of the French subsidiary of MICROSOFT CORPORATION. It notes the existence of a program entitled ""Resident Guest Employee"", allowing a person working in an entity other than MICROSOFT CORPORATION to be contractually employed by the local entity but dependent, hierarchically and in the tasks it performs, from another entity of the MICROSOFT group. MICROSOFT FRANCE specified that in this case, several people in the team responsible for managing advertising for the Bing search engine, namely the Microsoft Advertising team which reports to MIOL, are employees of MICROSOFT FRANCE and deal with the French market. 34. Secondly, with regard to the existence of processing carried out ""in the context of the activities"" of this establishment, the Restricted Committee notes that, in its AMAZON EUROPE CORE decision of June 27, 2022, the Board of State recalled that ""it follows from the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, in particular from its judgment of 5 June 2018, Unabhängiges Landeszentrum für Datenschutz Schleswig-Holstein v Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein GmbH (C-210/16 ), that in view of the objective pursued by this directive \[the ""e-Privacy"" directive\], consisting in ensuring effective and complete protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to protection of privacy and the protection of personal data, processing of personal data may be regarded as carried out ""in the context of the activities"" of a national establishment not only if this establishment itself intervenes in the implementation of this processing, but also in the case where the latter is limited to ensuring, on the territory of a Member State, the promotion and sale of advertising space making it possible to make profitable the services offered by the person responsible for a processing consisting in collecting personal data through connection tracers installed on the terminals of visitors to a site"" (CE, 10th and 9th chambers combined, June 27, 2022, company AMAZON EUROPE CORE, n° 451423, pt . 10). The Council of State considered in this same decision that this was the case when the activities of the establishment of the data controller consist of the promotion and marketing of advertising tools controlled and operated by the data controller operating in particular thanks to the data collected through connection tracers deposited on the terminals of users of the site operated by the data controller (pt. 15 of the aforementioned decision). 35. In the present case, the Restricted Committee notes that the operations of accessing or entering information in the terminal of users located in France, when using the Bing search engine, are intrinsically linked to the activities of the company MICROSOFT FRANCE. Indeed, the company MIOL operates and develops in the European Economic Area (EEA) the Bing search engine, on which advertising space is purchased by advertisers, the promotion of these advertising tools being ensured, for the French market, by part of the Microsoft Advertising team. 36. Thus, the processing consisting of operations of access or registration of information in the terminal of users residing in France, when using the Bing search engine, is indeed carried out ""within the framework of the activities"" of the company MICROSOFT FRANCE. The Restricted Committee notes that the two criteria provided for in Article 3, paragraph I, of the Data Protection Act are therefore met. 37. It follows that French law is applicable and that the CNIL is materially and territorially competent to exercise its powers, including that of imposing sanctions concerning processing falling within the scope of the ""ePrivacy"" directive. B. On the determination of the controller 38. The Restricted Committee notes, first of all, that Article 4, paragraph 7, of the GDPR is applicable to this procedure because of the use of the concept of ""data controller"" in Article 82 of the Law Computing and Liberties, which is justified by the reference made by article 2 of the ""ePrivacy"" directive to directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data, which has been replaced by the GDPR. 39. According to Article 4(7) of the GDPR, the controller is “the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing"". 40. The rapporteur considers that the company MIOL acts as controller of the processing in question, in that it determines the purposes and means of the processing consisting of operations of access or registration of information in the terminal of the users residing in France when using the Bing search engine. 41. The company did not submit any observations on this point. 42. The Restricted Committee points out that, in its letter of November 13, 2020, the company MICROSOFT FRANCE, which communicates ""on the basis of the information which \[it\] was communicated by Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited"", mentioned the role of MIOL in as controller of the data processing carried out from the ""bing.com"" domain for users in the EEA, the United Kingdom and Switzerland and specified that MIOL exercised a decisive influence on the purposes and methods of implementation of processing and in particular processing relating to targeted advertising. Finally, the Restricted Committee notes that these comments were confirmed by MICROSOFT FRANCE during the hearing of February 4, 2021. 43. It follows from the foregoing that the company MIOL determines the purposes and means of the processing consisting of access operations or registration of information in the terminal of users residing in France, when using the engine of Bing search, and therefore acts as the controller in question. C. On the breach of cookie obligations 44. Under the terms of article 82 of the Data Protection Act, transposing article 5, paragraph 3, of the ""ePrivacy"" directive, ""any subscriber or user of an electronic communications service must be clearly informed and complete, unless it has been completed beforehand, by the controller or his representative: 1° The purpose of any action seeking to access, by electronic transmission, information already stored in its electronic communications terminal equipment, or to enter information in this equipment; 2° The means at his disposal to oppose it. This access or registration can only take place on condition that the subscriber or user has expressed, after having received this information, his consent which may result from appropriate parameters of his connection device or any other device placed under his control. These provisions are not applicable if the access to information stored in the user's terminal equipment or the registration of information in the user's terminal equipment: 1° Either, has the exclusive purpose of allowing or facilitating communication by electronic means; 2° Either, is strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user"". 1. On the obligation to obtain the user's consent to the deposit and reading of cookies has. Regarding the deposit of a cookie on the user's terminal before any action on his part, without obtaining his consent 45. In his report, the rapporteur notes that the checks carried out revealed that upon arrival on the bing.com site, before any action on the part of the user, the ""MUID"" cookie was placed on the terminal of the user. According to the information communicated by MIOL within the framework of the control procedure, this is a multi-purpose cookie used to ensure the security of the service, to measure the use of the website and for the presentation of advertisements. . The company indicated that a mechanism for collecting consent made it possible to trigger the advertising purposes of this cookie. The company nevertheless specified that when the advertising purpose of this cookie was not activated, it was used for the detection and filtering of advertising fraud concerning non-targeted advertising. The rapporteur notes that cookies relating to the detection and filtering of advertising fraud are part of the broader purpose of contextual advertising, which covers all advertising techniques consisting in offering advertising content according to the context in which the individual exposed to the message. He considers that these cookies are therefore not exclusively intended to allow or facilitate communication by electronic means and cannot be regarded as strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user. 'user. The rapporteur thus considers that the company MIOL disregards the obligations of article 82 of the law ""Informatique et Libertés"" by depositing this cookie without the consent of the user. 46. In defense, the company explains that the ""MUID"" cookie is a multi-purpose cookie, used for essential and non-essential purposes to avoid using several cookies each for one purpose, in order to reduce the number of reads and writes information between the user's terminal and ""bing.com"". The company indicates that only essential purposes are activated before the user gives consent. The company asserts that it considers as purposes essential to the functionality of ""bing.com"": the purposes of combating fraud, including advertising fraud, security purposes such as the prevention of denial of service attacks, malware detection and countering misinformation. The company maintains that these inseparable purposes are strictly necessary for the provision of ""bing.com"" services as requested by the user. The company specifies that in the absence of user consent, the only advertising purpose for which the ""MUID"" cookie is used is non-targeted advertising as part of the fight against advertising fraud. 47. In his answer, the rapporteur recalls that, when the advertising purpose of the ""MUID"" cookie was not activated, this cookie was nevertheless used for the detection and filtering of advertising fraud concerning non-targeted advertising. It therefore considers that the deposit of this cookie requires the prior consent of the user for this purpose. In addition, the rapporteur specifies, in response to the company's argument considering the purpose of combating fraud in the broad sense as an essential purpose exempt from consent, that only the purpose of combating denial of service attacks could be exempt from consent. The rapporteur notes that the other purposes mentioned do not fall within the scope of the exemptions provided for in Article 82 of the Data Protection Act since they are not intended to facilitate electronic communication and are not strictly necessary for the provision of a service expressly requested by the user. 48. The company, in its final submissions, argues that the purposes of detecting malware and combating misinformation and advertising fraud are strictly necessary for the provision of the ""bing.com"" service, a service which produces search results relevant, reliable and safe. The company maintains that the term service should be interpreted with reference to a user's legitimate expectations, as well as the provider's legal obligations, regarding integrity, quality and security. It maintains that in any case, once the ""MUID"" cookie is placed on the user's terminal for an essential purpose, article 82 of the Data Protection Act does not apply to subsequent uses. by the company of the personal data stored in the cookie. In this sense, the company concludes that the fight against misinformation, fraud, spam and abuse is compatible with the prevention of denial of service attacks, cybercrime, load balancing and session-to-session continuity. in accordance with Article 6(4) of the GDPR. The company also argues that in this case, compliance with GDPR requirements would then be overseen by the Data Protection Commission, Ireland's data protection authority, under the GDPR's one-stop shop, not the CNIL. 49. Firstly, with regard to cookies and other multi-purpose trackers, the Restricted Committee recalls that Article 82 of the Data Protection Act requires consent to the operations of reading and writing information in the terminal of a user but provides for specific cases in which certain tracers benefit from an exemption to consent: either when the latter has the exclusive purpose of allowing or facilitating communication by electronic means or when it is strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user. The Restricted Committee notes by way of illustration that the Commission specifies, in its guidelines of September 17, 2020, that ""the use of the same tracer for several purposes, some of which do not fall within the scope of these exemptions, requires obtain the prior consent of the persons concerned, under the conditions set out in these guidelines. For example, in the case of a service offered via a platform requiring user authentication (""logged-in universe""), the publisher of the service may use a cookie to authenticate users without asking for their consent (because this cookie is strictly necessary for the provision of the online communication service). On the other hand, it may not use this same cookie for advertising purposes other than if the latter have actually consented beforehand to this specific purpose"". 50. The Restricted Committee thus considers that, if a multi-purpose cookie can be deposited without consent for an essential purpose which falls under one of the two exemptions provided for in Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, the company cannot use this cookie for non-essential purposes only if the user has actually consented to these specific purposes prior to registering in their terminal, contrary to what the company maintains. Indeed, the Restricted Committee notes that depositing a multi-purpose cookie on the user's terminal for essential purposes exempt from obtaining consent under the exemptions provided for in Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, then having of the GDPR the subsequent processing carried out for non-essential purposes of said cookie, would amount to circumventing the provisions of the Data Protection Act since the user's consent would never again be requested prior to the deposit of cookies. With regard to the inseparability of the purposes invoked by the company, the Restricted Committee recalls that the use of a multi-purpose tracker is a flexibility left to the data controller so as not to overload the user's terminal with a multitude of tracers each corresponding to a particular purpose. 51. Secondly, the Restricted Committee considers that in order to determine whether the registration of a multi-purpose cookie, such as the ""MUID"" cookie, on the user's terminal requires the prior collection of their consent, it is necessary to determine whether among the purposes announced by the company, at least one of them requires the prior collection of consent. 52. In the present case, the Restricted Committee notes that the purpose of the ""MUID"" cookie is in particular to fight against advertising fraud, understood as all third-party practices aimed at manipulating the distribution and advertising measurement operated by the company MIOL, whether this fraud is carried out to the detriment of the MIOL company or its advertising partners. It considers that this purpose is part of the broader purpose of contextual advertising, which covers all advertising techniques consisting of offering advertising content according to the context in which the individual exposed to the message is located. The Restricted Committee considers that this purpose concerns the distribution of advertising, for the benefit of MIOL and its advertiser clients, but does not impact the provision of the search engine service to users. It notes that the company is confusing the dissemination of malicious content by the search engine's advertising services, which is part of the company's internal management, and the detection of fraud operated by bots, which makes it possible to fight against the artificial creation of clicks on advertising content or affiliate links in order to prevent robots from artificially increasing the number of views of an advertisement, and which is referred to as the fight against advertising fraud. 53. The Restricted Committee considers that cookies for this purpose do not meet any of the conditions set out for the two aforementioned exceptions, particularly since advertising is not the service requested by the user, and require the user's consent. . The Restricted Committee recalls that this position is not new since it has been supported by the CNIL since March 18, 2021 in the FAQ ""Questions and answers on the amending guidelines and the ""cookie and other tracers"" recommendation published on its site. The Restricted Committee recalls that this soft law instrument specifically indicates that cookies to combat advertising fraud are not intended to facilitate electronic communication and are not strictly necessary for the provision of a service expressly requested. by the user. 54. Given these elements and without there being any need to comment on the other purposes invoked by the company, the Restricted Committee considers that the deposit and reading of a multi-purpose cookie such as the ""MUID"" cookie "" on the user's terminal, at least for the purpose of combating advertising fraud as defined in paragraphs 52 and 53, require the user to give his prior consent, under the conditions provided for in article 82 of the Data Protection Act, as clarified by Article 4, paragraph 11, of the GDPR. 55. The Restricted Committee thus considers that by allowing, on the day of the online check of May 11, 2021, the deposit and reading of this cookie on the user's terminal when he arrives on the ""bing.com"" site without first obtaining its consent, the company MIOL has disregarded the obligations of article 82 of the Data Protection Act. b. Regarding the deposit of a cookie on the user's terminal after navigation without obtaining his consent 56. The rapporteur notes that the online check of 11 May 2021 revealed that the ""ABDEF"" cookie was placed on the user's terminal after continuing to browse, without the user's consent having been given. collected. According to the information provided by the company as part of the control procedure, the ""ABDEF"" cookie has an advertising purpose. The rapporteur therefore considered that the MIOL company disregarded the obligations of article 82 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law by depositing this cookie, without the consent of the user, whereas cookies and other tracers for advertising purposes do not not part of the cookies exempt from consent under the aforementioned article. In addition, the rapporteur noted that, after the online check, the company indicated that this cookie had been added inadvertently and that it would rectify this error before July 30, 2021 by placing it only after having obtained the user consent. 57. In defense, the company indicates that it had incorrectly categorized the ""ABDEF"" cookie due to simple human inadvertence and that the latter was only placed for a short period since, since July 30, 2021, this cookie is now subject to the collection of user consent. The company invokes a ""right to error"" and explains that it acted in perfect good faith since it would have itself indicated its error to the CNIL by declaring in complete transparency, by letter dated July 12, 2021, that this cookie had been inadvertently added to the site. 58. The Restricted Committee notes that the letter of July 12, 2021 in which the company admitted having incorrectly categorized the ""ABDEF"" cookie is a response to the question posed by the delegation of control in the context of the minutes drawn up at the from the online check of May 11, 2021, ""Specify the purposes of the cookies whose deposit could be noted in the PV n° 2020-128/3 of May 11, 2021"". The Restricted Committee considers that, if the deposit of the ""ABDEF"" cookie without obtaining the consent of the user was not intentional, it nevertheless resulted from a gross error on the part of the company which did not dispute the purpose advertising of said cookie. In addition, it was only following the check carried out by the Commission that MIOL noticed its error and put an end to it. 59. The Restricted Committee considers that by allowing, on the day of the online check of May 11, 2021, the deposit and reading of the ""ABDEF"" cookie on the user's terminal after browsing the ""bing.com"" site without obtain its consent beforehand, the company MIOL has disregarded the obligations of article 82 of the law ""Informatique et Libertés"", cookies and other tracers for advertising purposes are not part of the cookies exempt from consent under the aforementioned article . 2. On the conditions for obtaining consent 60. In law, the ""ePrivacy"" directive provides in its article 2, f), that the consent of a user or subscriber corresponds to the consent of the data subject set out in Directive 95/46/EC, to which replaced the GDPR. 61. Thus, since the entry into force of the GDPR, the ""consent"" provided for in the aforementioned Article 82 must be understood within the meaning of Article 4, paragraph 11, of the GDPR, that is to say that 'it must be given in a free, specific, enlightened and unequivocal manner and manifest itself in a clear positive act. 62. In this respect, recital 42 of this Regulation provides that ""consent should not be considered to have been given freely if the data subject does not have a real freedom of choice or is not in a position to refuse or to withdraw consent without prejudice"". 63. The CNIL considers that it follows from these combined provisions, as it interpreted them in its deliberation no. 2020-091 of September 17, 2020 adopting guidelines relating to the application of Article 82 of the law of 6 January 1978 amended to read and/or write operations in a user's terminal (in particular to ""cookies and other tracers"") and n° 2020-092 adopting a recommendation proposing practical methods of compliance in the event of the use of ""cookies and other tracers"", that it must be as easy to refuse or withdraw consent to tracers as to give it. The Restricted Committee recalls that although these instruments are certainly not mandatory, they aim to interpret the applicable legislative provisions and to enlighten the players on the implementation of concrete measures to guarantee compliance with the legal provisions, so that they implement these measures or measures having equivalent effect. In this sense, it is specified in the guidelines that the main purpose of these ""is to recall and explain the law applicable to the operations of reading and/or writing information \[…\] in the terminal equipment electronic communications of the subscriber or user, and in particular the use of cookies"". Therefore, the Restricted Committee recalls that it retains a breach of the obligations arising from Article 82 of the Data Protection Act and not the non-compliance with the recommendations which constitute relevant insight to shed light on the obligations provided for by European legislators and French, in particular by drawing all the consequences of the principle of freedom of consent as defined in Article 4, paragraph 11, of the GDPR, and by applying them to the assumptions of acceptance and refusal by the user to the deposit of cookies on his terminal. Indeed, this principle of freedom of consent implies that the user benefits from a ""true freedom of choice"", as underlined in recital 42 of the GDPR, and therefore that the methods offered to him to express this choice are not biased. in favor of consent. 64. With regard to the possible refusal procedures, in this same recommendation, the Commission ""strongly recommended that the mechanism making it possible to express a refusal to consent to read and/or write operations be accessible on the same screen and with the same ease as the mechanism allowing consent to be expressed. Indeed, it considers that consent collection interfaces which require a single click to consent to tracking while several actions are necessary to ""parameterize"" a refusal to consent present , in most cases, the risk of biasing the choice of the user, who wishes to be able to view the site or use the application quickly. For example, at the stage of the first level of information, users can have the choice between two buttons presented at the same level and in the same format, on which are written respectively ""accept all"" and ""reject all"", ""authorize"" and ""prohibit"", or ""consent"" and ""not consent"", or any other equivalent and sufficiently clear wording. The Commission considers that this modality constitutes a simple and clear way to allow the user to express his refusal as easily as his consent"". 65. The rapporteur noted that on the day of the online check of 11 May 2021, while the banner displayed on the ""bing.com"" website contained a button allowing cookies to be accepted immediately, no similar means were offered to the user to be able to refuse, easily and with a single click, the deposit of these cookies. He had to perform at least two actions (perform a first click on ""More options"", leave the sliding buttons pre-checked on ""Disable"" by default, then perform a click on ""Save settings"") to refuse cookies against a single action to accept them. Such a mechanism therefore did not offer, according to the rapporteur, the same ease as that allowing consent to be expressed, in disregard of the legal requirements of freedom of consent, which imply not encouraging the Internet user to accept cookies rather than to refuse them. The rapporteur also notes that before the modification of the terms in the preference management center made on September 22, 2022, the presentation of the window allowing the user to refuse cookies could be ambiguous due to the use of the infinitive – ""Disable"" – which in principle implies that an action must be taken. The rapporteur therefore considered that the conditions for obtaining consent implemented by the company MIOL on the ""bing.com"" website did not comply with the provisions of article 82 of the Data Protection Act as explained by article 4, paragraph 11, of the GDPR on the freedom of consent, at the time of the online control from May 11, 2021 and until March 29, 2022, the date on which the company implemented a ""Reject all"" button . 66. In defence, the company argues that neither the ""ePrivacy"" directive, nor its transposition into French law in article 82 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law, nor the GDPR, provide for the rule according to which it must be as easy to refuse cookies as it is to accept them. It argues that the CNIL's recommendation of September 17, 2020 is not binding. The company considers in this respect that the CNIL accepts the presentation of a less easily accessible or less visible button to refuse the registration of cookies. The company maintains that the length of the implementation times, the tests and the technical and commercial consequences on the activity of its search engine justified it waiting for the final decision of the Council of State to avoid yet another modification of his cookie banner. 67. The company also explains that before the implementation of this ""Refuse all"" button, it relied on a preference management center and explicit consent from its users for the use of non-essential cookies and that no non-essential cookies were placed on users' terminals before they clicked the ""Accept"" button. It thus considers that the user refused to consent to non-essential cookies when he refrained from clicking on the ""Accept"" button and continued browsing or by clicking on ""Save settings"" after visiting the preference center by clicking on ""More options"", and that it was thus as easy to refuse as to consent to read and/or write operations. MIOL therefore considers that the user could accept or refuse the deposit of cookies in a very simple way and each time according to two methods, thus ensuring a free choice. 68. Firstly, the Restricted Committee notes that, if the company MIOL today argues that the lack of choice expressed by the user had the effect of not registering any non-essential cookies on his terminal, the banner of The information displayed to the user did not contain any such information. 69. The Restricted Committee considers, as the Commission recalled in its aforementioned guidelines, that if the user's refusal to consent to cookies can be deduced from his silence, it is on condition that the user be fully informed. Otherwise, the balance between the terms of acceptance and refusal is not respected. However, this was not the case in this case: by viewing the banner, the user was not informed of the means at his disposal to not simply consent to cookies. 70. The Restricted Committee considers, on the contrary, that it was not intuitive for the user to consider that by continuing to browse without performing any action on the cookie banner, no cookie would be deposited. It also notes that, if such navigation without action on the banner was indeed possible, as the delegation of control noted during the online check carried out on May 11, 2021, a choice was imposed concerning the deposit of cookies after three searches from the search engine, through a pop-up window with an ""Accept"" button and a ""More options"" button. Therefore, the simplest choice for an Internet user was to accept cookies via the ""Accept"" button. Thus, the Restricted Committee considers that in the absence of information on the consequences of his inaction, the user wishing to refuse cookies was strongly encouraged to click on the ""More options"" button and then to perform the two actions described. above. 71. In addition, the Restricted Committee notes the inexplicit nature of the ""More options"" button offered in the context of the first window, which did not clearly mention the existence of means for refusing cookies as well as the ambiguity the use of the infinitive ""Disable"" in the context of the second window, which could lead the user to believe that cookies were by default authorized. It considers that the fact that the cookies were not deposited has no impact on the confusion generated by the information path which could give the user the feeling that it was not possible to refuse the deposit of cookies and that it did not have any control methods in this regard or to be mistaken when deactivating these cookies. 72. Secondly, the Restricted Committee notes that it appears from several studies that the organizations which have set up a ""Refuse all"" button on the consent collection interface at the first level have seen the rate of consent relating to the acceptance of cookies decrease. Thus, according to the ""Privacy barometer - 2021 edition"" published by the company COMMANDERS ACT, the rate of consent on computers fell from 70% to 55% in April-May 2021, since the collection of consent is explicit. Similarly, according to a 366-Kantar study, it appears that 41% of Internet users in France refused, systematically or partially, the deposit of cookies in June 2021. 73. The Restricted Committee also considers that making the mechanism for refusing cookies more complex than that consisting in accepting them amounts in reality to discouraging users from refusing cookies and encouraging them to favor the ease of the ""Accept"" button. "". Indeed, an Internet user is generally led to consult many sites. Internet browsing is characterized by its speed and fluidity. Having to click on ""More options"" and having to understand how the page to refuse cookies is constructed is likely to discourage the user, who would nevertheless wish to refuse the deposit of cookies. It is not disputed that in this case, the company offered a choice between accepting or refusing cookies before the insertion of the ""Refuse all"" button, but the methods by which this refusal could be expressed, in the context of Internet browsing, biased the expression of choice in favor of consent in such a way as to alter the freedom of choice. 74. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Committee considers that a breach of the provisions of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, interpreted in the light of the GDPR, is constituted, insofar as, at the time of the control online from May 11, 2021 and until the implementation of a ""Deny all"" button on March 29, 2022, the user did not have the possibility to refuse read and/or write operations with the same degree of simplicity that he had in accepting them. III. On corrective measures and their publicity 75. Under the terms of article 20, III, of the amended law of January 6, 1978, ""When the data controller or its processor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or of this law, the president of the National Commission for Computing and Liberties may also, if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, if necessary in addition to a remains provided for in II, seize the restricted formation of the committee with a view to the pronouncement, after adversarial procedure, of one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 2° An injunction to bring the processing into compliance with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or from this law or to satisfy the requests presented by the person concerned with a view to exercising their rights, which may be accompanied, except in cases where the processing is implemented by the State, with a penalty payment the amount of which may not exceed €100,000 per day of delay from the date set by the restricted body; \[…\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the annual worldwide turnover total for the previous year, whichever is higher. \[…\] The Restricted Committee takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same Article 83"". 76. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that ""each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this Article for breaches of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case , effective, proportionate and dissuasive"", before specifying the elements to be taken into account to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide on the amount of this fine. A. On the pronouncement of an administrative fine and its amount 77. The company considers that the proposed administrative fine is disproportionate to the alleged breaches and its conduct, to the fragile position of ""bing.com"" in the search engine market dominated by a single player, to the essential role that ""bing.com"" plays by offering an alternative to French users and the small proportion by which ""bing.com"" contributes to its financial results. 78. The Restricted Committee recalls that Article 20, paragraph III, of the Data Protection Act gives it jurisdiction to impose various sanctions, in particular administrative fines, the maximum amount of which may be equivalent to 2% of the annual worldwide turnover. total of the previous financial year carried out by the data controller or 10 million euros. It adds that the determination of the amount of these fines is assessed in the light of the criteria specified by Article 83 of the GDPR. 79. Firstly, the Restricted Committee stresses that it is appropriate, in this case, to apply the criterion provided for in subparagraph a) of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the GDPR relating to the seriousness of the breach. taking into account the scope of the processing and the number of data subjects. 80. The Restricted Committee notes that by not complying with the requirements of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, the company deprives users of the ""bing.com"" search engine residing in France of the possibility of choosing methods preserving the confidentiality of their data and methods allowing better personalization of the service offered to them, thus reducing their informational autonomy. Furthermore, the absence of prior consent to the deposit of cookies upon the arrival of users residing in France on the ""bing.com"" website and during their navigation on the latter, constitutes a substantial infringement of the right to respect for the privacy of the persons concerned. Finally, the imbalance between the methods offered to the user to accept or refuse the deposit of cookies on his terminal does not allow him to benefit from a real freedom of choice. 81. The Restricted Committee also notes the massive nature of the processing. She recalls that the company indicated that the Bing search engine had nearly 11 million unique visitors in France for the month of September 2020, i.e. one sixth of the French population. The number of people affected by the processing in question is therefore significant on the scale of the French population. 82. In addition, the Restricted Committee notes that it appears from publicly available information that the Bing search engine is the leading competitor to that offered by Google, although it represents only 5% of the market share in average number query monthly. The Restricted Committee also notes that the ""bing.com"" search engine is used by default for queries made within Windows operating systems. The Restricted Committee notes that, in fact, the search engine user base is extended beyond the single segment of web browsing software. 83. Secondly, the Restricted Committee considers that it is appropriate to apply the criterion provided for in subparagraph k) of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the Rules relating to the financial benefits obtained as a result of the breach and any other circumstance. 84. The Restricted Committee recalls that the deposit of the ""MUID"" cookie on the terminal of users in France, before any action on their part and without their consent for the purposes of combating advertising fraud is contextual advertising. The Restricted Committee also notes that the deposit of the ""ABDEF"" cookie on the terminal of users in France, after navigation and without their consent, as well as the absence of a similar means of refusing cookies than of accepting them, have direct consequences on the use of cookies for non-essential purposes relating to personalized advertising. 85. In this respect, the Restricted Committee notes that the clients of the Microsoft Advertising team for the French public, such as \[…\] buy advertising space on the Bing search engine and collaborate with the Microsoft Advertising team in order to target local audiences and thus offer the most relevant advertisements. The Restricted Committee notes that the display of personalized advertisements to an Internet user is only possible if the navigation of the latter could be traced using a tracer, in order to determine which content would be the most relevant to display. In addition, the Restricted Committee points out that it emerges from the studies mentioned above that the companies which have set up a ""Refuse all"" button on the consent collection interface have seen the consent rate relating to the acceptance decrease in cookies, since a large proportion of Internet users completely or partially refuse cookies and other tracers, which necessarily has an impact in terms of revenue linked to online advertising. Thus, the Restricted Committee considers that the processing in question carried out by the company MIOL – consisting of operations to access or register information in the terminal of users residing in France when using the Bing search engine, without implementing a mechanism for refusing consent as easy as that of accepting cookies until March 2022 – participates in this respect in generating advertising revenue in France, for the benefit of the company's activity. 86. Although the placement of cookies for advertising purposes is not the main source of income for the company, which indicates that it derives most of its profits from the resale of equipment, marketing and licensing and distribution software, the Restricted Committee notes that invoiced advertising revenue relating to the ""bing.com"" domain and generated in France, which rose from \[…\] in 2020 to \[…\] in 2021, shows an increase of \[...\] %. 87. The Restricted Committee also notes that the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries which are publicly available show that advertising constitutes one of the major economic models of the Microsoft group. The group's 2021 annual report thus mentions that its gross margin increased by 10% in 2021 thanks, in particular, to the advertising sector. 88. In addition, the Restricted Committee recalls the context in which the MIOL company chose not to offer its users, on the ""bing.com"" search engine, the option of easily refusing cookies until March 2022. Indeed, the CNIL has implemented a compliance plan on the issue of cookies spread over several years. The CNIL has communicated publicly on its website, on several occasions, on the fact that it must be as easy for the Internet user to refuse cookies as to accept them. This was the case in particular on October 1, 2020, when the aforementioned guidelines and recommendation of September 17, 2020 were published. Compliance was to take place by April 1, 2021. Hundreds of thousands of players, from the smallest sites to the largest, have complied and introduced a ""Refuse"" or ""Continue without accepting"". 89. The Restricted Committee also notes that before the online check of May 11, 2021, a first online check had been carried out by the delegation on September 29, 2020, and that a hearing of the company MICROSOFT FRANCE had been organized on 4 February 2021 with the delegation. In this sense, the Restricted Committee notes that MIOL was warned that the search engine was expected to be brought into compliance by the CNIL, that cookies were deposited when consent was necessary and that it had the necessary time in particular to set up a compliant means of obtaining the consent of users. 90. The Restricted Committee notes, however, that it was not until March 29, 2022 that the company chose to insert a ""Refuse all"" button, following the appointment of a rapporteur by the President of the Commission. 91. Finally, the Restricted Committee recalls that pursuant to the provisions of Article 20, paragraph III, of the Data Protection Act, the company MIOL incurs a financial penalty of a maximum amount of 2% of its turnover. of business or €10 million, whichever is greater. Given the company's turnover amounting to \[…\] in 2021, the maximum amount of the fine incurred in the present case therefore amounts to more than \[…\]. 92. Therefore, with regard to the liability of the company, its financial capacity and the relevant criteria of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the Rules mentioned above, the Restricted Committee considers that a fine of sixty million euros against MICROSOFT IRELAND OPERATIONS LIMITED appears justified. B. On the issuance of an injunction 93. The rapporteur proposed to the Restricted Committee, in its initial report, to issue a compliance injunction relating to the conditions under which the ""MUID"" cookie is placed on the user's terminal, accompanied by a penalty payment of one amount of sixty thousand euros per day of delay and payable at the end of a period of three months. 94. The company submits that the issuance of an injunction is not necessary. 95. Firstly, the Restricted Committee notes that the company MIOL continues to deposit on the terminal of the user residing in France, before any action, the multi-purpose cookie ""MUID"" which requires the collection of consent, as a it serves the purpose of combating advertising fraud. It therefore considers it necessary to issue an injunction so that the company complies with the applicable obligations in this area. 96. Secondly, the Restricted Committee recalls that the amount of the penalty payment must be both proportionate to the seriousness of the breaches committed and adapted to the financial capacities of the controller. 97. In view of these elements, the Restricted Committee considers as justified the issuance of an injunction accompanied by a penalty payment in the amount of sixty thousand euros per day of delay and liquidable at the end of a period of three months. . C. On advertising 98. The company disputes the rapporteur's proposal to make this decision public. It considers that the publication of the sanction would have significant and disproportionate consequences in terms of image and reputation. To justify this request for publicity, the rapporteur invokes in particular the number of people concerned and the nature of the breach established in this case. 99. The Restricted Committee considers that the publication of this decision is justified in view of the seriousness of the breaches in question, the scope of the processing and the number of persons concerned. 100. The Restricted Committee notes that this measure will make it possible to alert French users of the Bing search engine of the characterization of the breach of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act in its various branches and of the delivery of an injunction to remedy. 101. Finally, the measure is proportionate since the decision no longer identifies the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The CNIL Restricted Committee, after having deliberated, decides to: • pronounce against the company MICROSOFT IRELAND OPERATIONS LIMITED an administrative fine of sixty million euros (€60,000,000), with regard to the breach of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act; • pronounce against the company MICROSOFT IRELAND OPERATIONS LIMITED an injunction to obtain the consent of users when they arrive on the ""bing.com"" website before any operation of reading and writing information on the terminal of resident users in France for the purpose of combating advertising fraud; • accompany the injunction with a penalty payment of sixty thousand euros (€60,000) per day of delay at the end of a period of three months following the notification of this deliberation, the supporting documents for compliance must be sent to the restricted training within this period; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. President Alexander LINDEN This decision may be appealed to the Council of State within four months of its notification."

The National Commission for Computing and Liberties (hereinafter “CNIL”) was seized, the August 19, 2020 of a complaint (no. …) relating to the transfer of personal data of the complainant, represented by the association NOYB - European Center for Digital Rights, to the United States of America, collected during his visit to the website \[…\]. 101 complaints have also been filed by NOYB in the 27 Member States of the Union European Union and the three other States of the European Economic Area (EEA) against 101 controllers who would transfer personal data to the United States United. Pursuant to the decision \[…\] of the President of the CNIL, a delegation from the CNIL carried out a control mission on documents by sending the company \[…\] a questionnaire \[…\] and a request for additional information \[…\]. The company responded by letter \[…\]. Those FRENCH REPUBLIC 3 Place de Fontenoy, TSA 80715 – 75334 PARIS CEDEX 07 – 01 53 73 22 22 – www.cnil.fr The personal data necessary for the performance of the CNIL's missions are processed in files intended for its exclusive use. Data subjects can exercise their IT rights and Freedoms by contacting the Data Protection Officer (DPO) from the CNIL via an online form or by post. For more information: www.cnil.fr/donnees-personnelles. 1, questionnaires related to the transfer of data from visitors to the French version of the site web \[…\] which integrates the Google Analytics functionality. On \[…\], the company informed the CNIL that it had made the decision to integrate the functionality Google Analytics on its website \[…\] and that the statistics obtained via Google Analytics concerned persons in several Member States of the European Union. resulting from the integration of the Google Analytics functionality on its website therefore appears cross-border within the meaning of Article 4.23.b) of the GDPR. \[…\] In accordance with Article 56 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter “GDPR” or “the Regulation”), the CNIL informed, \[…\] all European supervisory authorities without competence to act as a supervisory authority leader concerning this cross-border processing implemented by the company, competence drawn by the CNIL from the fact that the main establishment of the company is in France. \[…\] authorities are considered to be concerned within the meaning of Article 4, point 22 of the GDPR: authorities \[…\]. On 4 January 2022, under the cooperation procedure, a draft decision was submitted to the authorities concerned on the basis of Article 60 of the GDPR. This project did not give rise to relevant and reasoned objections. II. On the processing in question and the responsibility for processing It appears from the responses of \[…\] transmitted to the delegation of control that the company has integrated the Google Analytics functionality on the website \[…\] for the purposes of audience measurement and performance of the company's media campaigns. The company clarified that Google Analytics allowed in particular, when the user had not refused its use, to carry out a individual follow-up. Indeed, by associating the unique identifier of a user to the this user's data from one or more sessions launched from one or more multiple devices, Google Analytics provides a more accurate user count (by identifying a user as a separate user, even in a different session). \[…\] Google Analytics works by including a block of JavaScript code on the pages of a website. When the user of a site visits a page, this JavaScript code causes the loading a JavaScript file and then performs the tracking operation for Google Analytics. The follow-up operation consists of retrieving data relating to the request through different means and sending this information to Google Analytics servers. Website managers who integrate the Google Analytics functionality can transmit instructions to Google for the processing of data collected via Google Analytics. These instructions are transmitted in particular through the tag management tool that they have integrated into their site and through the configuration of the tool. In fact, the manager of site can choose different parameters in order to set, for example, the retention period of data. The Google Analytics feature also allows site managers to 2, monitor and maintain the stability of their site, for example by being informed of certain events such as a peak in attendance or, on the contrary, the fact that there is no traffic on the all. Google Analytics also allows site managers to evaluate and optimize the effectiveness of advertising campaigns conducted using other Google tools. In this context, Google Analytics collects, among other things, the http request of the user, information about their browser and operating system. \[…\] an http request, for any page, contained details of the browser and terminal making the request, such as the domain name and browser information such as its type, its referent (“referer”) and its language. Google Analytics places and reads cookies on the browser of the user to allow evaluation of the user's session and other information of the page request. When this information is collected, it is transmitted to Google Analytics servers. \[…\] all of the data collected via Google Analytics was hosted in the United States. Thus, data collected on the website \[…\] via Google Analytics is transferred to United States. Regarding these transfers, it appears from the documents in the file that the contract between \[…\] concerning the Google Analytics functionality refers to an appendix entitled ""Google Ads Data Processing Terms”. This appendix contains standard contractual clauses intended to provide a framework the transfer to the United States of America of personal data in the context of Google Analytics functionality. The company indicated that it does not have in its possession elements leading to the conclusion that these clauses had not been complied with. \[…\] additional legal, organizational and technical measures to regulate data transfers as part of the Google Analytics functionality are implemented work. It emerges from all of these elements that the company managing the website \[…\], in deciding to implement the Google Analytics functionality on this site for evaluation purposes and optimization, determined the means and purposes of the collection and processing of data collected as part of the integration of Google Analytics on its website and must be considered as data controller within the meaning of article 4.7 of the GDPR. III. On the qualification of personal data It should be established that the data collected as part of the Google functionality Analytics and transferred to the United States of America constitute personal data staff. Article 4.1 of the GDPR defines personal data as ""any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as ""person concerned”); is deemed to be an ""identifiable natural person"" a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier, such as a name, identification number, location data, online identifier, or to one or more specific elements specific to its physical, physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural or social”. 3,It should be noted that online identifiers, such as IP addresses or information stored in cookies can be used as a means to identify a user, especially when combined with other similar types of information. this is illustrated by recital 30 of the GDPR which provides that an online identifier associated with a physical person, such as an IP address or a cookie, can “leave traces which, especially when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, can be used to create profiles of natural persons and to identify These persons "". In the event that the data controller claims not to have the capacity to identify the user through the use of this type of identifier (alone or combined with other data), he should demonstrate the means implemented to ensure the nature anonymous identifiers collected. In the absence of such a demonstration, these identifiers can be qualified as anonymous. Therefore, it is worth examining to what extent Google's implementation Analytics on a website allows the operator of the website \[…\] to make a person concerned (a visitor to the website in question) identifiable. In its response, \[…\] argues that the following categories of personal data are processed as part of the Google Analytics functionality: - a visitor ID (ID of the Google Analytics visitor cookie, i.e. the Google Analytics “customer ID”); - for visitors who have authenticated to the website through a user account, a internal identifier \[…\]; - the order identifiers, if applicable; - IP addresses. The company claims that IP addresses are ""anonymized"", without specifying what process is applied to make these addresses anonymous. The company, however, qualifies this personal data data. With regard to visitor identifiers, it should be noted that these are identifiers unique, which have the purpose of differentiating individuals. In this case, these identifiers can also be combined with other information, such as the address of the site visited, the browser and operating system metadata, time and data relating to the visit to the website as well as the IP address. This combination strengthens their discriminating character. This is why, several elements when they are cross-checked, can make it possible to individualize visitors to the website \[…\], on which Google Analytics is implemented. He is not necessary to know the name or postal address of the visitor since, in accordance with the recital 26 of the GDPR, such individualization of persons may be sufficient for make identifiable. Should it be decided otherwise, the scope of the right to data protection, guaranteed by Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, would be diminished. Indeed, this would allow companies to identify individuals and associate personal information with them (such as their visit to a specific website) without affording individuals protection against this individualization. Such an assessment, which would reduce the level of protection of 4, individuals, would also be contrary to the case law of the Court of Justice of the Union European Union which has repeatedly ruled that the scope of the GDPR has a definition very broad (see, for example, C‑439/19, paragraph 61). The CNIL also notes that for users of the website \[…\] who have identified themselves at through a user account, or those who made an order, the data is directly linked to identifying data. In addition, \[…\] in the context of the use of Google Analytics, and under certain conditions setting up the Google account, Google is informed that a user connected to his account Google visited a specific site. Personal data relating to this account are therefore collected. Therefore, it must be considered that the data in question must be considered as personal data within the meaning of Article 4 of the GDPR. IV. On the breach of the obligation to regulate the transfer of personal data staff outside the European Union Article 44 of the GDPR provides: “A transfer, to a third country or to an organization international, of personal data which are or are intended to be the subject of a processing after such transfer may only take place if, subject to the other provisions of the this regulation, the conditions defined in this chapter are complied with by the controllerandprocessor,includingforsubsequenttransfersofdata of a personal nature from the third country or international organization to another third country or another international organization. All provisions of this chapter are applied in such a way that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by this Regulation is not compromised. » Chapter V of the Regulation provides for various instruments to ensure a level of protection substantially equivalent to that guaranteed within the European Union, pursuant to Article 44 of this text: - adequacy decisions (Article 45); - the appropriate guarantees (Article 46); In the absence of an equivalent level of protection, it establishes derogations for situations particular (section 49). In the present case, it must be examined whether the data transfers in question to the United States of America comply with Article 44 of the Regulations and, in particular, if these transfers are based on one of the aforementioned instruments and whether appropriate measures have been adopted. 4.1 Suitability decisions In the judgment of July 16, 2020 (C-311/18), the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016, in accordance to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequacy of the protection provided by the European Union-United States Privacy Shield, without maintain its effects. 5. In the absence of another relevant adequacy decision, the transfers in question cannot not be based on Article 45 of the GDPR. 4.2 Appropriate safeguards Rule 46.1 of the Rules provides “In the absence of a decision under Rule 45, paragraph 3, the controller or processor may only transfer data of a personal nature to a third country or to an international organization only if he has planned appropriate safeguards and on condition that the data subjects have rights enforceable and effective legal remedies. » Article 46.2 of the Regulation provides that the “appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 may be provided, without this requiring specific authorization from a regulatory authority. control, by: \[…\] c) standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93, paragraph 2; "". 4.2.1 Standard data protection clauses In this case, the company and Google have entered into standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to the United States (""Google AdsDataProcessingTerms:Model Contract Clauses, Standard Contractual Clauses for Processors”). These clauses comply those published by the European Commission in its decision 2010/87/EU. In this context, it should be emphasized that the standard contractual clauses are an instrument of transfer within the meaning of Chapter V of the Rules and have not been challenged as such by the Court of Justice in its judgment of July 16, 2020 (C-311/18). However, the Court has considered that it followed from the contractual nature of these clauses that they could not bind the authorities of third countries. In particular, the Court considered that: “If there is, therefore, situations in which, depending on the state of the law and the practices in force in the third country concerned, the recipient of such a transfer is able to guarantee the protection of data necessary on the basis of the standard data protection clauses alone, there are others in which the stipulations contained in these clauses may not constitute a sufficient means of ensuring, in practice, the effective protection of personal data transferred to the third country concerned. This is the case, in particular, where the law of that third country allows the public authorities of that country to interference with the rights of data subjects relating to such data. » (C‑311/18, paragraph 126). However, it is not necessary to analyze in more detail the legal framework applicable to the United States. States of America insofar as the Court has already carried out such an analysis in the Judgment aforementioned. The Court found, first, that the surveillance programs at issue did not correspond to the minimum requirements attached, in Union law, to the principle of proportionality, so that it was not permissible to consider that the programs of supervision based on these provisions are limited to what is strictly necessary (point 184). Else hand, the Court found that the legal framework in question did not confer on persons concerned rights enforceable against the US authorities in court, so that these people did not have a right to an effective remedy (paragraph 192). The analysis of the Court of Justice is relevant in this case insofar as Google LLC (in as a data importer in the United States) must qualify as a provider of 6, electronic communications within the meaning of Section 50 US. Code § 1881(b)(4) and is, per therefore, subject to surveillance by US intelligence services, pursuant to of section 50 US. Code § 1881a (“FISA 702”). Google LLC therefore has an obligation to provide the U.S. government with such personal data as may be required by under FISA 702. It appears from Google's transparency report that Google LLC is a regular recipient such access requests by the intelligence services of the United States of America. Thus, on the one hand, the Court of Justice declared the decision on adequacy with the United States invalid. United States of America, due to the access possibilities of the American intelligence services. On the other hand, standard contractual clauses cannot, on their own, ensure a level of sufficient protection as required by Article 44 of the GDPR insofar as the guarantees that they provide are left unapplied in the event of access by said services of information. The Court of Justice drew the following conclusion: “It thus appears that the standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission under Article 46, paragraph 2(c) of the same regulation are intended solely to provide those responsible for the processing or to their subcontractors established in the Union of contractual guarantees applying in a uniform manner in all third countries and, therefore, independently of the level of protection guaranteed in each of them. Insofar as these standard clauses of data protection cannot, given their nature, provide guarantees that go beyond a contractual obligation to ensure that the level of protection required by the law of the Union is respected, they may require, depending on the situation prevailing in one or more such third country, the adoption of additional measures by the controller in order to ensure compliance with this level of protection. (item 133). 4.2.2 Adoption of additional safeguards In his recommendations 01/2020 of 18 June 2021, the EDPS clarified that when the assessment of the law or practice of the third country reveals that there are elements likely undermine the effectiveness of the appropriate safeguards offered by the transfer instrument in question in Article 46 of the GDPR to which the exporter has recourse in the context of a particular transfer – which is the case here, following the assessment carried out by the CJEU – the exporter must suspend the transfer or put in place additional measures. The EDPS notes in this regard that “(a)ny additional measure cannot be deemed effective within the meaning of the judgment of the CJEU in the Schrems II case only if and insofar as it remedies – taken in isolation or in combination with others – the shortcomings identified in the assessment of the situation law and applicable practices of the third country that the exporter has carried out. (item 75). Measures to complement the standard data protection clauses can be classified into three categories: contractual, organizational and technical (see, for this purpose, point 47 of recommendations 01/2020). With regard to contractual measures, the EDPS noted that such measures: “\[…\] can complement and reinforce the guarantees that the transfer instrument and the relevant legislation of the third country \[…\]. Given the contractual nature of the measures, which are generally not likely to bind the authorities of the third country when they are not parties to the contract, these measures should be combined with other measures technical and organizational to provide the required level of data protection. \[…\]” (paragraph 99). 7.As regards the organizational measures, the EDPS considered that the “\[…\] selection and implementation of one or more of these measures does not guarantee necessarily and systematically that the transfer will satisfy the standard of equivalence established by Union law. Depending on the specific circumstances of the transfer and evaluation of third-country legislation, organizational measures are necessary to complete the contractual and/or technical measures in order to guarantee a level of protection of personal data essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EEA” (point 128). With regard to technical measures, the EDPS underlined that these “\[…\] measures will be particularly necessary in the event that the law of that country requires the importer to data of obligations that are contrary to the guarantees offered by the instruments of transfer referred to in Article 46 of the GDPR and which are, in particular, likely to affect the contractual guarantee of an essentially equivalent level of protection against access by the public authorities of that country to that data” (point 77). He adds that ""The measures listed \[in the guidelines\] aim to ensure that access by authorities public authorities of third countries to the data transferred does not affect the effectiveness of the appropriate safeguards contained in the transfer instruments referred to in Article 46 of the GDPR. These measures are necessary to guarantee a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EEA, even if access by public authorities is in accordance with the legislation of the country of the importer, when this access goes beyond what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society. These measures are intended to prevent any potentially illicit access, by preventing the authorities from identifying the persons concerned, infer information about them, to distinguish them in another context or associate the transferred data with other data sets that may contain, including online identifiers provided by devices, applications, tools and protocols used by data subjects in other contexts” (paragraph 79). 4.2.3 Additional measures implemented by Google Google LLC, as the recipient of the data, has adopted contractual measures, organizational and technical to complete the standard data protection clauses. \[…\] As prescribed by the CJEU and the EDPS, it is necessary to verify whether the measures supplements adopted by Google LLC are effective, i.e. they meet the particular problem of the possibility of access by the American intelligence services to the data in question. With regard to the ""legal and organizational measures"" adopted, it should be noted that neither the notification of users (if this is possible), nor the publication of a report of transparency or a policy for managing government access requests (“policy on handling government requests”) does not actually prevent or reduce access US intelligence services. Moreover, it is not clear from the elements of the record to what extent the careful examination of the legality of each request to which Google LLC proceeds is an effective additional measure. Indeed, according to the CJEU, even lawful requests by U.S. intelligence services do not comply with requirements of European data protection law. 8. With regard to the “technical measures” adopted, it should be noted that it has not been clarified, neither by Google LLC nor by the company how the described measures – such as the protection of communications between Google services, protection of data in transit between data centers, the protection of communications between users and sites web or on-site security – prevent or reduce the possibilities of access by US intelligence services based on the US legal framework. With respect to encryption techniques, such as those for stored data in data centers, mentioned in particular by Google LLC as a measure technically, it should be noted that Google LLC, as a data importer has in all the cases the obligation to grant access or to provide the data imported which are in its possession, including the encryption keys necessary to make the data intelligible (see recommendations 01/2020, point 81). In other words, as long as Google LLC has the possibility of accessing the data of natural persons in clear text, such measures techniques cannot be considered effective in this case. Regarding Google LLC's argument that Google Analytics data which are transferred by the site managers are pseudonymised, it should be noted that universal unique identifiers (UUIDs) do not correspond to the definition of article 4.5 of the GDPR. Indeed, if pseudonymization can be a technique participating in the protection of privacy, unique identifiers – as noted above – have the purpose of specific purpose to individualize users, not to serve as a guarantee. Furthermore, he has also pointed out above how the combination of unique identifiers with other elements (such as browser or device metadata or IP address) and the possibility of linking such information to a Google account or an account \[…\] allow in any case to be able to identify an individual. Regarding the ""optional technical measure"" put forward by Google LLC, which consists of an IP address anonymization function, it should first be noted that a such measure is optional and is not applicable to all transfers. Furthermore, it does not appear no response from Google if this anonymization takes place before the transfer or if the IP address whole is, in any case, transmitted to the United States and is shortened only in a second time, after the transfer to the United States. Thus, from a technical point of view, there is a access to the entire IP address before it is shortened. Therefore, the additional measures adopted, as presented by Google, are not effective as none of them solve the problems specific to the case. Indeed, none of them prevent the services from US intelligence to access the data in question or render this access ineffective. 4.3. Exceptions provided for in Chapter V of the Regulations Article 49 of the Rules provides “1. In the absence of an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45(3) or appropriate safeguards under Article 46, including binding corporate rules, a transfer or set of transfers of data to personal character to a third country or to an international organization cannot take place only under one of the following conditions: 9.a) the data subject has given explicit consent to the proposed transfer, after having been informed of the risks that this transfer could entail for her due to the absence of decision of adequacy and appropriate safeguards; b) the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the request of the data subject; \[…\]” The company argues that the transfer could be based on Article 49.1.a of the GDPR in indicating that the person concerned can refuse that Google can follow his visit to the site web. However, the consent by a user to the deposit of tracers during his visit to the site web cannot be considered equivalent to ""explicit consent to the transfer envisaged, after having been informed of the risks that this transfer could entail for her in due to the absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards"" within the meaning of Article 49.1.a of the Rules. In this regard, it may be noted that the company, far from establishing that such consent has been obtained, does not put forward any information relating to these elements which would be transmitted to visitors to the website. The company also invokes Article 49.1.b of the Regulation insofar as these functionalities are necessary for the proper functioning of the website and the detection of anomalies. This argument is nevertheless not supported by any precise element and, above all, the company does not establish that there is a contractual relationship between it and all the users of its website. Consequently, the company cannot rely on Article 49 of the Regulations to base the transfers in question. 4.4. Conclusion Therefore, it must be concluded that the company cannot rely on any of the instruments provided for in Chapter V of the Regulation to justify the transfer of personal data personal details of visitors to its website, and in particular unique identifiers, IP addresses, browser data and metadata, to Google LLC in the United States. Thus, due to this transfer of data, the company compromises the level of protection of personal data of data subjects, as guaranteed in Article 44 of the GDPR. Consequently, \[…\] is given formal notice within a period of one (1) month from the notification of this decision and subject to the measures that it could have already adopt, of: • bring the processing relating to the Google Analytics functionality into compliance with articles 44 and following of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the Parliament European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016, if necessary, ceasing to deal with personal data under the current version of Google Analytics; 10, • justify to the CNIL that the aforementioned request has been complied with, and this within the time limit. At the end of this period, if \[...\] has complied with this formal notice, it will be considered that the present procedure is closed and a letter will be sent to him to this effect. Conversely, if \[…\] has not complied with this formal notice, he is reminded that a rapporteur may be appointed to require the Restricted Committee to pronounce one of the sanctions provided for by article 20 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended.

The implementation of radar chips involves the collection and processing of data relating to all vehicles travelling on the section being monitored, and not only those of vehicles in breach of the law. Indeed, the radar-slices are composed of two checkpoints placed several kilometres apart on the roadway, at the entrance and exit of the controlled section. These bollards are equipped with an automatic vehicle licence plate recognition (AVLR) system that reads the licence plates and records the exact time of passage. At the exit point, a software program calculates the average speed of each vehicle on the section based on the distance travelled in relation to the time of passage. If the maximum authorised speed is exceeded, the ETVM automatically sends the data of the vehicles concerned to the National Automated Control Processing Centre in Rennes (hereafter the CNT ), which is responsible for sending the ticket. On the framework for the processing of personal data collected by the radar-switches by the order of 13 October 2004 The processing of personal data carried out by the radar-slices is governed by Article 2-1 of the Order of 13 October 2004 creating an automated control system. The Ministry of the Interior asked the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (hereinafter the CNIL or the Commission) for an opinion on the amendment of the aforementioned order and issued a decision on 11 July 2013. Article 2-1 I of the Order of 13 October 2004 stipulates that the radar-slices collect the following information: photographs of the vehicle and its passengers, the place, date and time of the photographs, the vehicle's lane of travel and the vehicle's registration number. Processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties shall fall within the scope of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (hereinafter referred to as Directive (EU) 2016/680 ). Directive (EU) 2016/680 has been transposed into French law by Act No. 2018-493 of 20 June 2018 within Chapter XIII of the Act of 6 January 1978. By Order No. 2018-1125 of 12 December 2018, the Government proceeded to rewrite the whole of Law No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 relating to information technology, files and freedoms. As a result, since the transposition of the above-mentioned directive and the entry into force of the above-mentioned ordinance on 1 June 2019, the processing of personal data from radar-slices is covered in particular by Articles 87 et seq. of Title III of the Act of 6 January 1978. As provided for by the aforementioned Article 87, such processing also remains subject to the other relevant provisions of the Law of 6 January 1978, subject to the special provisions contained in Title III of the said Law. III- Failures to comply with the provisions of the Act of 6 January 1978 Pursuant to Decision No. 2018-071C of 30 March 2018 of the President of the Commission, a delegation from the CNIL carried out three on-site inspections: on 6 September 2018 at the CNT, on 17 October 2018 at the service provider responsible for operational maintenance of the radar-slices and on 4 December 2018 on the departmental road 213 in Saint-Nazaire equipped with a radar-slice. Failure to comply with the obligation to observe a data retention period proportionate to the purpose of the processing operation. In application of the law of 6 January 1978, personal data may only be kept for a period of time strictly proportionate to the purpose of the processing implemented. In this sense, article 4-5° of the law of 6 January 1978 provides that personal data must be kept in a form that allows the identification of the persons concerned for a period not exceeding that necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. Article 87 of the Law of 6 January 1978 also provides that the processing shall ensure, in particular, the proportionality of the storage period of personal data, taking into account the purpose of the file and the nature or seriousness of the offences recorded. Furthermore, Article 2-1 III of the Order of 13 October 2004 provides that when no offence against the maximum authorised speed is recorded, the data collected and the corresponding calculated average speed shall be deleted as soon as possible, within a maximum period of 24 hours. Furthermore, in the event of an infringement, Article 3 of that Order stipulates that the data may not be kept for more than ten years ... . With regard to retention periods, the Delegation of Supervision was informed that all number plates collected from the LAPI system of radar-slices are kept in the MCTs in their entirety for 24 hours and then truncated by the second and penultimate characters of the registration number. The data are sent back to the CNT twice a day. The delegation was informed that the retention of the truncated licence plate number is carried out for technical maintenance purposes and, more specifically, for the analysis of the matches made between the data collected by the input and output terminals in order to ensure the proper functioning of the system. Firstly, the delegation noted that complete and truncated licence plate numbers which do not concern infringing vehicles have been kept on the ETVM checked since 26 November 2017 for complete numbers (i.e. for more than 13 months) and since 9 July 2014 for truncated numbers (i.e. for more than 4 years). However, the registration plate numbers of vehicles that are not in breach must not be kept for more than 24 hours in accordance with the provisions of the Order of 13 October 2004 as amended. Article 2-1 of the Order provides that Where no infringement of the maximum authorised speed is detected, the data collected and the corresponding calculated average speed shall be deleted as soon as possible, within a maximum period of 24 hours. On this point, in its opinion of 11 July 2013, the CNIL considered that the data must be deleted as soon as possible after the vehicles that have not committed an offence pass in front of the exit terminal and noted that the data relating to vehicles that have not committed an offence are not transmitted to the National Processing Centre (CNT) and are therefore not recorded in the automated control system, as provided for in draft Article 2-1 (III) of the amended Order of 13 October 2004. Article 3 of the said Order is also amended to expressly mention that only data relating to offending vehicles are recorded in the automated control system. It had also noted that data relating to vehicles that are not in breach are stored locally for 24 hours in the speed camera terminals. If the hard disk capacity of the speed camera bollards allows for storage for seven days, an automatic process is used to delete the data after 24 hours by means of a line deletion command. Each time the system is restarted (every 24 hours), it checks that the deleted data has been purged. The CNIL points out that truncated license plate numbers constitute personal data, as long as they are coupled, as in this case, with a timestamp and the location of the truncated radar and are likely to be cross-checked with other data, in particular photos of the vehicle and its passengers. Thus, the 24-hour retention period applies both to full registration plate numbers and to truncated registration plate numbers of the second and penultimate characters, since the amended Order of 13 October 2004 does not make any distinction on this point. Secondly, during the check on 6 September 2018, the delegation noted the presence of messages relating to offences, containing data on vehicles that had exceeded the authorized speed limit, transmitted to CNT to give rise to a ticket, which had been kept at CNT since 1 September 2005 (i.e. for more than 13 years). However, the amended Order of 13 October 2004 provides that the data must not be kept for more than 10 years. Article 3 provides that data may not be kept for more than ten years, without prejudice to the possibility for the driver of a vehicle to request their erasure under the conditions laid down in Article L. 130-9 of the Highway Code . Thirdly, the delegation noted the presence of messages relating to offences that had failed to be sent to the CNT and which had been kept on the ETVM checked since 2 January 2015, i.e. for more than three years. However, the data constituting an offence message not sent to the CNT should not be kept for more than one year after the photograph was taken, after which time tickets are time-barred, pursuant to article 9 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the vehicle data can therefore no longer be used to issue a ticket. All of these facts constitute a breach of the obligations provided for in Articles 4-5° and 87 of the Act of 6 January 1978, which stipulate in particular that the data controller is required to ensure the proportionality of the storage period for personal data, taking into account the purpose of the file and the nature or seriousness of the offences recorded. Failure to comply with the obligation to ensure the security of personal data Pursuant to the law of 6 January 1978, it is the responsibility of the data controller to ensure the security of personal data. Thus, article 4-6° of the law of 6 January 1978 provides that personal data must be processed in such a way as to ensure appropriate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, or access by unauthorised persons, using appropriate technical or organisational measures . In addition, Article 99 of the Act of 6 January 1978 provides that I. - In order to demonstrate that the processing is carried out in accordance with this title, the data controller and its processor shall implement the measures provided for in Articles 24 and 25 (1 and 2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 and those appropriate to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, in particular with regard to the processing of special categories of personal data mentioned in I of Article 6 of this Act. II. - With regard to automated processing, the data controller or its processor shall implement, following a risk assessment, measures designed to : 1° Prevent any unauthorized person from accessing the installations used for processing ; 2° Prevent data carriers from being read, copied, modified or deleted in an unauthorised manner; 3° Prevent the unauthorised input of personal data into the file, as well as the unauthorised inspection, modification or deletion of recorded personal data; 4° Prevent the use of automated processing systems by unauthorized persons using data transmission equipment; 5° To ensure that persons authorized to use an automated processing system can only access the personal data to which they are authorized to have access; 6° Guarantee that it is possible to verify and establish to which bodies personal data have been or may be transmitted or made available by data transmission equipment; 7° Guarantee that it is possible to verify and establish a posteriori which personal data have been entered into automated processing systems and when and by whom they were entered; 8° Prevent the unauthorised reading, copying, modification or deletion of personal data during the transmission of personal data and during the transport of data carriers; 9° Ensure that the systems installed can be restored in the event of an interruption; 10° To guarantee that the system functions work, that operating errors are reported and that the personal data stored cannot be corrupted by a system malfunction. Finally, Article 101 of the Act of 6 January 1978 provides that the data controller shall establish for each automated processing operation a log of the collection, modification, consultation and communication operations, including transfers, interconnection and deletion, relating to such data. The logs of consultation and communication operations make it possible to establish the reason, date and time. They shall also make it possible, as far as possible, to identify the persons consulting or communicating the data and the recipients of the data. The logbook shall be used only for the purposes of verification of the lawfulness of the processing, self-monitoring, ensuring data integrity and security and for the purposes of criminal proceedings . In the light of these provisions, the Delegation noted three series of shortcomings, which could affect the security of the personal data processing operations implemented in the context of the radar-switches: a lack of robustness of the passwords for connection to the ETVM, unsatisfactory traceability of the accesses, as well as insufficient management of the access rights to the application by the provider of the Ministry of Interior. A detailed description of these shortcomings is provided in the Annex. Consequently, the Ministry of the Interior, located at Place Beauvau - 75008 Paris, shall be given formal notice, within three (3) months of notification of this Decision and subject to any measures it may have already adopted, to : delete data kept beyond the period necessary for the purposes for which they are processed, in particular as defined in Article 2-1 of the Order of 13 October 2004; in the future, ensure compliance with the retention periods provided for in the Order of 13 October 2004 and put in place a purging mechanism (e.g. by using an automated purging system) making it possible to guarantee compliance with the retention periods provided for in the aforementioned Order, in particular by deleting the following data ; data relating to vehicles which have not committed an offence within a maximum period of 24 hours ; data relating to vehicles that have committed an offence within a maximum period of one year when they have not been the subject of a fine; data on vehicles that have committed an offence within a maximum of ten years where they have been ticketed; take all necessary measures to guarantee the security of the personal data processed and in particular those referred to in the annex to this formal notice ; justify to the CNIL that all of the aforementioned requests have been complied with within the time limit set. At the end of this period, if the Ministry of the Interior has complied with the present formal notice, it will be considered that the present procedure is closed and a letter will be sent to it to this effect. Conversely, if the Ministry of the Interior has not complied with this formal notice, a rapporteur will be appointed who may ask the restricted formation to take one of the corrective measures provided for in Article 20 of the Law of 6 January 1978.

The processing of personal data known as StopCovid, for which the Minister of Health (Directorate General of Health) is responsible for processing, was created by Decree No. 2020-650 of 29 May 2020 on the processing of data known as StopCovid, supplemented by the Order of the Minister of Solidarity and Health of 30 May 2020, defining the criteria of distance and duration of contact with regard to the risk of contamination by the covid-19 virus for the operation of the data processing known as StopCovid. Prior to the launch of the application, two requests for opinions on the terms and conditions of implementation of the application were submitted to the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (hereinafter the CNIL or the Commission). In a first opinion dated 24 April 2020, the Commission ruled on the general compliance with personal data protection rules of the mobile contact tracking application project called StopCovid as envisaged by the government at the time. In a second opinion of 25 May 2020, the Commission gave its opinion on the draft decree on the same mobile application. The StopCovid France application is a contact tracing application which allows each user to record a history of contacts with other users, i.e. information relating to the proximity between two mobile terminals. It allows the user to declare himself diagnosed or screened for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It also allows users to be informed that they have been in the vicinity of at least one other user diagnosed or screened positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and, if necessary, to be invited to contact a health professional for treatment as quickly as possible and thus be integrated into the more general SARS-CoV-2 virus management system (SI-DEP and Contact Covid information systems). The application, whose downloading and use is based on a voluntary approach by the user, works by preserving the proximity history, consisting of the pseudonyms emitted by the computers via Bluetooth technology with low power consumption. In practice, once installed and features activated, the application sends and receives specific Bluetooth messages from other computers on which the StopCovid France application has been installed and activated. If a user of the application is diagnosed or tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, they can declare it in the application using a code provided by the healthcare professional (via a 6-character code or QR Code). The use of this code by the user allows him/her to send his/her contact history to the central server, which then processes each of the contacts in the history, in order to estimate the risk of contamination with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The server maintains a database where each record corresponds to a user and contains the risk score associated with that user. The application contacts the server once a day to check the user's exposure status. Users who have been in contact (within 1 meter for at least 15 minutes) with the person diagnosed or tested positive are notified that they have been exposed to a risk of contamination with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. They are then invited to follow specific instructions related to the protection of their health and the fight against the spread of the virus (monitoring of symptoms, containment, contact with a health professional). A new version of the StopCovid France application (version v1.1.\*) was deployed at the end of June 2020, and constitutes an updated version of the StopCovid France version at its launch date (version v1.0.\*). This new version of the application brings two major changes. Firstly, the captcha authentication method - which makes it possible to check during the initial activation of the application that it is used by a human being - which was based on the reCaptcha technology from the company GOOGLE, is now replaced by the captcha technology developed by the company ORANGE. In addition, a pre-filter function of the contact history of the user who tests positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, based on criteria of contact duration and distance from the contact, is activated to act on the user's phone. To date, both versions of the application co-exist. Users who downloaded the application on or after June 25, 2020, or who have updated the application since that date have version v1.1.\* on their computers. Users who downloaded the application before 25 June 2020 and have not updated it, still have the previous version v1.0.\* on their computers. On the day of the CNIL checks on 25 and 26 June 2020, the StopCovid France application in version v1.0.\* had been downloaded approximately 1.9 million times and had been activated approximately 1.5 million times. As version v1.1.\* of the application had been deployed at the time of the checks carried out by the CNIL, the delegation was unable to ascertain during these missions the number of installations and activations of the latest version of the application. A request for information in this regard was therefore subsequently sent to the Ministry of Solidarity and Health. The Ministry replied on 10 July 2020 that the number of StopCovid France applications installed and activated after the release of v1.1.\* was approximately 147,000. II. The procedure Pursuant to Decision No 2020-097C of 28 May 2020 of the President of the Commission, a CNIL delegation carried out an online inspection mission on 9 June 2020 and carried out two on-the-spot inspections on 25 and 26 June 2020, for the purpose of verifying the compliance of any processing of personal data carried out from the StopCovid France application or relating to personal data collected from this application, with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (hereinafter the Regulation or the RGPD) and Law No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 as amended (hereinafter the Data Protection Act). Subsequently, the Ministry of Solidarity and Health provided the delegation, by emails dated 19 June, 4, 7, 8 and 10 July 2020, with the additional documents requested during the inspections concerning, in particular, the impact analysis relating to the processing of personal data from the application, the contracts concluded between the Ministry of Solidarity and Health and INRIA for the development and operation of the application, the personal data processing register and the technical documentation relating to the operation of the application. III-Examination of the conformity of the processing In the context of these checks, the delegation noted that the operation of the StopCovid France application, in particular version v1.1.\*, essentially complies with the applicable provisions on the protection of personal data. Most of the recommendations made by the Commission in its opinions of 24 April and 25 May 2020 have been taken into account by the Ministry of Solidarity and Health. However, the delegation noted certain breaches of the provisions of the RGPD and the Data Protection Act, which are the subject of this formal notice. 1. 1. Failures to comply with the provisions of the RGPD Failure to comply with the obligation to process personal data in accordance with the terms of the decree of 29 May 2020, pursuant to Article 5-1-a) of the RGPD. Article 5(1)(a) of the Regulation stipulates that: personal data must be processed in a lawful, fair and transparent manner with regard to the data subject (lawfulness, fairness, transparency). The delegation was informed that, in the version of the StopCovid France application available on the day of the check (version v1.0.\* of the application), when a user declares that he has been diagnosed or tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, his entire contact history is traced back to the central server managed on behalf of the Ministry of Solidarity and Health, without any prior data pre-filtering process based on criteria of distance and duration of contact with another user. However, 5° of I of Article 2 of Decree No. 2020-650 of 29 May 2020 relating to data processing known as StopCovid provides that the proximity history of a user is limited to the user's contact data with other users who are, for a given period of time, at such a distance from his mobile phone that there is a sufficiently significant risk that a user who is positive for the covid-19 virus will contaminate the other user. Moreover, the 6° of I of article 2 of the aforementioned decree specifies that the data of the proximity history of contacts at risk of contamination by the covid-19 virus (...) are transmitted by users diagnosed or tested positive for the covid-19 virus who wish to do so to the central server. While the terms of the decree and the elements that had been transmitted to the Commission do not rule out the possibility of additional filtering at the central server level, it nevertheless follows from these provisions that the processing authorised by the decree of 29 May 2020, in accordance with what had been presented to the Commission, must carry out an initial filtering at the telephone level. Consequently, the version of the StopCovid France application available on the day of the inspection (version v1.0.\* of the application) is contrary to the provisions of the Decree of 29 May 2020. The aforementioned facts constitute a breach of the obligations set out in Article 5-1-a) of the RGPD. Moreover, it is noted that the design of the application described in the decree, which makes it possible to avoid having all the user's contact history sent back to the central server by pre-filtering the proximity history data directly from the computer, was a particularly relevant choice with regard to the objective of protecting personal data. It is also observed that the latest available version of the application (version v1.1.\*) - in which the pre-filtering of contact history data is active at the user's phone - is compliant with the decree in this respect and more protective of personal data. The President of the CNIL therefore considers it necessary, in order to ensure that the processing fully complies with the provisions of the decree of 29 May 2020, that the data controller ceases to send all of the data from the user's contact history to the central server, for example by taking all appropriate measures to allow widespread use of the new version of the application. Failure to inform the data subjects Article 13 of the Regulation requires the controller to provide, at the time the data are collected, information relating to his or her identity and contact details, those of the Data Protection Officer, the purposes of the processing operation and its legal basis, the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, where applicable transfers of personal data outside the European Union, the period for which the personal data will be kept, the rights of individuals with regard to the processing of their data and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. The delegation noted that the personal data processing policy is provided to users of the StopCovid France application from a privacy section - accessible during the application's activation process - and from the web page https://bonjour.stopcovid.gouv.fr/privacy.html entitled Personal data - also accessible from several links in the application's activation process. The confidentiality section and the Personal Data page inform users of the application of the identity and contact details of the data controller and the data protection officer, the purposes of the processing and its legal basis, the duration of data retention, the rights of the persons concerned, in particular their right to lodge a complaint with the CNIL. The Chair considers that the information provided is essentially in line with the DPMR. However, she considers that, on one point, the information provided on the categories of recipients of the data is incomplete. Indeed, the confidentiality section only informs the user that the data are shared by \[the\] application with the server managed by the Ministry of Solidarity and Health, only if you are tested positive and with your agreement. Furthermore, the data recipient section of the Personal Data page contains only one paragraph regarding recipients, which reads as follows: Users identified by the application as contacts at risk of having contracted the COVID-19 virus are recipients of the information that they have been close to at least one other user diagnosed or tested positive for the COVID-19 virus . The delegation was informed that INRIA, acting as assistant to the project manager of the Ministry of Solidarity and Health, processes personal data from the StopCovid France application on behalf of the Ministry of Solidarity and Health. Therefore, the information provided to users of the StopCovid France application regarding the recipients or categories of recipients of personal data should mention the existence of a processor and is incomplete on this point. These facts constitute a breach of Article 13 of the DPMR. A failure to comply with the obligation to frame by a formalised legal act the processing operations carried out by processors on behalf of the controller. Article 28 of the Regulation provides that where a processing operation is carried out by a processor, it shall be governed by a contract or other legal instrument which stipulates the purpose and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data, the categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. The contract shall also lay down the conditions under which the processor undertakes to carry out the processing operations on behalf of the controller. The delegation noted that INRIA holds a contract for project management assistance on behalf of the Ministry of Solidarity and Health, in particular for the deployment, facilities management, operation, hosting and scalable maintenance of the StopCovid application. In this context, INRIA acts as a subcontractor for the processing of personal data on behalf of the Ministry of Solidarity and Health. The delegation noted that the contract between INRIA and the Ministry of Solidarity and Health contains most of the information required by Article 28 of the RGPD. In particular, it specifies the purpose and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data processed and the categories of persons concerned. However, the Delegation has noted that the clauses of the contractual documents of the contract for assistance to the project manager which were sent to it at the end of its monitoring missions, and in response to the request made in this context, are incomplete as regards the obligations and rights of the controller and the conditions under which the processor undertakes to carry out the processing operations on behalf of the controller, in particular, do not specify that the processor shall assist the controller in fulfilling his obligation to comply with requests made by data subjects to exercise their rights, that the processor shall assist the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations provided for in Articles 32 to 36 of the DPMR and that the processor shall make available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations provided for in Article 28 and to allow audits to be carried out. These facts constitute a breach of section 28 of the GDR. A failure to carry out a full impact assessment Article 35(7)(a) of the Regulation requires the data protection impact assessment to contain at least a systematic description of the proposed processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where appropriate, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller. The delegation noted that since the launch of the StopCovid France application, the Ministry of Solidarity and Health has updated its impact assessment on the protection of personal data resulting from the application. The Ministry of Solidarity and Health has thus provided the delegation with an updated version of the impact assessment as of 3 July 2020. The impact studies carried out are generally in line with the provisions of Article 35-7-a) and essentially follow the Commission's recommendations. However, the delegation noted that the latest version of the AIPD does not specify that the anti DDOS solution (solution to prevent denial of service attacks) proposed by the ORANGE company and implemented in the application for the purpose of securing the system involves the collection of the IP (internet protocol) addresses of the application's users. However, the delegation noted that when a user connects to the StopCovid France application, the IP address of the computer is collected as part of the anti DDOS solution of the company ORANGE. It was also found that the collection of this personal data has no other purpose, in this case, than to ensure the security of the device. The Chairperson stated that, since the anti-DDOS solution was a security solution, it did not need to be included in the decree of 29 May 2020. Consequently, the data processed by this solution did not have to be included in the decree either. The collection of IP addresses in this context is therefore not irregular. On the other hand, since this security solution involves the collection of personal data, the description of this processing operation must appear in the impact assessment carried out by the data controller. Similarly, the delegation noted that the collection of data present on the user's connected equipment in the context of the reCaptcha technology of the company GOOGLE deployed in the initial version of the application (v1.0.\* of the application), is not specified in the impact assessment. By not describing all the personal data processing operations in connection with the StopCovid France application and the measures to limit the risks, the impact assessment prepared by the Ministry of Solidarity and Health does not fully meet the requirements of Article 35 of the RGPD. These facts constitute a failure to comply with Article 35 of the RGPD. 2. Failure to comply with the provisions of the French Data Protection Act (Loi Informatique et Libertés). Failure to inform the user and obtain the user's consent before entering and reading information on his or her electronic communication terminal equipment Article 82 of the law of 6 January 1978 as amended provides that : Any subscriber or user of an electronic communications service must be informed in a clear and complete manner, unless he has been previously informed by the data controller or his representative : 1° Of the purpose of any action tending to access, by electronic transmission, information already stored in its electronic communications terminal equipment, or to enter information in this equipment ; 2° The means at his disposal to oppose it. Such registered accesses may only take place on condition that the subscriber or user has expressed, after receiving this information, his consent, which may result from the appropriate parameters of his connection device or any other device under his control. (…) The delegation was informed that both versions of the StopCovid France application contain a captcha solution designed to assess whether or not the behaviour of a user of the application corresponds to that of a human. The delegation was informed that the latest version of the StopCovid France application (version v.1.1.\*) is based on captcha technology developed by the company ORANGE, which does not require any reading or writing operation on the user's computer. On the other hand, the initial version of the StopCovid France application (version v1.0.\*) contains the reCaptcha technology, in its invisible version, developed by the company GOOGLE. The delegation noted that GOOGLE informs the developers of the reCaptcha technology that the reCAPTCHA API works by collecting hardware and software information (such as device and application data) and that this data is sent to Google for analysis.... It is your responsibility to inform users and to seek their permission to collect and share this data with Google. For users in the European Union, you and the API customer(s) must comply with the EU User Consent Rules ( ). As a result of the information GOOGLE provides to the developers, the collection of information about the user's computer is not only for the purpose of securing the application, but also for analysis by GOOGLE. The company itself informs the developers that the use of this solution is subject to the requirements set by Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, namely the information and consent of the persons concerned for these operations. However, the delegation noted that users of the StopCovid France application in its version v1.0.\* are at no time informed, in particular through a consent window at the time of activation of the application, of the collection of information stored on their mobile equipment nor of the means to refuse this collection. The user's consent to access information stored on their mobile equipment or to register information on their mobile equipment is not collected at any time during the activation of the StopCovid France application. These facts constitute a breach of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act. In addition, given the state of the information available to her, the President of the CNIL cannot rule out the possibility that the Google reCaptcha may still be used by people who have downloaded version 1.0.\* of the application but have not yet activated it. IV. Additional comment The fight against the covid-19 epidemic, which comes under the constitutionally valid objective of health protection, is a major imperative which may justify, under certain conditions, infringements of the right to protection of privacy and personal data. It is nevertheless recalled that the infringement of privacy is admissible in the present case only if the government can rely on sufficient evidence to have reasonable assurance that the StopCovid France application is useful in managing the crisis. The Commission had therefore requested, in its opinion of 25 May 2020, that the actual impact of the device on the overall health strategy be studied and documented by the government on a regular basis throughout its period of use. It was noted on the day of the inspections that the formal assessment of the effectiveness of the application had not yet started and that the timetable for the assessment work had not yet been established by the Ministry. The President of the CNIL therefore invites the Ministry of Solidarity and Health to begin this evaluation process as soon as possible and to report to her on the results. In view of the aforementioned shortcomings, and in view of the information she received from the Ministry of Solidarity and Health concerning the number of applications still installed in version v.1, the CNIL President invites the Ministry of Solidarity and Health to undertake this evaluation process as soon as possible and to report back to her on the results. .0.\* after the release of version v1.1.\* of the application, the President of the CNIL gives formal notice to the Ministry of Solidarity and Health, located at 14 avenue Duquesne 75007, within one (1) month of notification of this decision and subject to any measures it may have already adopted, to : - cease to upload all data from the user's contact history to the central server in breach of the legal framework defined by the provisions of Decree No. 2020-650 of 29 May 2020, for example by forcing the update of the StopCovid France application to the new version v1.1.\* by blocking the application in its version v1.0.\* ; - supplement the information provided to users of the StopCovid France application under the conditions set out in Article 13 of the Regulation, by providing users with full information on the recipients or categories of recipients of personal data from the application ; - ensure that subcontracting contracts concluded in connection with the operation of the StopCovid France application contain the information provided for in Article 28 of the Regulation; - complete the impact assessment relating to the protection of personal data from the StopCovid France application in accordance with Article 35 of the Regulation, o by mentioning the collection of the IP address of the application user's mobile equipment as part of the security measures of the system based on the anti DDOS solution from the ORANGE company, o by mentioning the collection of information present on the user's mobile equipment as part of the reCaptcha technology of the company GOOGLE deployed as part of version v1.0.\* of the application, in the event that this data is still collected; - to ensure, if necessary, to inform and collect the consent of the persons concerned to the actions of reading and writing information present on the electronic communication terminals by the GOOGLE company within the framework of the reCaptcha technology (version v1.0.\* of the application), in accordance with the provisions of article 82 of the Data-processing law and Freedoms. This injunction applies to users who have downloaded the version v1.0.\* of the application and have not yet activated it for the first time. - justify to the CNIL that all the above-mentioned requests have been respected, within the time limit. At the end of this deadline, if the Ministry of Solidarity and Health has complied with this formal notice, it will be considered that this procedure is closed and a letter will be sent to it to this effect. Conversely, if the Ministry of Solidarity and Health has not complied with this formal notice, a rapporteur will be appointed who may ask the restricted formation to take one of the measures provided for in Article 20 of the Act of 6 January 1978 as amended.

The procedure The company CLEARVIEW AI (hereinafter ""the company"" or ""Clearview""), established in the United States, was created in 2017. It has developed facial recognition software, the database of which is based on the aspiration of photographs publicly available on the Internet, which identify a person from a photograph representing him. The National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms (hereinafter ""CNIL"") received several complaints between May and December 2020 relating to the difficulties encountered by complainants in exercising their rights of access and erasure with the company. In application of the decision n ° 2020-116C of August 26, 2020 of the President of the CNIL, a delegation of the CNIL carried out a documentary control mission by sending a questionnaire on October 27, 2020, to which the CNIL company responded by letter of the following November 27. This questionnaire focused on the various processing operations implemented by the company, the user organizations of the company's services (current or former) having their main establishment in France or within the European Union as well as complaints n ° 20008376 and nr. ° 20012263. On May 27, 2021, the CNIL received a complaint from the Privacy International organization (referral n ° 21010202) relating to the company's facial recognition software and its use by law enforcement agencies. As part of the mutual assistance provided for in article 61 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter the ""GDPR"" or the ""Regulation), the CNIL is is seen imparting useful information by several of its European counterparts. II.The context From useful information, transmitted in the framework of cooperation between supervisory authorities, publicly accessible information as well as complaints received by the Commission, it appears that the company uses clean technology to index freely accessible web pages. It collects all images that have faces on millions of websites. Photographs are thus extracted in particular from social networks (for example, Twitter or Facebook), professional sites containing photographs of their employees, blogs and all sites on which photographs of people are publicly accessible. Images are also taken from videos available online, for example at www.youtube.com. This collection concerns images of both adults and minors, no filter being applied in this regard. Only hundreds of URLs, associated with ""adult"" sites with the largest audiences, are blocked and excluded from collection. The collection of these images on social networks covers all of the images accessible at the time of collection to a person not connected to the network in question. Outside of social networks, the collection concerns all the images accessible at the time of collection by a search engine. The company has thus collected more than ten billion images. From each photograph collected, the company calculates a biometric template. A unique digital imprint, specific to the face as it appears in the photograph (based on the points of the face) is thus generated. The billions of images are then saved to a database in a searchable form (using the digital fingerprint). The company markets access to an online platform with a search engine. This tool works by uploading a photograph of a face to it. From this photograph, the tool calculates the digital fingerprint corresponding to it and searches the database for photographs to which similar fingerprints are linked. The software produces a search result, composed of photographs, to which is associated the URL of the web page from which they were extracted (social network, press article, blog ...). This search result thus compiles all the images society collects about a person as well as the context in which these images are online, such as, for example, the social media account or a newspaper article. The company describes the service it offers as ""a search tool used by law enforcement agencies to identify perpetrators and victims of crimes"" from a photograph. It says on its website that the tool allows, for example, ""analysts"" to conduct research by uploading crime scene footage to compare with those that are publicly available. Law enforcement can thus use this tool to identify a person of whom they have an image (for example, from a CCTV recording) but do not know the identity. III.On the applicability of the GDPR Pursuant to Article 3, paragraph 2 of the GDPR: ""This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data relating to data subjects who are in the territory of the Union by a controller or a sub -contractor who is not established in the Union, when the processing activities are linked to: \[…\] b) monitoring the behavior of such persons, insofar as this is behavior that takes place in the within the Union. ""(emphasis added). Recital 24 of the GDPR specifies in this regard that ""The processing of personal data of data subjects who are located in the Union by a controller or a processor who is not established in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when such processing is linked to the monitoring of the behavior of such persons in so far as it concerns their behavior within the Union. behavior of data subjects, it should be established whether natural persons are followed on the internet, which includes the possible subsequent use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling of a natural person, in order to including making decisions about her or analyzing or predicting her preferences, behaviors and moods ""(emphasis added). By way of clarification, in its guidelines 3/2018 relating to the territorial scope of the GDPR in their version of 12 November 2019, the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter ""the EDPS"") notes that, "" Contrary to the provision of Article 3 (2) (a), neither Article 3 (2) (b) nor Recital 24 expressly introduces a necessary degree of ""intention to target"" of the part of the controller or processor to determine whether the monitoring activity would trigger the application of the GDPR to processing activities. However, the use of the word ""monitoring"" implies that the controller is pursuing a specific objective by view of the collection and subsequent reuse of relevant data relating to a person's behavior within the Union. The Committee does not consider that the online collection or analysis of personal data relating to persons in the Union would automatically be considered a ""follow-up"". It will be necessary to take into account the purpose of the data processing by the controller and, in particular, any subsequent behavioral analysis or profiling technique involving such data. The Committee takes into account the wording of recital 24, which indicates that in order to determine whether the processing involves the monitoring of the behavior of a data subject, the monitoring of natural persons on the internet, including the potential subsequent use of profiling techniques , is an important factor "". Insofar as the company is not established in the European Union, it is therefore necessary, for the GDPR to be applicable to the processing in question, to determine whether the processing concerns personal data relating to data subjects on the territory of the European Union and whether the processing is linked to monitoring the behavior of these persons. First of all, it emerges from the company's confidentiality policy appended hereto that the company collects in particular: photographs publicly available on the Internet; information that can be extracted from these photographs, such as geolocation metadata that the photograph may contain; information derived from the facial appearances of the people in those photographs. These three categories of data constitute personal data of the person whose face appears in the photograph in question. Indeed, the notion of personal data is defined in the GDPR as ""any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person \[...\]"", this identification being able to relate in particular ""to one or more specific elements specific to his identity. physical "". The image of the person photographed or filmed constitutes personal data as soon as the person is identifiable, that is to say, it can be recognized. In addition, this image can be compared (by an automated process or not) with an image held elsewhere and attached to an identified person and the identity of that person can be inferred. The company also processes biometric data associated with these images. In addition, the images collected concern people located in the European Union. Indeed, this collection is not geographically limited to the American territory on which the company is established, since this data is collected on the Internet, in particular from global social networks. The CNIL notes that, in the context of its responses to the questionnaire sent by the control delegation, the company acknowledges processing personal data of European residents, in particular by affirming that it accepts all access and opposition requests. made by residents of the European Union. In particular, people located in France were affected by the processing in question since the CNIL received three complaints from people residing in France relating to the difficulties encountered in the exercise of their right of access and opposition. from the company. Therefore, the company processes personal data of natural persons located in the European Union and, in particular, in France. Second, in order to establish whether the processing activity in question can be considered to be linked to the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects within the meaning of Article 3 of the GDPR, it is necessary to determine whether the natural persons are doing the same. subject to Internet tracking. In accordance with recital 24 of the GDPR, the notion of Internet tracking includes the possible subsequent use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling of a natural person. Profiling is defined in Article 4 of the GDPR as ""any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of using this personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person"". It should also be noted that Article 3 of the GDPR does not require that the processing has as its purpose the monitoring of the behavior of individuals but is simply ""linked"" to it. It should be noted as a preliminary point that the processing operations implemented by the company in order to collect data and constitute a database, which a search engine accesses to provide a result are analyzed here globally, in with regard to their common purpose, which is to market a search engine based on facial recognition (hereinafter ""the processing""). First, the processing in question leads to the creation of a behavioral profile of all the people whose data is collected. It emerges from the useful information, transmitted within the framework of cooperation between supervisory authorities, that the tool in question makes it possible to generate, from a photograph, a search result containing all the photographs having a sufficiently biometric template. close to it. This search result includes all photographs in which a person's face appears that have been collected by the company, subject to technical error. The profile thus created, relating to a person, is composed of photographs but also of the URL address of all the web pages on which these photographs are located. However, the relation between photographs and the context in which they are presented on a website allows us to collect a great deal of information about a person, his habits or his preferences. With regard to social networks in particular, a photograph as well as the original URL of this photograph are highly likely to identify the account of the person concerned. The photographs may also have been posted online to illustrate a press or blog article, which is therefore likely to contain precise information relating to the person concerned and thus elements relating to his behavior. In addition, images may contain metadata, such as geolocation metadata, which is also included in a search result and helps complete a person's profile. Such a search result can also identify a person's behavior on the Internet, by analyzing the information that person has chosen to put online and its context. Indeed, posting photographs online constitutes in itself a behavior of the data subject, reflecting choices on the level of exposure that he wishes to give to elements of his private or professional life. Therefore, it should be considered that the search result which is associated with a photograph must be qualified, at least in part, as a behavioral profile of the data subject since it contains a great deal of information relating to that person and in particular to his behavior. Even assuming that the purpose of the processing itself is not behavioral monitoring, the means implemented to enable the biometric identification system of the company Clearview involve the constitution of such a profile, and the processing can be viewed. as ""linked to the monitoring of the behavior"" of the persons concerned. Second, the automated processing of data enabling this behavioral profile to be created and made available to those making the queries in the company's search engine should qualify as Internet tracking. Indeed, the very purpose of the tool marketed by Clearview is to be able to identify and collect certain information relating to a person. The implementation of the various stages of the treatments described above, and in particular of biometric techniques allowing to single out an individual, lead to the creation of a behavioral profile. However, this profile is created in response to a search carried out by a person and relating to an individual appearing in a photograph. In addition, the search can be repeated over time, which makes it possible to observe a change in the information relating to a person, in particular if the results of successive searches are compared. Indeed, the database being updated regularly, successive searches make it possible to follow the evolution of a profile over time. Therefore, the fact that a one-off search allows, at any time, access to a person's profile as described above should be considered as tracking the behavior of people. The processing implemented in this way is therefore linked to monitoring the behavior of data subjects within the meaning of the provisions of Article 3.2.b) of the GDPR and falls within the territorial scope of the GDPR. IV. On the competence of the CNIL and the lack of applicability of the one-stop-shop mechanism Article 55.1 of the GDPR provides that ""each supervisory authority is competent to exercise the missions and powers vested in it in accordance with this Regulation on the territory of the Member State to which it belongs"". Article 56.1 provides: ""Without prejudice to Article 55, the supervisory authority of the main establishment or of the single establishment of the controller or of the processor is competent to act as the supervisory authority. lead control concerning cross-border processing carried out by that controller or processor, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 60. "" Recital 122 of the GDPR states: ""Each supervisory authority should be competent in the territory of the Member State to which it belongs to exercise the missions and powers vested in it in accordance with this Regulation. This should cover, in particular, \[... \] the processing carried out by a controller or a processor who is not established in the Union when this processing targets data subjects residing in the territory of the Member State to which it belongs. \[…\] "" It emerges from a combined reading of Articles 55 and 56 of the GDPR that, in the event that a data controller located outside the European Union implements cross-border processing subject to the GDPR but does not have neither a central administration, nor an establishment with decision-making power as to its purposes and means, the one-stop-shop mechanism provided for in article 56 of the GDPR is not intended to apply. Each national supervisory authority is therefore competent to monitor compliance with the GDPR on the territory of the Member State to which it belongs. In this case, the company is established in the United States of America and has no establishment in the territory of any member state of the European Union. Consequently, the one-stop-shop mechanism is not applicable and the CNIL is competent to ensure, on French territory, that the processing operations are implemented in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR. V. On breaches of the GDPR 1.A breach of the obligation to have a legal basis for the processing operations carried out Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation provides that: ""Processing is only lawful if and to the extent that at least one of the following conditions is met: a) the data subject has consented to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes; b) the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the performance of pre-contractual measures taken at the latter's request; c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; e) the processing is necessary for the performance of a task of public interest or falling within the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject prevail which require protection of personal data, in particular when the person concerned is a child. "" To be lawful, the processing of personal data must therefore be based on one of the legal bases referred to above. From the useful information transmitted within the framework of the cooperation between supervisory authorities, it appears that the facial recognition software implemented by the company is based on the systematic and generalized collection, from millions of websites around the world, of images containing faces, using proprietary technology to index freely accessible web pages. The company then processes the data collected in order to constitute a database and allow the photographs to be searched in this database from another image. This processing is carried out by the company for exclusively commercial purposes. As part of the investigations carried out by the CNIL, the company was questioned on the legal basis of this processing, within the meaning of Article 6 of the GDPR. The company has not provided any response on this point. The company's privacy policy, previously mentioned, does not further discuss the legal basis for such processing. It can be noted from the outset that the company has not obtained the consent of the data subjects to the processing of their personal data. In addition, given the nature of the processing in question, the legal bases provided for by the provisions of Article 6.1 under b), c), d) and e) of the GDPR and related to the performance of a contract , compliance with a legal obligation, the protection of the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person and the performance of a task of public interest do not apply in the present case. . With regard to the legal basis linked to the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller, provided for in Article 6 1. f) of the Regulation, it should be recalled as a preliminary point that the ""publicly accessible"" nature of data does not affect the qualification of personal data and that there is no general authorization to reuse and re-process publicly available personal data, in particular without the knowledge of the data subjects. By way of illustration, the article 29 working group (known as ""G29"" now the European Data Protection Board (EDPS)), in its Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interest pursued by the data controller data processing within the meaning of Article 7 of Directive 95/46 / EC, noted in this regard that ""personal data, even if they have been made public, remain considered as personal data"" and that ""their treatment therefore continues to require appropriate guarantees"". While acknowledging that the fact that personal data are accessible to the public may be a relevant factor in concluding the existence of legitimate interests, the EDPS then warned that this would only be the case ""if their publication was accompanied by a reasonable expectation of subsequent use of the data for certain purposes, for example, for research or for the sake of transparency and accountability. "" In addition, for the controller to be able to avail himself of this legal basis, the processing must be necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests he pursues, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects prevail. In the present case, even if the interest of the company were based on the economic interest which it derives from the use of the database in question, that interest should nevertheless be weighed against the interests or freedoms and fundamental rights of data subjects, taking into account the reasonable expectations of individuals based on their relationship with the controller, in accordance with Article 6.1.f) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital 47 and the opinion of the EDPS on the concept of legitimate interest mentioned above. In this case, the processing is particularly intrusive: it collects a large amount of photographic data from a given person, to which are associated other personal data that may reveal various aspects of private life. From these data, a biometric template is formed, i.e. biometric data allowing, if it is reliable, to uniquely identify the person from a photograph of the person: the detention of 'such data by a third party constitutes a serious invasion of privacy. Finally, it should be noted that this processing concerns an extremely high number of people. Furthermore, it should in particular be determined whether the data subjects could reasonably expect, at the time and in the context of the collection of personal data, that they would be the subject of such processing by the Clearview company. In this regard, there is no relationship between the company and the persons concerned. While they can reasonably expect third parties to access the photographs in question from time to time, their publicly accessible nature is not sufficient to consider that the persons concerned can reasonably expect their images to feed into software for facial recognition. Finally, the software used by the company is not public and the vast majority of those affected are unaware of its existence. It must therefore be considered that people who have published photographs representing them on websites, or have consented to this publication to another data controller, do not expect them to be reused for the purposes. pursued by the company, that is to say the creation of facial recognition software (which associates the image of a person with a profile containing all the photographs in which it appears, the information that these photographs contain as well as the websites on which they are located) and the marketing of this software to law enforcement agencies. Therefore, in view of all of these elements, the invasion of the privacy of individuals appears disproportionate with regard to the interests of the data controller, in particular his commercial and pecuniary interests, and the legal basis of the legitimate interest. of the company cannot therefore be retained. Consequently, the company has no legal basis for the processing in question, in breach of Article 6 of the Rules. 2.A breach of the obligation to respect the right of access Article 15 of the GDPR provides that ""the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller confirmation that personal data concerning him or her are or are not being processed and, when they are, access to said data. personal data "". This article also provides for the different categories of information that the data controller must provide to the data subject in the event of an access request. Article 12 specifies that: ""the controller facilitates the exercise of the rights conferred on the data subject under Articles 15 to 22"" In the present case, it appears from referral no.20012263 that the complainant requested the company to access the data concerning her and all the information relating to this data within the meaning of article 15.1, by electronic means. . In fact, the complainant mandated a third party to make her access request to the company. Clearview acknowledged receipt while inviting the complainant to use an online platform to exercise her request. More than two months after the initial request and after three more e-mails sent by the authorized third party, the company demanded the transmission of a photograph and an identity document of the complainant and again invited the complainant to use an online platform to make her request. Four months after the initial request, after further exchanges relating to the transmission of an identity document and in the absence of a satisfactory response, the authorized third party sent a letter of formal notice to the company. The company has communicated a response to the request for access which, first of all, is partial. Indeed, it contains only the result of the search in the tool marketed by the company, that is to say the images and the information associated with them. All of the information provided for in Article 15.1 of the GDPR is therefore lacking, the company having contented itself with providing a link to its privacy policy. Then, by agreeing to respond to the complainant's request for access only after seven letters and more than four months after her initial request and by requiring a copy of her identity document while the complainant had already provided information enabling her to be identified as well as a photograph representing her, Clearview did not facilitate the exercise of the complainant's rights. Finally, it is apparent from the company's privacy policy that it limits the exercise of the right of access to data collected during the twelve months preceding the request and restricts the exercise of this right to twice a year. However, the company's confidentiality policy does not specify the retention period of the data and it does not emerge from the documents in the file that the retention of the data in question would be limited to twelve months. It emerges from these elements that the company does not respond effectively to access requests addressed to it under Article 15 of the GDPR and does not facilitate the exercise of the right of access by data subjects. These facts constitute a breach of Articles 12 and 15 of the Rules. 3.A breach of the obligation to respect the right to erasure Article 17 of the GDPR provides: ""The data subject has the right to obtain from the controller the erasure, as soon as possible, of personal data concerning him and the controller has the obligation to erase these personal data as soon as possible, when one of the following grounds applies: \[…\] the personal data have been the subject of unlawful processing "". It appears from referral no.20012263 that the complainant received no response from the company regarding the erasure of her data that she had requested from the company. However, since the Commission considers that the processing carried out cannot be based on any valid legal basis with regard to European regulations, the erasure was automatic. This fact constitutes a breach of section 17 of the Rules. Consequently, the company Clearview AI, located 214 W 29TH ST in NEW YORK CITY (10001 - United States of America), is put on formal notice within a period of two (2) months from the notification of this decision. and subject to the measures it could already have adopted, to: - not to proceed without a legal basis to the collection and processing of personal data relating to data subjects who are on French territory as part of the operation of the facial recognition software that it markets, and in particular, to delete all the personal data of these people (after responding to requests for access already made, if applicable); - facilitate the exercise of the rights of data subjects and in particular, respond effectively to the request for access made by the complainant in question; - grant the request for erasure made by the complainant in question; - justify to the CNIL that all of the aforementioned requests have been complied with, and this within the allotted time. At the end of this period, if Clearview AI has complied with this formal notice, this procedure will be considered closed and a letter will be sent to it to this effect.

On September 9, 2021, a delegation carried out an on-site check on the premises of the company FRANCETEST (hereinafter, ""the company"") in order to verify the compliance of the processing of personal data implemented by this last with Regulation No. 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of personal data (hereinafter, the ""RGPD"") and Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 modified relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter, the law ""Informatique et Libertés""). The control delegation noted that although the company took certain measures when it became aware of the data breach, the Francetest service still suffered from several security deficiencies which continued to pose a risk to data confidentiality. of a personal nature processed. By decision of October 4, 2021, the President of the Commission, on the basis of article 20 of the amended law of January 6, 1978, gave notice to the company FRANCETEST, located at 6, boulevard de la Marne, in Strasbourg (67000 ), to put an end within a period of two (2) months to the failure to ensure the security of personal data provided for in Article 32 of the GDPR. Pursuant to the last paragraph of II of article 20 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended, the President of the CNIL regularly convened the committee of the Commission for the purpose of ruling on her request to make her decision public. The bureau was convened for this purpose on October 11, 2021. After deliberation, the office considers that the publication of the formal notice decision is justified in particular because of the sensitivity of the data processed and the need to ensure the full information of all the people concerned by the processing. involved, as well as organizations using the services of the company FRANCETEST, on the existence of persistent breaches of data security. The office stresses that in addition to the results of the people concerned with antigenic tests for SARS-CoV-2, and which therefore make it possible to know whether a person is a carrier or not of this virus, the company FRANCETEST processes a large number of directly identifying data, including the social security number (NIR), data of a highly personal nature. The office stresses that the publicity of the formal notice decision is also justified to alert all actors in the world of health, whether they are data controllers or subcontractors, of the need to ensure as much as possible. security of the data they process and the risks that a lack of vigilance on their part can pose to this data. The office recalls in this regard that among the priorities identified by the CNIL for its control strategy for the year 2021, the processing of health data and, more particularly, the measures implemented to ensure their security. Consequently, the office of the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms decides to make public decision n ° MED-2021-093 of the President of the CNIL putting FRANCETEST in default. The Bureau recalls that this formal notice does not have the character of a sanction. If the company fully complies with the requirements of the formal notice within the time limit set, it will be the subject of a closure which will also be made public. Finally, both the aforementioned formal notice and this deliberation will no longer make it possible to identify the company by name after the expiration of a period of two years from their publication.

(hereinafter Google or the Company) is a limited liability company incorporated under U.S. law and headquartered in Moutain View, California, USA. A wholly owned subsidiary of ALPHABET since 2015, the company had a turnover of $109.7 billion (approximately EUR 96 billion) in 2017. It has more than 70 offices in about 50 countries and employs about 70,000 people worldwide. In France, it has one establishment, Google France Sarl, located at 8 rue de Londres in Paris (75009), which has approximately 600 employees and a turnover of approximately 325 million euros in 2017. Since its inception, the company has developed a variety of services for businesses and individuals (e.g. the Gmail email service, the Google Search search engine, YouTube etc.). It has also designed the operating system for Android mobile terminals, which includes the Google Play application store. In addition, the company is active in advertising sales. In 2016, this operating system had 27 million users in France. On 25 and 28 May 2018, the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (hereinafter CNIL or the Commission) received two collective complaints lodged under Article 80 of Regulation (EU) No 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD or the Regulation) by the None Of Your Business (hereinafter NOYB) association and the La Quadrature du Net (hereinafter LQDN) association respectively. Cumulatively, these complaints include the claims of 9974 individuals. In its complaint, the NOYB association states in particular that users of Android mobile terminals are required to accept Google's privacy policy and general terms and conditions of use of services and that without such acceptance, they will not be able to use their terminal. The LQDN association considers that, irrespective of the device used, Google does not have a valid legal basis for processing personal data for the purposes of behavioural analysis and advertising targeting. On 1 June 2018, the CNIL submitted the above-mentioned complaints to its European counterparts via the European information exchange system with a view to designating a possible lead authority in accordance with the provisions of Article 56 of the RGPD. In application of decision no. 2018-199C of 20 September 2018 of the President of the Commission, an online check was carried out on the following 21 September to verify the conformity of any processing relating to the use of the Android operating system for mobile equipment, including the creation of a Google account, with the law of 6 January 1978 relating to information technology, files and liberties (hereafter referred to as the Data Protection Act or the Act of 6 January 1978) and the RGPD. The online control report n° 2018-199/1 was notified to the companies GOOGLE LLC. and Google France SARL on September 24th and 25th, 2018. The two companies were also notified of the above-mentioned complaints by letters from the CNIL on September 28, 2018. In order to investigate these elements, the President of the CNIL appointed Mr. François Pellegrini as rapporteur on October 2, 2018, pursuant to Article 47 of the Act of January 6, 1978. At the end of his investigation, the rapporteur had Google LLC. and Google France SARL notified the companies Google LLC. and Google France SARL, on 22 October 2018, of a report detailing the breaches relating to Articles 6, 12 and 13 of the RGPD which he considered to be constituted in the present case. That report proposed to the restricted formation of the CNIL that it impose a financial penalty of EUR 50 million on Google LLC, which was made public. It was also proposed that the report should be published in a publication, newspaper or other medium designated by the panel. The report also included an invitation to attend the meeting of the restricted formation on 10 January 2019. The body was given one month to submit its written comments. By letter of 7 November 2018, the company requested a hearing with the rapporteur, which was not granted by letter of 13 November 2018. On the same date, the company also made a request for an in camera hearing and a postponement of the hearing, which was not granted, by letter dated 15 November 2018. On 22 November 2018, the company filed written comments on the report. These comments were answered by the rapporteur on 7 December 2018. By letter of 11 December 2018, the company, which had 15 days from receipt of the rapporteur's reply, requested the Chairman of the Panel to postpone the meeting and to extend the deadline for submitting further comments. The request was accepted by the Chairman of the restricted panel on 13 December 2018, who decided, firstly, to postpone the deadline for submitting these observations by two weeks - until 7 January - and, secondly, to postpone the meeting until 15 January 2019. On 4 January 2019, the company submitted new observations in response to those of the rapporteur. All of the observations were reiterated orally by the company and the rapporteur at the session of the restricted panel on 15 January 2019. II Reasons for the decision 1 On the competence of the CNIL Article 55(1) of the GPSR provides: Each supervisory authority shall be competent to exercise the tasks and powers conferred on it in accordance with this Regulation in the territory of the Member State to which it belongs . Article 56(1) of the EPMR provides: Without prejudice to Article 55, the supervisory authority of the principal or sole establishment of the controller or processor shall be competent to act as lead supervisory authority regarding the cross-border processing carried out by that controller or processor, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 60 . The company maintains first of all that the CNIL is not competent to carry out this procedure and that it should have forwarded the complaints received to the Irish Data Protection Commission (hereinafter DPC), which, as Google's lead authority, would be responsible for dealing with complaints relating to cross-border processing, in accordance with the cooperation procedure laid down in Article 60 of the DPC. The company considers that Google Ireland Limited should be considered as its principal place of business within the European Union for some of the cross-border processing it carries out, and in particular those that are the subject of the complaints received by the CNIL. Consequently, the data protection authority should, in its view, be regarded as its lead supervisory authority and, as such, be responsible for dealing with complaints received by the CNIL. As evidence of the fact that Google Ireland Limited is its principal place of business within the Union, it points out that this company has been Google's head office for its European operations since 2003 and that it is the entity in charge of several organisational functions necessary to carry out these operations for the Europe, Middle East and Africa zone (general secretariat, taxation, accounting, internal audit, etc.). It also states that the conclusion of all advertising sales contracts with clients based in the European Union is the responsibility of this company. The company employs more than 3,600 people and has, among other things, a dedicated team in charge of managing requests made within the European Union in relation to confidentiality and a privacy officer. Finally, it states that an operational and organisational reorganisation is under way to make Google Ireland Limited the data controller for certain processing of personal data concerning European nationals. It also considers that the definition of principal place of business must be distinguished from that of controller and that, if the European legislature had intended the concept of principal place of business to be interpreted as the place where decisions on processing operations are taken, it would have expressly so stated. It then considers that, given the cross-border nature of the processing of advertising personalisation, the significant number of Android users in Europe and the issues raised in relation to such processing, the cooperation and coherence mechanisms provided for in Articles 60, 64 and 65 of the RGPD should have applied. In particular, it specifies that the European Data Protection Committee (hereinafter EDPS ) should have been seized in case of doubt as to the determination of the lead authority. Finally, the company considers that any informal discussions that may have taken place between the other European supervisory authorities on this procedure are without legal effect as they took place without the presence of the EDPS. On Google Ireland Limited's status as principal place of business (a) as regards a controller established in several Member States, the place of its central administration within the Union, unless decisions as to the purposes and means of processing personal data are taken at another establishment of the controller within the Union and that establishment has the power to enforce those decisions, in which case the establishment which has taken such decisions shall be regarded as the principal establishment . Recital 36 of the EPMR states: The principal establishment of a controller in the Union should be determined according to objective criteria and should involve the effective and actual exercise of management activities determining the main decisions as to the purposes and means of the processing in the context of a stable system. The restricted formation considers that it follows from these provisions that, in order to qualify as a principal place of business, the establishment concerned must have decision-making powers with regard to the personal data processing operations in question. The status of principal establishment presupposes the effective and real exercise of management activities which determine the main decisions as to the purposes and means of processing. Therefore, the existence of a principal establishment is assessed in concreto, in the light of objective criteria, and the principal establishment cannot automatically correspond to the head office of the controller in Europe. The restricted training notes that this analysis is also the one adopted by all European supervisory authorities, as attested by the EDPS guidelines of 5 April 2017 on the designation of a lead supervisory authority for a controller or processor (WP244). These guidelines state that: the central administration is the place where decisions are taken as to the purposes and means of processing personal data, and this place has the power to enforce those decisions. The restricted formation further notes that the same guidelines indicate that: The General Regulation does not allow for forum shopping . The conclusions cannot be based exclusively on statements by the organisation in question . The decision-making powers of Google Ireland Limited must therefore be assessed in order to determine whether it can be classified as a principal place of business. In that regard, the restricted formation notes that Google Ireland Limited does indeed have many financial and human resources which enable Google to provide services in Europe, in particular through the sale of advertising services. However, although that evidence attests to that participation, the restricted training considers that it does not allow Google Ireland Limited to be qualified as a principal place of business. The evidence provided does not in itself show that Google Ireland Limited had, at the date on which the proceedings were brought, any decision-making power as to the purposes and means of the processing covered by the privacy policy presented to the user when he created his account, when configuring his mobile telephone for Android. These elements only reveal the involvement of this entity in the context of different activities of the company (financial and accounting activities, sale of advertising space, contracting, etc.). The restricted training also notes that Google Ireland Limited is not mentioned in the Company's Privacy Policy dated 25 May 2018 as the entity where the main decisions are taken as to the purposes and means of processing covered by the privacy policy presented to the user when creating his account, when configuring his mobile phone under Android. It also points out that Google Ireland Limited has not appointed a data protection officer who would be responsible for any processing of personal data that it might carry out in the European Union. The Commission further notes that the Android operating system is developed solely by Google LLC. Finally, the restricted formation notes that the company itself indicated, by letter dated 3 December 2018 addressed to the CPD, that the transfer of responsibility from Google LLC. to Google Ireland Limited for certain processing of personal data concerning European nationals would be finalised on 31 January 2019. It subsequently indicated that it would update its privacy policy, which will come into force on 22 January 2019. In the light of all these elements, the restricted formation considers that Google Ireland Limited cannot be considered as the principal place of business of Google LLC. in Europe within the meaning of Article 4(16) of the RGPD, since it has not been established that it has a decision-making power with regard to the processing covered by the privacy policy presented to the user at the time of the creation of his account when configuring his mobile phone under Android. In the absence of a lead institution allowing the identification of a lead authority, the CNIL was competent to initiate this procedure and to exercise all of its powers under Article 58 of the RGPD. (b) On the application of cooperation and consistency procedures In the first place, the company argues that the CNIL should have referred the matter to the EDPS because of the uncertainty as to which supervisory authority should act as lead authority. The restricted formation considers first of all that the absence of a principal place of business of a controller within the European Union does not in itself create uncertainty as to the identification of a supervisory authority that can act as lead authority. It only results from the absence of a principal place of business that the identification of a lead authority is not necessary and that the one-stop-shop mechanism is not intended to apply. The restricted formation then notes that the CNIL immediately communicated the complaints received to all the supervisory authorities, via the European information exchange system, with a view to identifying a possible lead authority, in accordance with the provisions of Article 56 of the RGPD. The restricted formation notes that, in the context of this procedure, no supervisory authority, nor the Chairman of the Committee, has deemed it necessary to refer the matter to the EDPS because of uncertainty as to the identification of the lead authority or the competence of the CNIL. It further notes that the analysis concluding that Google LLC. had no principal place of business in Europe for the processing operations covered by the complaints, and the resulting lack of a lead authority, was shared by the CPD. The Commission thus notes that the DPC publicly stated on 27 August 2018 - in a press article in the Irish Times - that it was not the lead authority for the processing operations that could be carried out by the company: the DPC is not Google's 'principal regulator' (nor, in data protection terms, its 'lead supervisor') \[...\] Google LLC, a US company, is the controller and Google has no access to the one-stop-shop mechanism. \[…\]. The current position is that Google is subject to the control of all European regulators \[...\] . It does not therefore follow from the investigation that there would have been any doubts or diverging views among the supervisory authorities that would have required a referral to the EDPS under Article 65 of the GDMP. Moreover, taking into account the guidelines already adopted at European level to guide national authorities in identifying the possible lead authority, there was no new issue justifying a referral to the EDPS by the CNIL under Article 64. In view of all these elements, the restricted formation considers that the CNIL was not obliged to refer the matter to the EDPS with a view to identifying a lead authority. Secondly, while the company argues that the CNIL should have cooperated in the investigation of complaints and in the follow-up to be given to them, the restricted formation recalls, as mentioned above, that the CNIL communicated the complaints to all supervisory authorities of the European Union, via the European information exchange system, as soon as they were received, with a view to identifying a possible lead authority. The limited training thus shows that a cooperation procedure has indeed been initiated with the supervisory authorities, in accordance with the provisions of Article 56 of the PGRD, initially solely on the question of identifying the respective competences of these authorities. The restricted training notes that this stage of disseminating information and determining a possible lead authority is a prerequisite for the possible application of the one-stop-shop mechanism provided for in Article 60 of the GDMP. The training then notes that since this step and the resulting exchanges did not lead to the identification of a lead institution or, consequently, a lead authority, no other obligation of cooperation was subsequently imposed on the CNIL, in particular under article 60 of the RGPD. Lastly, the restricted formation recalls that, in the interests of consistency, in accordance with the guidelines set out in Article 63 of the RGPD, the CNIL informed and consulted its European counterparts on several occasions on the investigations it had carried out and took the utmost account of the guidelines adopted by the EDPS with a view to ensuring uniform application of the Regulation. In the light of these elements, the restricted training considers that the procedures for cooperation and consistency have not been disregarded. Moreover, the restricted training notes that, except where expressly provided for, which is not the case here as regards the determination of the lead authority, the supervisory authorities are not required to inform controllers when implementing cooperative actions or to enable them to participate in exchanges between authorities. 2. on procedure First, the company maintains that the admissibility of the complaints filed by the associations None Of Your Business and La Quadrature du Net has not been established. The Panel considers that the question of the admissibility of the abovementioned complaints does not in any event have any influence on the legality of the present procedure, since referral to the Panel is not necessarily conditional on receipt of a complaint and may result from a self-referral by the Commission on the basis of the findings made by the Commission's services. It points out that the CNIL's task is to monitor the application of the Regulation and ensure compliance with it and that, to that end, it has the power to conduct investigations, in accordance with Article 57(1)(a) and (h) of the RGPD. Moreover, the restricted formation notes that Article 80 of the EPMR provides for the possibility for a person to mandate a non-profit association, which has been validly constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State, whose statutory objectives are of public interest and which is active in the field of the protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects in the context of the protection of personal data, to lodge a complaint on their behalf. With regard to LQDN, the restricted formation notes that it is a French association created on 3 January 2013. According to its statutes, the purpose of this association is, inter alia, to carry out actions to ensure the defence of fundamental rights and freedoms in the digital space \[...\]. As regards NOYB, the Commission notes that it is a non-profit-making association validly constituted on Austrian territory since 12 June 2017. According to its statutes, its purpose is, inter alia, to represent the rights and interests of users in the digital field (including consumer rights, fundamental rights of privacy, data protection, freedom of expression, freedom of information and the fundamental right to an effective remedy). The training also notes that these two associations have received a representation mandate under Article 80 of the DPMR from the persons who have seized them. Secondly, the company argues that the proceedings brought against it infringed its right to a fair trial as provided for, inter alia, in article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. On this point, it maintains, firstly, that the report proposing a penalty and the rapporteur's replies to its observations were sent to it solely in French and, secondly, that the refusal to extend the deadline for submitting its initial observations limited the time available to it to prepare its defence. It also considers that the postponement of the sitting and the additional time finally granted to her to produce her second observations were still not sufficient. The panel notes first of all that the notification of a penalty report in French is in accordance with the legal obligation laid down in Article 111-1 of the Code on relations between the public and the administration, which provides that The use of the French language is prescribed in exchanges between the public and the administration, in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 94-665 of 4 August 1994 on the use of the French language. Moreover, there is no legal or supranational provision requiring the CNIL to translate the documents it produces. In addition, the company has an establishment on French territory, the company Google France SARL. This company has several hundred employees and has been notified of all the documents relating to the procedure. It also notes that the main documents supporting the procedure (Confidentiality rules, Terms of use, etc.) were the company's own documents, which are also available in English on other media. In the light of these elements, the Panel considers that the company had in any event sufficient material and human resources to ensure that the documents were translated into English in sufficient time to enable it to examine them and make its comments within the time limit set for it. The Panel then recalls that Article 75 of Decree 2005-1309 of 20 October 2005 as amended provides that the controller has a period of one month to make comments in response to the report sent to it, followed by a further period of fifteen days after the deadline set for the rapporteur to respond. The restricted panel underlines that the requests made by the company on 11 December 2018 for an extension of the deadline for submitting its comments in response to the elements provided by the rapporteur and for a postponement of the meeting were granted. This postponement gave the company an additional 15 days to produce its second observations in relation to the initial deadline and thus prepare its defence for the restricted panel session. It was also able to present its oral observations on the day of the restricted panel session in addition to its written submissions. Finally, the panel points out that the findings of fact in the present procedure mainly concerned institutional documents drawn up by the company itself. In the light of these elements, the Panel considers that Google LLC.'s rights of defence have been guaranteed. 3. on the scope of the investigations In its defence, the company argues first of all that the rapporteur has confused the Android operating system with the Google account, despite the fact that they are separate services which carry out different processing activities. In particular, it states that when configuring their mobile device under Android, users have a clear choice whether or not to create a Google account and that the Privacy Policy explains to them how Google services can be used with or without a Google account (e.g. viewing YouTube videos without creating an account etc.). She then argues that the scope of control chosen by the CNIL - namely the creation of a Google Account when configuring a new device using the Android operating system - is limited in that it represents a case that concerns only 7% of users. Finally, it states that the findings were made on an older version of the Android operating system. First of all, the limited training indicates that it does not call into question the existence of separate services, linked respectively to the Android operating system and to the Google Account, implementing different processing activities. However, it observes that the facts covered by the investigations correspond to the scenario chosen to carry out the online monitoring, namely the path of a user and the documents to which he could have had access during the initial configuration of his mobile equipment using the Android operating system. This path included the creation of an account. These facts therefore relate to the treatments covered by the privacy policy presented to the user when he created his account during the configuration of his mobile phone using Android. Next, while it is true that the user does indeed have the choice to create an account and has the possibility to use some of the company's services without having to create an account, the Commission notes, however, that when configuring a device under Android, the possibility of creating a Google account or connecting to an already existing account appears naturally at the beginning of the configuration process, without any specific action on the part of the user. The user is also prompted to create or sign in to a Google Account because when he clicks on the Learn More or Ignore links available at this stage of device configuration, he is presented with the following information: Your device works best with a Google Account, If you don't have a Google Account, you will not be able to do the following \[...\] Enable device protection features. The restricted training thus considers that this path, when creating an account, creates a continuum of use between the treatments operated by the operating system and those operated through the Google Account, and justifies the scenario chosen for online control. However, this sequence of information and choices presented to the user does not preclude a differentiated analysis of the different processing activities involved under the legal framework on the basis of all the facts found in this monitoring scenario. Moreover, with regard to the company's observations that this scenario would only concern 7% of users - most users of a device running Android connecting to a pre-existing account - the restricted training reminds that under the terms of Article 11.I.2 of the French Data Protection Act, the CNIL has a broad discretionary power as to the scope of the controls it may undertake. A specific control scenario, such as the one used in the present case, may make it possible to make findings that reflect a more comprehensive confidentiality policy. Moreover, the Panel notes that the company states in its submission dated 7 December 2018 that: the scope of the processing of personal data that occurs for Google Account holders when using a device running Android is largely similar to the processing that occurs for Google Account holders when they use Google services on a computer or device not running Android and that \[.Providing the same Privacy Policy and Terms of Service helps ensure consistency and user awareness and, importantly, serves as a reminder to existing account holders of the nature of the data collection and the purposes for which it is collected. Consequently, users who would configure their mobile phone under Android by associating an existing account to it are, with regard to the information communicated to them, in a similar situation to users who would create an account. Finally, with regard to the version of the Android operating system used to make the findings, the restricted training notes that the argument put forward by the company is irrelevant since the documents provided by the company show that a user's path is similar in a more recent version of the operating system. Moreover, the restricted panel notes that the statistics on the distribution of the use of successive versions of the Android operating system, made available on the official website of Android developers (https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/), show that the version used during the monitoring is among the most frequently used versions (statistics covering a period of one week in October 2018 based on the connection data of the terminals that have connected to the Google Play Store). 4. on the failure to comply with transparency and information obligations Article 12(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation provides: 1. the controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 as well as any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 regarding the processing operation to the data subject in a concise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible manner, in clear and simple terms, in particular for any information specifically intended for a child. Information shall be provided in writing or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means. Where the data subject so requests, the information may be provided orally, provided that the identity of the data subject is proved by other means . Article 13(1) of the same text provides that: Where personal data relating to a data subject are obtained from the data subject, the controller shall provide him/her with all the following information at the time when the data are obtained : the identity and contact details of the controller and, where appropriate, of the representative of the controller ; where applicable, the contact details of the Data Protection Officer ; the purposes of the processing operation for which the personal data are intended and the legal basis of the processing operation; where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party ; the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any; and where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to carry out a transfer of personal data to a third country or to an international organisation, and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission or, in the case of transfers as referred to in Articles 46 or 47 or in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the reference to appropriate or adequate safeguards and the means of obtaining a copy thereof or the place where it was made available; \[...\] . The Rapporteur considers that the information provided to users by society does not meet the objectives of accessibility, clarity and comprehensibility laid down in Article 12 and that certain information made mandatory by Article 13 is not provided to users. In defence, the company considers that the information it disseminates to its users meets the requirements of Articles 12 and 13 of the RGPD. First of all, the company considers that the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use document, accessible when creating an account, constitutes first level information in line with the EDPS Guidelines on Transparency within the meaning of EU Regulation 2016/679 (WP260) of 25 May 2018. The EDPS clarifies that this document provides a good overview of the processing operations carried out and that the legal basis of the processing operations need not be mentioned in this first level of information. Information on the storage period of the data can be found in the Export and Delete Your Information section of the Privacy Rules. The company then argues that the information to be given to individuals must, in the light of Articles 12 and 13 of the Regulation, be assessed as a whole. It explains that the information it provides is also provided, in addition to the documents entitled Confidentiality Rules and Terms of Use, Confidentiality Rules and Terms of Use, through several other terms and conditions. It explains that additional information messages may appear when creating an account under each of the privacy settings. In addition, an email message is sent to users when they create an account stating that: You can change the privacy and security settings of your Google Account at any time, create reminders to remember to check your privacy settings, or check your security settings. This email message contains clickable links to a variety of settings tools. These other control tools, which are available to users after they create their account from the account management interface, include a tool called the Privacy Check-up that allows users to choose the privacy settings that are right for them, including personalized ads, position history, web activity, and applications. The company also features a Dashboard tool that allows users to see the full picture of their use of Google services such as Gmail or Youtube. Finally, the company points out that when a user has clicked on Create an account without having disabled the settings for personalized ads, a pop-up window confirming the creation of an account appears to remind the user that the account is configured to include personalization features. The company states that the user path is configured in this way to slow down the progress of users who would not have spontaneously chosen more privacy-protective settings. Beforehand, the restricted training takes note of the progress made in recent years by the company in its user information policy, in the direction of greater transparency and greater control over their data expected by users. For the following reasons, however, it considers that the requirements of the DPMR, the implementation of which must be assessed in the light of the concrete scope of the personal data processing operations in question, are not respected. First of all, the restricted training recalls that pursuant to Article 12 of the Regulation, information must be provided in an easily accessible form. This requirement of accessibility is further clarified by the Guidelines on Transparency, where the EDPS considered that ""A crucial aspect of the transparency principle highlighted in these provisions is that the data subject should be able to determine in advance what the scope and consequences of the processing operation include in order not to be taken unawares at a later stage as to how his or her personal data have been used"". ...\] In particular, with regard to complex, technical or unplanned data processing operations, the G29 position is that data controllers should ... define separately and clearly the main consequences of the processing: in other words, what will be the actual effect of the specific processing operation described in a privacy statement or notice on the data subject. The restricted training also recalls that the accessibility obligation of Article 12 is partly based on the ergonomic choices made by the controller. In the case in point, the restricted training notes that the general information architecture chosen by the company does not make it possible to comply with the obligations of the Regulation. Indeed, the information that must be communicated to individuals under Article 13 is excessively scattered in several documents: Confidentiality Rules and Terms of Use, displayed during account creation, then Terms of Use and Confidentiality Rules, which are accessible in a second step by means of clickable links in the first document. These different documents contain buttons and links that must be activated to view additional information. Such an ergonomic choice leads to a fragmentation of information, forcing the user to multiply the number of clicks necessary to access the different documents. The user must then carefully consult a large amount of information before being able to identify the relevant paragraph(s). However, the user's work does not stop there, as he will still have to cross-check and compare the information collected in order to understand what data is being collected according to the different settings he may have chosen. The restricted training notes that, given this architecture, some information is difficult to find. For example, in the case of advertising personalization treatments, to know what information is collected from him for this purpose, a user must perform many actions and combine several documentary resources. First of all, the user must read the general document Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, then click on the More Options button and then on the Learn More link to display the Advertisement Personalization page. He will then have access to a first description of the treatment relating to the personalization of the advertisement which proves to be incomplete. In order to complete the information regarding the data processed for this purpose, the user will have to consult in full the section on offering personalised services contained in the Privacy Policy document, which can be accessed from the general document Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Likewise, with regard to the processing of geolocation data, the restricted training notes that the user is required to follow the same path devoid of any intuitive character with regard to the information relating to geolocation data. The user will have to complete the following steps: Consult the Confidentiality Rules and Terms of Use, click on More Options and then on the Learn More link to display the Position History page and read the text displayed. However, as this text is only a short description of the processing, to access the rest of the information, the user must return to the Privacy Policy and consult the section Information about your geographical location. The information will still not be complete since this section contains several clickable links relating to the various sources used to geolocate it. In the two cases described, five actions are necessary for the user to access the information related to the personalization of the ads and six for the geolocation. The restricted training also points out that if the user wishes to have information on the retention periods of his personal data, he must first consult the Privacy Rules found in the main document, then go to the section entitled Export and delete your information and finally click on the hyperlink click here contained in a general paragraph on retention periods. It is therefore only after four clicks that the user accesses this information. Moreover, the restricted training notes that the title chosen by the company to Export and delete your information does not easily allow the user to understand that this is a section allowing access to the information relating to the retention periods. Consequently, the restricted formation considers in this case that the multiplication of the necessary actions, combined with a choice of non-explicit titles does not meet the requirements of transparency and accessibility of information. All of these factors result in an overall lack of accessibility of the information provided by the company in the context of the processing operations in question. Secondly, the restricted formation considers that the clear and comprehensible nature of the information provided, as required by Article 12 of the GDMP, must be assessed taking into account the nature of each processing operation in question and its concrete impact on the data subjects. First of all, it is essential to stress that the data processing operations carried out by the controller are particularly massive and intrusive. The data collected by Google come from a wide variety of sources. This data is collected both from the use of the telephone, from the use of the company's services, such as the Gmail email service or the Youtube video platform, but also from data generated by user activity when they visit third party sites using Google services, thanks in particular to Google analytics cookies deposited on these sites. In this respect, the Privacy Policy shows that at least twenty services offered by the company are likely to be involved in the processing, which may concern data such as web browsing history, application usage history, data stored locally on the equipment (such as address books), equipment geolocation, etc. As a result, a large amount of data is processed as part of these services via or in connection with the Android operating system. The investigation of the case shows that, in addition to data from external sources, the company processes at least three categories of data: data produced by the individual (for example, name, password, telephone number, e-mail address, means of payment, content created, imported or received, such as writings, photos or videos) ; data generated by his or her activity (e.g. IP address, unique user identifiers, mobile network data, data related to wireless networks and Bluetooth devices, timestamps of actions performed, geolocation data, technical data of the devices used including data related to sensors (accelerometer, etc.), videos viewed, searches performed, browsing history, purchases, applications used, etc.); data derived or inferred from data provided by that person or his activity. With respect to this category, the Privacy Rules list a number of purposes that can only be accomplished by generating data from the other two categories of data. For example, the personalization of the ads that the company creates requires inferring the users' interests from their activity in order to be able to offer them to advertisers. In the same way, the purposes of providing personalized content, research and recommendations require inferring new information from the information declared, produced or generated by the person's activity. Moreover, while the very large number of data processed makes it possible to characterize the massive and intrusive nature of the processing carried out, the very nature of some of the data described, such as geolocation data or the content consulted, reinforces this observation. Considered in isolation, the collection of each of these data is likely to reveal with a significant degree of precision many of the most intimate aspects of people's lives, including their habits, tastes, contacts, opinions and even their movements. The result of the combination of these data considerably reinforces the massive and intrusive nature of the processing in question. Consequently, it is in the light of the specific characteristics of these processing operations of personal data as just recalled that the clear and comprehensible character, within the meaning of Article 12 of the GDPR, of the information provided for in Article 13 of the Regulation must be assessed. The restricted formation considers that these requirements are not met in this case. Specifically, the restricted training notes that the information provided by the company does not enable users to understand sufficiently the specific consequences of the processing operations for them. Indeed, the purposes announced in the various documents are described as follows: to offer personalised services in terms of content and announcements, to ensure the security of products and services, to provide and develop services, etc... . They are too generic with regard to the scope of the processing implemented and its consequences. This is also the case when it is indicated to users too vaguely: The information we collect is used to improve the services offered to all our users. ...\] The information we collect and the use we make of it depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy settings. \[...\] The information we collect and how we use it depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy settings. As a result, the description of the purposes does not allow users to measure the extent of the processing and the degree of intrusion into their privacy that they are likely to take. In particular, it considers that such information is not provided in a clear manner, either at the first level of information provided to users through the document entitled Confidentiality rules and conditions of use, or at the other levels of information offered by the company. The restricted training also notes that the description of the data collected, which could be of such a nature as to clarify the scope of these purposes and to avoid the user being caught unprepared at a later stage as to how his data have been used and combined, is particularly imprecise and incomplete, both in the analysis of the first level of information and in the analysis of the other documents provided. For example, the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use document and the Privacy Policy document state: This may include more complex information (...) such as the ads you find most useful, the people you are most interested in on the Web, or the YouTube videos you might like. In view of the above, the restricted training considers that the user is not in a position, especially when reading the first level of information presented in the Privacy Rules and Conditions of Use, to measure the impact of the main processing operations on his privacy. While it notes that exhaustive information at the first level would be counterproductive and would not comply with the transparency requirement, it considers that the first level should contain terms that objectify the number and scope of the processing operations carried out. It also considers that it would be possible, by means of other types of presentation arrangements adapted to data combination services, to provide an overall view of the characteristics of this combination from the stage of the Confidentiality Rules according to the purposes pursued. The lack of clarity and comprehensibility should also be noted with regard to the mention of the legal basis of processing operations for personalising advertising. Indeed, the company firstly states in the Privacy Rules: We ask for your permission to process your information for specific purposes, and you are free to withdraw your consent at any time. For example, we ask for your permission to provide you with personalized services, such as advertisements \[...\] . The legal basis used here is therefore consent. However, the company further adds to rely on legitimate interest, in particular to carry out marketing actions to make our services known to users and especially to use advertising to make many of our services available free of charge to users. The restricted formation stresses that, although the company has indicated before it that the only legal basis for processing relating to personalised advertising is consent, the instruction states that this clarification is not made known to users. The above wording does not allow users to clearly understand the distinction between properly personalised advertising, based on the combination of multiple user data, which according to the company is based on consent, and other forms of targeting, for example using the navigation context, based on legitimate interest. The restricted training underlines the particular importance of the requirement for clarity with regard to these processing operations, given their place in society's processing operations and their impact on individuals in the digital economy. With respect to information on retention periods, the limited training notes that the How Google's information is retained page contains four categories: Information retained until you delete it; Information with an expiration date; Information retained until you delete your Google Account; Information that is kept for a long period of time for specific reasons. However, we note that for the last category, only a very general explanation of the purpose of such retention is provided and no specific time period or criteria used to determine the length of time is specified. This information is one of those which must be provided to persons under Article 13(2)(a) of the Regulation. Finally, while the company argues that multiple information tools are made available to users concurrently and after the creation of their account, the restricted training notes that these modalities do not meet the transparency and information requirements of Articles 12 and 13 of the RGPD. First of all, the restricted training notes that the tools referred to by the company do indeed contribute to a certain extent to the objective of transparency throughout the life of the account and the use of Google's services. However, the restricted training considers that they do not sufficiently contribute to the information provided for in Article 13, which must occur at the time the data in question are obtained. As recalled in the EDPS Transparency Guidelines, Article 13 specifies the information to be provided to data subjects at the beginning of the processing cycle. If data other than those strictly necessary for the creation of the account are collected throughout the life of the account, such as browsing or purchase history, the moment of its creation marks the entry of the user into the ecosystem of Google's services, the particularly massive and intrusive nature of which has been recalled above. This stage marks the beginning of a multitude of processing operations: collection, combination, analysis, etc. Therefore, insofar as the process of creating the account is crucial in understanding the processing operations and their impact, and since the proposed user path itself invites the data subject to focus his or her attention at this stage, the information provided for in Article 13 of the Regulation which takes place at this point must, in itself, be sufficient in the light of the requirements resulting from that provision and from Article 12 of the Regulation. Moreover, both the pop-up window appearing when the account is created and the electronic message sent as soon as the account is created contain only summary or highly targeted information on the processing operations carried out and cannot be regarded as sufficient prior information. This Google Account is set up to include personalization features (such as recommendations and personalized ads) that are based on information stored in your account. The email message indicates the main features of the Google Account and the existence of control tools. The privacy check-up tool essentially allows the user to set up the information collected, such as browsing history or locations visited. Finally, the Dashboard consists of an information panel that groups together for each Google service an overview of the account holder's usage habits. Nevertheless, these privacy check-up and dashboard tools can only be used, as well as the email mentioned above, after the account creation stage, which is essential for user information as mentioned above. Moreover, although their existence and interest are made known to users, they presuppose an active and proactive approach on their part. For these reasons, these tools cannot be considered to provide sufficient information for the application of Article 13 of the Regulation. In the light of all these factors, the restricted group considers that a failure to comply with the transparency and information obligations provided for in Articles 12 and 13 of the Regulation is a breach of the Regulation. 5. 5. Failure to have a legal basis for the processing operations carried out in the context of the Regulation. Article 6 of the DPMR provides that: Processing is lawful only if and insofar as at least one of the following conditions is met : the data subject has consented to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes ; processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract; processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject ; processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person ; processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data prevail, in particular where the data subject is a child . The company was criticised for not validly obtaining the consent of individuals for the processing of personalised advertising. It was also considered that the company could not rely on a legitimate interest in such processing operations. In its defence, the company stated that it relied solely on consent for advertising personalization treatments. Article 4(11) of the Regulation specifies what is meant by consent: ""any freely given specific, specific, informed and unambiguous expression of his or her wishes by which the data subject signifies his or her agreement, by means of a declaration or a clear positive act, to personal data relating to him or her being processed"". Article 7 of the same text lays down the conditions applicable to it : 1. In cases where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has given his or her consent to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. 2. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written statement which also relates to other matters, the request for consent shall be in a form which clearly distinguishes it from those other matters, in a form which is comprehensible and easily accessible, and formulated in clear and simple terms. No part of such a statement which constitutes a breach of this Regulation shall be binding. 3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent shall not jeopardise the lawfulness of the processing operation based on the consent given prior to such withdrawal. The data subject shall be informed thereof before giving his or her consent. Withdrawing consent is as simple as giving consent. 4. In determining whether consent is freely given, utmost account should be taken of, inter alia, whether the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is contingent upon it. In the first place, the company asserts that the consent of users is informed. It considers that simple and clear information is presented to the user when creating an account and allows the user to be aware of how the company uses the data for the purposes of personalising advertising. The Company refers in particular to the summary entitled Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, the sections dedicated to the personalization of advertisements contained in the Privacy Policy and the additional information message entitled Advertising Personalization appearing in the account creation settings options. Second, the Company affirms that user consent is specific and unambiguous. In particular, the Company argues that when setting up the account, the user is given the opportunity to make a choice as to whether or not the advertisement personalization will be displayed. The company considers that this possibility allows the user to express consent to the use of his data independently of the other choices he may express with respect to other purposes related to the processing associated with the Google account (e.g. YouTube search history). It also considers that the methods of collecting consent for the purposes of personalizing the ads it puts in place are consistent with the recommendations of the CNIL of December 5, 2013 on cookies. In particular, it specifies that brief information is available on the personalization of ads followed by an ""I accept"" button (the Privacy Rules and Terms of Use), preceded by a ""more options"" button that gives users the possibility of disabling several processing operations, including for the purposes of personalizing ads. It also maintains that the solution admitted in the public notice of the President of the CNIL No. MED-2018-023 of November 29, 2018 allows the user to consent to all purposes via a button accept all . Finally, it considers that explicit consent for the processing of data for the purposes of personalising advertising, within the meaning of Article 9(2)(a) of the RGPD, could not be required as long as it is not sensitive data. As to the enlightened character Beforehand, the restricted training specifies that this enlightened nature must be examined in the light of previous developments concerning the lack of transparency and information for users when creating their account. It considers that the shortcomings previously identified necessarily have an impact on the information provided to users to ensure the informed nature of consent. The restricted training indicates that the EDPS Guidelines of 10 April 2018 on consent within the meaning of Regulation 2016/679 (WP250) specify that the controller must ensure that consent is provided on the basis of information that allows data subjects to easily identify who the data controller is and understand what they are consenting to. It\] must clearly describe the purpose of the data processing for which consent is sought. These guidelines also specify that: For consent to be informed, it is necessary to inform the data subject of certain elements that are crucial to make a choice. ...\] At least the following information is necessary in order to obtain meaningful consent ...: the identity of the controller, the purpose of each of the processing operations for which consent is sought, the (types of) data collected and used, the existence of the right to withdraw consent, information on the use of the data for automated decision making \[...\] and information on the possible risks associated with the transmission of the data due to the lack of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards \[...\] . As it may have pointed out in relation to the failure to comply with transparency and information obligations, the restricted panel considers that information on advertising personalisation processing operations is excessively disseminated in separate documents and as such is not easily accessible. In this respect, the restricted training refers to previous developments on the multiple actions which must be taken by a user who wishes to be informed of the available information on processing operations relating to the personalisation of advertising. Moreover, as has also been noted in relation to the failure to comply with transparency obligations, the information provided is not sufficiently clear and comprehensible in that it is difficult for a user to have an overall understanding of the processing operations to which he may be subject and their scope. By way of illustration, the information published in the Personalisation of advertisements section, accessible from the document Confidentiality rules and conditions of use via the More options button, contains the following statement: Google may show you ads based on your activity within Google services (for example, in search or on YouTube, as well as on Google partner websites and applications). Restricted training notes that it is not possible to learn about the Google services, sites and applications to which the company refers, for example through clickable links. Consequently, the user is not able to understand the personalization processing of advertising to which they are subject, as well as its scope, even though this processing involves a plurality of services (for example: Google search, YouTube, Google home, Google maps, Playstore, Google photo, Google play, Google analytics, Google translation, Play books) and the processing of a large amount of personal data. Users are not able to have a fair perception of the nature and volume of the data that is collected. In view of these elements, the restricted training considers that users' consent for the processing of advertising personalisation is not sufficiently informed. Regarding the specific and unambiguous nature of consent Recital 32 of the Regulation provides that: Consent must be given by a clear positive act by which the data subject freely, specifically, knowingly and unambiguously expresses his or her agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her \[...\]. There can therefore be no consent in the event of silence, default boxes or inactivity. Recital 43 of the GDPR states that: Consent is presumed not to have been freely given if separate consent cannot be given to different personal data processing operations although this is appropriate in the case in question . The EDPS Guidelines on Consent referred to above specify that: In order to comply with the specific nature of consent, the controller must ensure that : This means that a controller seeking consent for various specific purposes should provide separate consent for each purpose so that users can give specific consent for specific purposes. In the present case, the restricted training notes that when the user creates an account, he or she has the possibility to change some of the settings associated with the account. To access these settings, the user must click on the more options button before the Create Account button. The restricted training also notes that the account personalization parameters, which contain the choice of displaying personalized ads, are pre-ticked by default, which, unless otherwise stated, indicates the user's agreement to the processing of his data for the purposes mentioned (e.g. YouTube search history, display of personalized ads, etc.). The user has the possibility of unchecking these parameters if he does not wish such processing to be carried out. The restricted training notes that, at the time of account creation, if the user does not click on the more options button to set up his account, he must check the boxes I accept the Google terms of use and I agree that my information will be used as described above and detailed in the privacy policy . Then, he or she must press the Create Account button. A pop-up window will appear, titled Simple confirmation, which contains the following text This Google Account is set up to include personalization features (such as recommendations and personalized ads), which are based on information stored in your account. To change your personalization settings and the information saved in your account, select More options . If More Options is not clicked, then the user must select the Confirm button to complete the account creation. In view of the above, Restricted Training notes that while the user has the ability to change the configuration of their account settings prior to account creation, a positive action on their part is required to access the account setup options. Thus, the user can completely create his account, and accept the treatments that are linked to it, in particular the treatments of personalization of the advertisement, without clicking on More options . Consequently, the user's consent in this case is not validly collected unless it is given by means of a positive act by which the person specifically and distinctly consents to the processing of his/her data for the purposes of personalising the advertisement in relation to the other purposes of processing. The restricted training also considers that the actions by which the user proceeds with the creation of his/her account - by ticking the boxes I accept the Google Terms of Use and agree to the use of my information as described above and detailed in the Privacy Policy and selecting Create an Account - are not to be considered as an expression of valid consent. The specific nature of the consent is not respected since the user, by these actions, agrees to all processing of personal data by the company, including the personalization of advertising. Furthermore, the restricted training notes that when he clicks on More options to access the configuration of his account parameters, these, and in particular the one relating to the display of personalised advertisements, are all pre-ticked by default. Also, the possibility given to users to configure their account settings does not result, in this case, in a positive action aimed at obtaining consent, but in an action aimed at allowing opposition to the processing. Finally, the restricted training notes that this analysis is corroborated by the G29 Guidelines on Consent, which state that: A controller must also be aware that consent cannot be obtained through the same action as when a data subject accepts a contract or the terms and conditions of a service. The DPMR does not allow controllers to provide default check boxes or opt-out options requiring action by the data subject to indicate his or her refusal (e.g. opt-out boxes). The restricted training notes in this respect that, while some user paths may include a functionality allowing the user to give mutual consent to the processing of his data for different related purposes, this facility can only be considered compliant if the different purposes of processing have been presented to him separately in advance and he has been able to give a specific consent for each purpose, by a clear positive act, with the boxes not being pre-ticked. In order for this type of user pathway to be considered compliant, the possibility to give specific consent for each purpose must be offered to individuals before the possibility to accept or refuse everything, without them having to take any particular action to access it, such as clicking on more options . In view of the above, the restricted training considers that this type of user path offers different guarantees from those proposed in this case, as it allows the user to give specific and distinct consent to the processing of his/her data for a specific purpose, by means of a clear positive act, and this possibility is offered to him/her immediately and prior to the functionality to accept everything. Therefore, in this case, by being authorized and masked by default, the processing of advertising personalization cannot be considered as having been accepted by the user by a specific and univocal positive act. Secondly, if the company maintains that the methods for collecting consent for the purposes of personalizing advertisements that it implements are in compliance with the recommendations of the CNIL of December 5, 2013 regarding cookies, the restricted training reminds that the rules specifically applicable to cookies related to targeted advertising operations are set by the separate provisions of Article 32-II of the French Data Protection Act, resulting from the transposition of the ePrivacy Directive of July 12, 2002 (amended by Directive 2009/136/EC). The invocation of the Recommendation of 5 December 2013 is consequently, and in any event, inoperative. Thirdly, contrary to what Google maintains, the requirements laid down as regards the collection of consent are not intended to establish a consent regime which would be more protective than that imposed by the GDMP and which would be wrongly defined in the light of the criteria imposed for the collection of consent applicable to the processing of so-called sensitive personal data. The restricted formation notes that the modalities of expression of consent have been clarified and defined by Article 4(11) of the Regulation, which states that consent shall mean: any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous expression of his or her wishes by which the data subject signifies his or her agreement, by a declaration or a clear positive act, to personal data relating to him or her being processed. The same modalities for the expression of consent apply in the same way, whether consent is obtained, under Article 6 of the GDMP, for the implementation of a processing operation for a specific purpose, or whether consent is obtained, under Article 9 of the GDMP, to lift the prohibition in principle on the processing of so-called sensitive personal data . Therefore, in order to be considered valid, the consent obtained must be a specific, informed and unambiguous expression of will, which, as the restricted panel has previously pointed out, is not the case here. In the light of all those factors, the restricted formation considers that the consent on which the company relies for the personalisation of advertising is not validly obtained. III - Sanctions and advertising Article 45-III 7° of the law of 6 January 1978 provides : Where the data controller or its processor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 referred to above or from this Act, the Chairman of the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés may also, where appropriate after sending him the warning provided for in I of this Article or, where appropriate in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted formation of the Commission with a view to pronouncing, after an adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures:...\]: 7° Except in cases where the treatment is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding EUR 10 million or, in the case of an undertaking, 2% of the total annual worldwide turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is the higher. In the circumstances set out in Article 83(5) and (6) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016, these ceilings are increased to EUR 20 million and 4 % of that turnover respectively. In determining the amount of the fine, the restricted formation shall take into account the criteria set out in Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. The company considers that an administrative fine of EUR 50 million is disproportionate. It points out that a formal notice would have enabled it to take steps to comply and that it does not appear that the direct imposition of an administrative fine is the most appropriate corrective measure. The Commission further considers that not all the criteria set out in Article 83 of the RGPD have been taken into account in the assessment of the proposed fine. In this respect, it refers in particular to the impossibility to take corrective measures due to the absence of a prior notice. The company further points to the low number of users affected by the infringements and indicates that out of \[...\] people who configure a device under the Android operating system per day, only \[...\] people create an account. First of all, the restricted panel notes that, pursuant to Article 45 of Law No. 2018-493 of 20 June 2018, the President of the CNIL has the right to take legal action and can therefore choose, depending on the circumstances of the case, the follow-up to be given to the investigations by closing a file, issuing a formal notice or by seizing the restricted panel with a view to taking one or more corrective measures, without it being up to the restricted panel to decide on the course of action chosen by the President. The restricted panel, thus seized, is then fully competent to rule on the materiality and the qualification of the facts, then to assess whether the failures that it would have characterized justify, in its very principle, the pronouncement of one of the corrective measures mentioned in III of article 45 of the law of January 6, 1978 and, finally, to rule on the amount of a possible fine. Furthermore, the restricted panel recalls that if an administration, when a decision is taken in the light of a set of criteria laid down by a text, must take into account all of these criteria, it is not required in the grounds for its decision to give an opinion on each of them but may confine itself to mentioning those it considers relevant and the corresponding factual elements. In the case in point, the restricted formation considers that the facts and failures referred to above justify the imposition of an administrative fine on the company for the following reasons. Firstly, the panel wishes to stress the particular nature of the breaches of the lawfulness of the processing and of the obligations of transparency and information. Indeed, Article 6 of the RGPD - which defines the cases in which processing is lawful - is a central provision of the protection of personal data in that it allows processing to be carried out only if one of the six conditions listed is met. Transparency and information obligations are also essential in that they condition the exercise of individuals' rights and thus enable them to retain control over their data. In this respect, both Article 6 and Articles 12 and 13 are among the provisions whose disregard is most severely sanctioned in Article 83(5) of the GDMP. The restricted formation thus considers that the obligations provided for in terms of transparency and legal bases constitute fundamental guarantees enabling individuals to retain control over their data. Ignorance of these essential obligations therefore appears particularly serious, by their very nature alone. Secondly, the restricted panel notes that the breaches identified continue to date and are ongoing violations of the Regulation. This is neither a one-off failure by the company to comply with its obligations, nor is it a habitual breach which the controller has spontaneously put an end to since the matter was referred to the restricted panel. Thirdly, the seriousness of the breaches must be assessed in the light in particular of the purpose of the processing operations, their scope and the number of data subjects. In this respect, the restricted training notes that although, according to the company, the scenario adopted for the online investigations conducted by the CNIL directly corresponds to only 7% of its users, the number of persons concerned is, in itself, particularly large. It also points out that users who configure their mobile phone under Android by associating an existing account with it are, with regard to the documents communicated to them and therefore the violations of the Regulation, in a situation similar to those creating an account for the first time, which the company did not contest in its letter of 7 December 2018. Furthermore, the restricted formation recalls that the company is implementing data processing on a considerable scale in view of the predominant place occupied by the Android operating system on the French market for mobile operating systems and the proportion of use of computers by telephone users in France. Thus, the data of millions of users is processed by the company in this context. The processing covered by the privacy policy presented to users when they create their account - when configuring their mobile phone using Android - also appears to be of considerable scope in view of the number of services involved - at least twenty or so - and the variety of data processed via or in connection with the Android operating system. In addition to the data provided by the user himself when creating the account and using the operating system, the restricted training reminds us that a multitude of data resulting from his activity is also generated, such as web browsing history, application usage history, equipment geolocation, purchases etc. Likewise, data are deduced from information provided by the data subject or his activity, in particular in the context of personalising advertisements. It is therefore a large amount of particularly enlightening information on people's lifestyle habits, opinions and social interactions. Consequently, the data processed by the company has a direct impact on their identity and privacy. Moreover, the restricted training notes that multiple technological processes are used by the company to combine and analyze data from different services, applications or external sources. They undeniably have a multiplier effect on the precise knowledge that the company has of its users. As a result, the restricted formation believes that the company has combination operations with almost unlimited potential for massive and intrusive processing of user data. In view of the scope of the data processing operations - in particular the personalisation of advertising - and the number of data subjects, the restricted formation stresses that the breaches previously identified are particularly serious. A lack of transparency regarding these large-scale processing operations, as well as a lack of valid consent of users to the processing of personalised advertising, constitute substantial breaches of their privacy and run counter to the legitimate aspirations of individuals who wish to retain control over their data. In this respect, the strengthening of individuals' rights is one of the main thrusts of the Regulation. The European legislator recalls that the rapid development of technology and globalisation have created new challenges for the protection of personal data. The extent of the collection and sharing of personal data has increased significantly. Technology enables both private companies and public authorities to use personal data in their activities in an unprecedented way (...) Technology has transformed both the economy and social relations (recital 6). It thus underlines that these developments require a strong data protection framework (...) with rigorous enforcement, as it is important to create the trust and confidence that will allow the digital economy to develop throughout the internal market. Natural persons should have control over their personal data. (Recital 7). Finally, the European legislator regrets that Directive 95/46/EC has not avoided the widespread public perception that significant risks to the protection of natural persons remain, in particular with regard to the online environment. (recital 9). The restricted training considers, therefore, in view of the scale of the processing operations deployed and the overriding need for users to retain control over their data, that they must be put in a position to be sufficiently informed of the scope of the processing operations implemented and to give their valid consent to them, unless confidence in the digital ecosystem is fundamentally undermined. Fourthly, the restricted training wishes to emphasise that the shortcomings must be put into perspective with regard to the economic model of the company, in particular the place of processing of users' data for advertising purposes via the Android operating system. In view of the benefits that the company derives from these processing operations, the company must pay particular attention to its responsibility under the DPMR in their implementation. It follows from all of the above and from the criteria duly taken into account by the restricted training, in view of the maximum amount incurred, established on the basis of 4 % of the turnover indicated in point 2 of this Decision, that a financial penalty of EUR 50 million is justified, as well as an additional advertising penalty for the same reasons. Account shall also be taken of the predominant place occupied by the company on the market for operating systems, the seriousness of the infringements and the interest which this Decision represents in informing the public, in determining the duration of its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides : to impose a financial penalty on Google LLC in the amount of 50 (fifty) million euros; to send this decision to Google France Sarl with a view to its enforcement; to make its decision public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, which will be made anonymous at the end of a period of two years from its publication. The Chairman Jean-François CARREZ This decision may be appealed to the Council of State within four months of its notification. Nature of the decision: PENALTY Date of publication on legifrance: 22 January 2019"

The company having had the last word ; After deliberation, adopted the following decision: Facts and procedure The company SERGIC (hereafter the company) is specialized in real estate development, purchase, sale, rental and property management. It employs 486 people and in 2017 had a turnover of approximately 43 million euros. 2 For the needs of its activity, the company publishes the website www.sergic.com (hereafter the website) which allows applicants for the rental of a property to download the supporting documents necessary for the constitution of their file. 3 On August 12, 2018, the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties (hereinafter CNIL or the Commission) received a complaint from a user of the site. The complainant indicated that a change in the character X in the URL address composed as follows: https://www.crm.sergic.com/documents/upload/eresa/X.pdf, where X represents a whole number, had allowed him to access the supporting documents that he himself had downloaded via the site but also to those downloaded by other candidates for rental. In his complaint, the complainant provided several examples of URLs from which he was able to access materials downloaded by third parties. He stated that he informed the company of these facts as early as March 2018. 4 In application of decision no. 2018-186C of September 5, 2018 of the Chairman of the Commission, an online control mission and then a control mission at the company's premises were carried out on September 7 and 13, 2018 respectively. The purpose of these missions was to verify the compliance with the law of January 6, 1978 as amended (hereafter the Data Protection Act) and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereafter RGPD or the Regulation) of the processing of personal data accessible from the sergic.com domain or relating to personal data collected from the latter. 5 During the online monitoring engagement, the delegation found that by entering one of the URLs provided by the complainant, it was possible to download a tax notice with a different name than the complainant's name. The delegation then proceeded to download 9,446 documents by means of a script, including copies of identity cards, Vitale cards, tax notices, death certificates, marriage certificates, certificates of affiliation to social security, certificates issued by the family allowance fund, disability pension certificates, divorce judgments, account statements, bank statements and rent receipts. 6 The Company was informed on September 7, by the delegation of authority, of the existence of a security flaw on its site and an e-mail containing the type of URL addresses concerned by this security flaw was sent to it. 7. 7. On September 13, 2018, during an inspection visit to the company's premises, the CNIL delegation noted that the URL addresses provided by the complainant in his referral still allowed access to the documents in question. The company informed the delegation that the supporting documents downloaded by applicants for rental are recorded in a dedicated directory. It was specified that the entire directory had been made accessible by the security flaw. The findings showed that this directory contained 290,870 files on the day of the audit. The company further indicated that the documents provided by the candidates were not purged and that they were not reused at a later date, as the documents of the candidates who had accessed the rental were moved to another directory in the database. 8 The company confirmed to the delegation that a report informing them that documents were freely accessible from the site without prior authentication had been received in March 2018. The company stated that following this report, it had carried out an initial phase of analysis of the security flaw, which led to an action plan to be implemented from June 2018. She also indicated that an initial action to stop displaying URL addresses as they appeared at the time of the breach had been deployed a few days before the September 13 audit. The company then explained that a measure definitively ending the security breach was to be put into production on September 17, 2018. The company was notified of the September 7 and 13 minutes on September 17. 9 For the purposes of examining these elements, the Chairman of the CNIL appointed Mr. Éric PÉRÈS on February 1, 2019 as rapporteur on the basis of Article 47 of the Law of January 6, 1978. By letter dated February 1, 2019, the President of the CNIL informed the Company of this appointment. 10 At the end of his investigation, the rapporteur had the company SERGIC notified on February 5, 2019, a report detailing the breaches relating to articles 5 and 32 of the RGPD that he considered constituted in this case. 11 This report proposed to the restricted formation of the CNIL to pronounce against the company SERGIC a pecuniary sanction of 900,000 euros which would be made public. 12 The report was also attached to a notice convening the meeting of the restricted formation of April 11, 2019. The company had a period of one month in which to submit its written observations. On February 11, 2019, the Company requested that the meeting be held in camera. This request was granted in a letter dated February 22, 2019, insofar as certain items included in the proceedings are protected by business secrecy, as provided for in Article L 151-1 of the French Commercial Code. 13 On March 4, 2019, the Company filed written comments on the report. The rapporteur replied to these observations on March 15, 2019. On April 2, 2019, the company filed new observations in response to those of the rapporteur. 14 All of the observations were reiterated orally by the company and the rapporteur during the restricted training session of April 11, 2019. II - Reasons for the decision On the September 7, 2018 online request for the annulment of the findings 15 The company points out that during the online inspection of September 7, 2018, the agents of the CNIL proceeded to the extraction of files accessible from URL addresses composed as follows: https://www.crm.sergic.com/documents/upload/eresa/X.pdf whereas the provisions of Article 44 of the Data Protection Act only authorize the agents of the CNIL to consult data freely accessible or made accessible and that they do not, under any circumstances, make it possible to maintain in an automated data processing system in order to extract data by downloading them. 16 The Company therefore asks the restricted formation to declare null and void the observations contained in minutes no. 2018-186/1 of September 7, 2018. The restricted panel reminds that under the terms of paragraph 3 of III of Article 44 of the French Data Protection Act, the Commission's employees may, in particular, from an online public communication service, consult data that is freely accessible or made accessible, including by imprudence, negligence or the actions of a third party, if necessary by accessing and remaining in automated data processing systems for the time necessary for the findings; they may transcribe the data by any appropriate processing into documents that can be directly used for the purposes of control. 18 By downloading the files from the above-mentioned URL addresses, the CNIL agents did indeed proceed to a retranscription of the data and not to an extraction, insofar as the files were not moved from the company's database but were simply copied. The restricted formation considers that by downloading the files made freely accessible by the security flaw, the CNIL agents acted in strict compliance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 44, which does not list exhaustively the forms that can take the transcriptions of the authorized agents. 19 Consequently, the request for nullity will be rejected. 2. On the use of elements resulting from the response of the company SERGIC ENTREPRISES 20 The company notes that in the report notified on February 5, 2019, the rapporteur indicated that he had taken into account information that had been transmitted by its subsidiary, SERGIC ENTREPRISES, a legal entity distinct from SERGIC, in the context of a sanction procedure previously opened against the latter. The company SERGIC claims that neither the report nor the rapporteur's reply clearly indicate which information provided by the company SERGIC ENTREPRISES was relied upon by the rapporteur in the context of the present proceedings. The company thus indicates that it does not know how the rapporteur has taken these elements into account in the elaboration of his proposal. It therefore asks the restricted formation to rule solely on the basis of the observations and documents it has provided and to exclude the information provided by the company SERGIC ENTREPRISES. 21. The restricted formation notes first of all that, in his report of February 4, 2019, the rapporteur clearly stated that a first sanction procedure had been initiated against the company SERGIC ENTREPRISES but that the investigations carried out in the framework of this procedure had revealed that SERGIC ENTREPRISES was not the controller to whom failures could be blamed. The restricted formation notes that the sanction procedure initiated against SERGIC ENTREPRISES was closed on January 31, 2019. 22 The restricted formation then notes that, in his response to the company's observations, the rapporteur indicated that the elements that he had taken into account in drawing up his report were the information relating to the fact that SERGIC had notified the data breach to the data subjects, the fact that the number of persons concerned by the data breach had been clarified and the fact that the documents transmitted by the candidates were kept for pre-litigation and litigation purposes. 23 It considers that the indications given by the rapporteur enabled the company to identify unambiguously the information in question and the developments in the report containing it. 24 Finally, the restricted formation emphasizes that all the information on which the rapporteur based his proposal for sanction, whatever the source, was brought to the attention of the company SERGIC in the context of the procedure and submitted to a contradictory debate. In doing so, the company was aware that this information was taken into account and was in a position to question the accuracy of the facts developed in the report and to contest their scope. 25 Consequently, the company's request not to take into consideration the elements resulting from the procedure followed against SERGIC ENTREPRISES should be rejected. 3. On the absence of prior formal notice 26 The company argues that the breaches of which it is accused could have been corrected by means of a formal notice. It therefore believes that the immediate initiation of a sanction procedure, without prior formal notice, deprived it of the possibility of complying. 27 The Panel notes that it follows from the very letter of the provisions of III of Article 45 of the Act of January 6, 1978 as amended, resulting from Act no. 2018-493 of June 20, 2018 aimed at bringing national legislative provisions into conformity with those of the RGPD, that the pronouncement of a sanction is not subject to the prior adoption of a formal notice. The decision to appoint a rapporteur and to refer the matter to the restricted panel is a power belonging to the President of the CNIL, who has the power to initiate proceedings and can therefore determine, depending on the circumstances of the case, the follow-up to be given to investigations by, for example, closing a file, issuing a formal notice or referring the matter to the restricted panel with a view to issuing one or more corrective measures. 4. On the failure to comply with the obligation to ensure the security and confidentiality of personal data a. On the characterization of the breach 28 Article 32 (1) of the Regulation provides that: Having regard to the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risks, varying in probability and seriousness, to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including : pseudonymization and encryption of personal data ; means to guarantee the constant confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of the processing systems and services; means to restore the availability of and access to personal data within appropriate time frames in the event of a physical or technical incident; a procedure for regularly testing, analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of processing. 29 Article 32 (2) provides that: When assessing the appropriate level of security, particular account shall be taken of the risks represented by the processing, resulting in particular from the destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed accidentally or unlawfully. 30. It is the responsibility of the restricted formation to determine whether SERGIC has failed in its obligation to ensure the security of the personal data processed and, in particular, whether the company has implemented means to guarantee their confidentiality, in order to prevent their access by unauthorized third parties, in accordance with the aforementioned article 32 (1) ii. 31 The restricted training notes first of all that the existence of a security flaw on the www.sergic.com website is not disputed by the company. It notes that this security flaw made possible the violation of personal data insofar as it allowed unauthorized third parties to access this data. 32.restricted training reminds that when a request to access a resource is addressed to a server, the latter must first ensure that the issuer of this request is authorized to access the requested information. In this case, both the complainant and the delegation of control were able to freely consult the documents transmitted to the company by a large number of applicants for rental, without any measure restricting this possibility. This access to the documents kept by the company reflects a faulty design of the site, characterized in this case by the lack of implementation of a user authentication procedure. The data breach resulting from this security flaw could have been avoided if, for example, the company had implemented a means of authentication to ensure that the persons accessing the documents were indeed those who had downloaded them from the directory in question, and that only those persons could access them. The implementation of such a feature was an essential precautionary measure, which would have made it possible to guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data processed, in accordance with Article 32 (1) ii, and to significantly reduce the risk of this data breach occurring. 34. The restricted training recalls that the exposure of personal data without prior access control is identified as one of the most widespread vulnerabilities and that it has already pronounced numerous public pecuniary sanctions for similar facts. 35 In view of these elements, the restricted formation considers that the company has not implemented the appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the personal data processed, in accordance with Article 32 of the Regulation. b. On the scope of the breach 36 The company emphasizes that exploiting the vulnerability required special skills, as demonstrated by the use of a script by the delegation of control, and that it was only possible with knowledge of the URL https://www.crm.sergic.com/documents/upload/eresa/X.pdf . The company also points out that all of the documents contained in the directory could not have been downloaded by the delegated authority. It also points out that no user of the site has reported to it that his or her personal data has been misused. 37 The Company further emphasizes that each of the documents provided by the rental applicants is necessary for the constitution of the file, in particular to assess their solvency, and that it does not ask the applicants for any documents other than those referred to in Decree no. 2015-1437 of November 5, 2015 establishing the list of supporting documents that may be requested from the rental applicant and his deposit. 38 It further reminds that it has no control over the documents spontaneously uploaded by the candidates although they are not included in the aforementioned decree. Likewise, the company considers that it cannot be held responsible for the fact that some candidates download their Carte Vitale as proof of identity or that the registration number (NIR) appears on documents issued by social organizations that are transmitted by individuals. 39 Finally, the company explains that following the data breach, it planned to fix the vulnerability over several months, which resulted in the release of a patch on September 17, 2018 that will definitively end the vulnerability. The company specifies that these delays are explained by the strong demand for rentals during the summer period and by the difficulty of suspending its activities during this period. 40 Firstly, the restricted training observed that the exploitation of the vulnerability did not require any particular technical mastery of IT. Indeed, the simple modification of the value of X in the URL https://www.crm.sergic.com/documents/upload/eresa/X.pdf allowed anyone with knowledge of the above URL to download the documents in question, without the need to create an account on the site beforehand, and without requiring more complicated handling than the simple modification of the value X, which corresponds to a number. Moreover, the restricted training considers that the use of a script does not require advanced skills to exploit this vulnerability. The use of a script by the control delegation had the sole purpose of automating a manual process of changing the value of X at the end of the URL in question, in order to download one document after another more quickly. 41 Secondly, regarding the number of files concerned by the security flaw, the restricted formation observes that it is the CNIL delegation that has, on its own initiative, interrupted the execution of the script in order not to overload the server hosting the website. It then emerges from the information transmitted by the company to the delegation during the audit of September 13, 2018, and from the observations made, that all of the documents contained in the directory in question, i.e. 290,870 files, were made accessible by this security flaw. The files that, according to the company, could not be downloaded corresponded to numbers to which files were not attached as the company agreed at the hearing. The Panel notes that in its submissions, the Company further indicated that the number of persons involved was 29,440. 42 Third, the Panel believes that the breach of security is aggravated by the nature of the personal data made available. Indeed, as explained above, the documents transmitted by the candidates for rental are of a very diverse nature and included, in particular, marriage certificates, divorce judgments, employment contracts, documents relating to social benefits or tax notices. These documents contain both identification data, such as surname, first name and contact details, but also a large amount of information that can reveal some of the most intimate aspects of people's lives, such as divorce judgments. The limited training does not question the need for SERGIC to have most of these documents. It nevertheless recalls that Article 32 of the Regulation requires the data controller to implement security measures appropriate to the risks induced by the processing for the rights and freedoms of individuals, risks resulting in particular from unauthorized access to personal data processed. Moreover, insofar as SERGIC processes documents containing very precise information on certain aspects of the private life of individuals, the need to implement proportionate security measures, allowing to guarantee their confidentiality, was all the more important. The restricted training recalls on this point that recital 83 of the Regulation provides that \[...\] These measures should ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation in relation to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. 44 Finally, the restricted training notes that the existence of the vulnerability on www.sergic.com was brought to the Company's attention as early as March 8, 2018 and was not resolved until September 2018. The users' personal data was therefore accessible for at least six months even though the company SERGIC was aware of it. While the restricted training admits that the correction of the vulnerability could require analysis and technical development phases, it considers that emergency measures not aimed at correcting the vulnerability but at reducing the extent of the data breach were technically simple to implement and could have been rapidly deployed. For example, the files contained in the directory made accessible by the vulnerability could have been moved to a temporary directory or a URL filtering death could have been implemented to prevent access to the documents. Furthermore, it appears that the company, aware of the increase in its activities from May onwards, due to the high demand for rentals, chose to give priority to the stability of its information system during this period over the correction of the vulnerability of the personal data it contained. Consequently, insofar as the security flaw was brought to its attention as early as March 8, 2018, and insofar as the company knew that a peak in activity would occur as of May, it was incumbent upon it to anticipate this difficulty and to take all necessary measures as soon as it became aware of this vulnerability. 5. On the failure to comply with the obligation to retain data for a proportionate period of time 45 Section 5-1-e) of the Regulation provides that : 1. Personal data must be : (e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data are processed; personal data may be kept for longer periods insofar as they will be processed exclusively for archival purposes in the public interest, for scientific or historical research or for statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1), provided that the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation are implemented in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (limitation of storage) . 46 The rapporteur criticises SERGIC for keeping the documents transmitted by the applicants who did not access the rental for longer than the time necessary to achieve the purpose for which the personal data were collected and processed - namely the rental of a property - without this retention being subject to appropriate guarantees. 47 In defence, the company first of all points out that such persons may file a complaint with the Defender of Rights alleging discrimination and, in this respect, the Defender of Rights may require the company to forward the entire file submitted by the applicant. The company specifies that since the limitation period applicable to acts of discrimination is six years, the documents are kept for this period. It adds that the delegation of control has not noted the presence in the directory affected by the vulnerability of documents prior to 2012. The company emphasizes in its filings that no document in the file proves the absence of intermediate archiving of data and management of access authorizations to documents. 48 The restricted training reminds that the retention period of personal data must be determined according to the purpose of the processing. When this purpose is achieved, the data must either be deleted or be subject to intermediate archiving when their retention is necessary for compliance with legal obligations or for pre-litigation or litigation purposes. These data must then be placed in intermediate archiving, for a period not exceeding that necessary for the purposes for which they are kept, in accordance with the provisions in force. Thus, after sorting the relevant data to be archived, the data controller must provide, for this purpose, a dedicated archive database or a logical separation in the active database. This logical separation is ensured by the implementation of technical and organizational measures to ensure that only persons with an interest in processing the data because of their functions, such as persons in the legal department, have access to it. Beyond these retention periods for data in intermediate archives, personal data must be deleted. 49 In this case, the restricted training reminds that the collection by the company SERGIC of the personal data of the candidates has as a purpose the allocation of housing. As soon as this purpose is achieved, the personal data of candidates who have not accessed the rental can no longer be kept for more than three months, within the active database and beyond be the subject of a logical separation or even an intermediate archive. 50 However, the restricted training notes that the company indicated to the CNIL delegation during the control mission of September 13, 2018 that the documents transmitted by the candidates who did not have access to the lease, i.e. those for which the continuation of the processing was no longer justified, were not deleted and that no purge was implemented in the database. It also notes that, in its defense observations, the company produced a document from which it appears that its policy on the retention of customer and prospect data was not formalized until November 2018. Finally, during the meeting of April 11, 2019, the company indicated that the implementation of an archiving solution for the documents in question was in progress. 51 It appears from these various elements that the company SERGIC kept on an active basis the personal data of the candidates who did not access the rental for a period exceeding in significant proportions that necessary to achieve the purpose of the processing, namely the allocation of housing, without any intermediate archiving solution having been implemented. 52 With regard to all of these elements, the Restricted Training considers that a failure to comply with the obligation to retain data, as provided for in Article 5 of the Regulation, is characterized. III. on sanctions and publicity 53. Article 45-III 7° of the law of January 6, 1978 provides: Where the data controller or its processor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 referred to above or from the present law, the President of the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés may also, where appropriate after having sent him the warning provided for in I of the present article or, where appropriate in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted formation of the Commission with a view to the pronouncement, after an adversarial procedure, of one or more of the following measures: An administrative fine not exceeding EUR 10 million or, in the case of an undertaking, 2% of its total annual worldwide turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is the higher, with the exception of cases where the treatment is implemented by the State. In the cases referred to in Article 83(5) and (6) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased to 20 million euros and 4% of said revenue, respectively. In determining the amount of the fine, the restricted formation shall take into account the criteria specified in the same Article 83. Article 83 of the GDMP provides thatEach enforcement authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this Article for violations of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Depending on the specific features of each case, administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). In deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the amount of the administrative fine, due account shall be taken, in each individual case, of the following elements : a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them; b) whether the breach was committed intentionally or through negligence; c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects; (d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical and organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32; (e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or processor (i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the same purpose, compliance with those measures; (j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or certification schemes approved pursuant to Article 42; and (k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstances applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as the financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, as a result of the breach. 54 The Company considers that an administrative fine of 900,000 euros is disproportionate in light of the criteria set forth in Article 83 of the Regulations, its financial capacity and the sanctions previously imposed by the restricted formation. It then points out that neither the RGPD nor the French Data Protection Act provides for rules regarding the maximum amount of the fine that may be imposed by the supervisory authority when the breaches retained are punished, for one, by a fine of up to 10 million euros or 2% of annual worldwide turnover and, for the other, by a fine of up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual worldwide turnover. 55 Firstly, the Panel believes that in the present case, the aforementioned breaches justify the imposition of an administrative fine against the Company for the following reasons. 56 On the one hand, it recalls that, in view of the risks represented by personal data breaches, the European legislator intended to reinforce the obligations of data controllers with regard to the security of processing. Thus, according to recital 83 of the GDR, in order to guarantee security and prevent any processing carried out in breach of this Regulation, it is important that the controller or processor assess the risks inherent to the processing and implement measures to mitigate them, such as encryption. These measures should ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking into account the state of knowledge and the costs of implementation in relation to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. In assessing data security risks, account should be taken of the risks posed by the processing of personal data, such as the destruction, loss or alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, whether accidental or unlawful, that could lead to physical, material or moral damage. However, the restricted training observes that the security flaw that made possible the violation of data has its origin in a faulty design of its site by the company SERGIC. The implementation of an authentication procedure on the site was an elementary measure to be taken, which would have avoided the violation of personal data. 57 On the other hand, La formation restreinte notes that SERGIC did not take due diligence in correcting the vulnerability, whereas in the presence of a data breach, the RGPD imposes a rapid reaction. Recital 85 thus provides that a personal data breach may, if not dealt with in a timely and appropriate manner, cause physical, material or moral harm to the individuals concerned \[...\]. Even though no natural person has to date reported having suffered damage as a result of the data breach, the company's lack of promptness in correcting the vulnerability, for a period of at least six months, has had the effect of prolonging the risk of such damage occurring. 58. Next, the seriousness of the breaches must also be assessed with regard to the categories of data concerned. In this respect, the restricted training recalls that the data processed by the company in the context of managing the files of prospective tenants contain particularly precise information on certain aspects of their private life. Once it receives this type of data, the company must pay particular attention to the preservation of its confidentiality and to the methods of storage; however, it has not provided for an intermediate database and has kept this data for a clearly excessive length of time. 59 The restricted panel also recalls that § 3 of Article 83 of the Regulation provides that in the event of multiple violations, the total amount of the fine may not exceed the amount set for the most serious violation. In this case, insofar as the company is accused of a breach of Article 5 of the Regulation, which may be subject to a fine of up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual worldwide turnover, it is this maximum amount that should be taken into consideration. 60 In light of all of these elements, the restricted formation, taking into account the criteria set forth in article 83 of the GDR and the company's financial situation, believes that an administrative fine of 400,000 euros is justified and proportionate, as well as an additional penalty for advertising for the same reasons. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides : to reject the request for nullity raised by the company SERGIC; to reject the request of the company SERGIC not to take into consideration the elements resulting from the procedure followed against the company SERGIC ENTREPRISES ; to pronounce an administrative fine of 400,000 (four hundred thousand) euros against the company SERGIC; to make public, on the site of the CNIL and on the site of Légifrance, its deliberations which will be anonymized at the end of a period of two years from its publication. The President Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be appealed before the Council of State within two months of its notification."

Facts and procedure FUTURA INTERNATIONALE (hereafter referred to as the Company) is a simplified joint stock company with a single shareholder, whose registered office is located at 1 avenue des Violettes, in Bonneuil-sur-Marne (94380). Its activity is the installation of insulation equipment, heat pumps and windows. In 2017, the company had a turnover of 27,647,300 euros and a net profit of more than 500,000 euros. The turnover was EUR \[...\] with a net result of approximately EUR \[...\] in 2018. In March 2018 it had about 75 employees. On 6 February 2018, Ms \[...\] lodged a complaint with the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (hereinafter CNIL or the Commission) alleging telephone canvassing by the company FUTURA INTERNATIONALE. The complainant also stated that, despite opposition to the canvassing expressed orally to the telephone operators and by letter addressed to the company's headquarters, calls had not stopped several months after these approaches. On 20 March 2018, pursuant to Decision No. 2018-060C of the President, a CNIL delegation carried out an inspection mission to the premises of the company FUTURA INTERNATIONALE. The purpose of this mission was to verify the compliance of all processing operations relating to commercial prospecting carried out by or on behalf of the company with the provisions of the amended Act of 6 January 1978 and, more specifically, to investigate the complaint of Mrs \[...\]. During this audit, the delegation was informed that, in the course of its business, the company processes customer and prospect data obtained either directly from the persons concerned (whether they contact the company on their own initiative or are contacted as part of telephone canvassing operations by service providers using their own directories) or collected from third parties as part of a sponsorship programme. The delegation was informed that the company's commercial telephone canvassing was carried out by several call centres acting as subcontractors, most of which are located in North Africa. The company indicated to these subcontractors the department it wished to target, and the call centre operators would call the persons concerned to offer the company's services. If people expressed an interest, they were either put directly in contact with an employee of FUTURA INTERNATIONALE or called back later to check the eligibility criteria for energy saving certificates, a device better known as the one-euro insulation. People could also be contacted in this way when they had been sponsored by customers of the company who had given their contact details. The delegation was informed that the company had not set up a centralised mechanism to take into account requests for objection expressed by those approached. The delegation took copies of 19 e-mails sent to the company by individuals expressing their refusal to participate in future prospecting operations. The delegation was informed that customer data were processed in the Progibos customer management software, in which telesales agents could record comments on customers for the employees of FUTURA INTERNATIONALE. The delegation noted, among these comments, remarks relating to the state of health of the persons contacted and insulting remarks against them. Having obtained copies of recordings of conversations between teleoperators and prospects, the delegation noted that, in a significant number of conversations, the persons were not informed of the recording of the call. When individuals were notified of the recording, no further information on the protection of personal data was provided. Furthermore, following the audit, the Commission services requested the company to provide several documents necessary for the performance of their task, in order to assess the company's liability. These documents included the contracts concluded with the call centres. The company was given eight days to submit these documents. At the company's request, two extensions were granted, until 11 April and then until 20 April 2018. The company sent certain documents on 11, 17, 19 and 20 April, without all the requested documents being provided, despite two reminders from the Commission services on 23 April and 4 June 2018, one of which was sent by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt. In the light of these facts, the President notified the company of Decision No MED-2018-039 of 27 September 2018 giving it formal notice, within two months, to take the following measures: ensure the adequacy, relevance and non-excessiveness of the data collected, in accordance with Article 5(1)(c) of the general data protection regulation No 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 , in particular by : deleting comments which are inappropriate and excessive in relation to the purpose of the processing operation ; taking the necessary measures to prevent excessive comments from being recorded in the PROGIBOS software, for example by setting up a system for automatically detecting words that are inappropriate, irrelevant and excessive in relation to the purpose of the processing operation, in order to exclude them from the comment fields, and by making staff aware of the need to record only adequate, relevant and non-excessive data; justifying the reasons why partial replies were sent to the Commission's email of 23 April 2018 and letter of 4 June 2018 and communicating them to the Commission: the exhaustive list of call centres working on behalf of the company ; for each of the call centres, the fifty most recent records relating to prospecting telephone calls made on behalf of the company; the one hundred most recent recordings available to the Company of telephone conversations between prospects and Company employees; inform the persons from whom personal data are collected directly, under the conditions now provided for in Articles 12 and 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation No 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 , in particular by providing, at the time the personal data are collected, information on the identity of the controller, the purpose of the processing, the rights of individuals and the transfer of data to a non-EU Member State, and by providing, on the www.futura-internationale.fr , information on data transfers to a non-EU Member State and on the storage periods of the categories of data processed or the criteria used to determine those periods; provide information to persons from whom personal data are collected indirectly, under the conditions now laid down in Article 14 of the general data protection regulation No 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 , in particular by providing godchildren, at the latest at the time of the first communication with them, with information on the identity of the controller, the purpose of the processing, the rights of individuals and the transfer of data to a non-EU Member State, and by providing a full information notice on the website www.futura-internationale.fr ; define and implement an effective procedure for the right of objection in order to comply with the provisions of Article 21(2) of the general data protection regulation No 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 and, in particular, grant the request made by Ms \[...\] ; no longer transfer personal data to a State which does not ensure an adequate level of protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms, unless one of the conditions laid down in Articles 46 to 49 of the general data protection regulation No 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 is fulfilled; justify to the CNIL that all of the aforementioned requests have been complied with within the time limit set. The formal notice was received by the company on October 2, 2018. On November 29, 2018, the President of the CNIL received a request for an extension of the deadline set by the formal notice. In this letter, a lawyer representing the company explained that she had been appointed as data protection delegate at the CNIL, without having been informed of this, and that the company was late in receiving this formal notice. As a result, the company's board requested that the two-month period initially granted be doubled, which request was granted on 13 December 2018. On 15 February 2019, the company's board sent a letter to the president of the CNIL, informing her that, despite several reminders from her, it had been unable to obtain the supporting evidence requested from the company. Consequently, he could not justify the compliance of FUTURA INTERNATIONALE but nevertheless communicated some documents provided by the company. In order to examine these elements, the President of the Commission appointed Mrs. Sophie LAMBREMON as rapporteur on April 29, 2019, on the basis of article 47 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended in its version applicable on the date of appointment. At the end of his investigation, on 11 June 2019, the rapporteur sent a report by bearer to FUTURA INTERNATIONALE detailing the breaches of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on data protection (hereinafter the Regulation or the DPMR) which he considered to have occurred in this case. The report proposed that the restricted panel of the Commission issue an injunction to bring the processing into conformity with the provisions of Articles 5(1)(c), 12, 13, 14, 21 and 44 of the Regulation, together with a penalty payment of five hundred euros per day of delay at the end of a period of fifteen days following notification of the restricted panel's decision, and an administrative fine of five hundred thousand euros. It also proposed that this decision be made public but that it should no longer allow the company to be identified by name after a period of two years from its publication. The report also included a notice convening the meeting of the restricted session of 19 September 2019, giving the company one month to submit its written comments. On July 10, 2019, the Company, through its new Board, filed comments. The rapporteur replied on 25 July. On 31 July, the company submitted further comments in response to the rapporteur's comments. At the session of the restricted formation on 19 September 2019, the rapporteur maintained the proposals made in his sanction report with the exception of the injunction relating to the adequacy of free comments, as the company complied on this point. II Reasons for the decision 1 On the applicable law The restricted training notes that the control carried out by the Commission services took place on 20 March 2018. This date is prior to the entry into force of the RGPD. For this reason, the letter of formal notice of 27 September 2018, although notified after the entry into force of the text, is indicative of breaches of Law No 78-17 of 6 January 1978 as amended, while calling for compliance with the Regulation, which is now applicable. The Panel considers that the principle of non-retroactivity of criminal sanctions in principle prohibits the application of the Regulation to punish instantaneous breaches that occurred before its entry into force. It nevertheless notes that the breaches noted in the letter of formal notice are continuous breaches, which are defined by an action (or an omission) extending over a certain period of time, within the meaning of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights (European Court of Human Rights, Grand Chamber, case of Rohlena v. the Czech Republic, req. 59552/08, paragraph 28). The restricted panel considers that these failures continued at least until the notification of the sanction report, i.e. after the entry into force of the RGPD, because the company failed to demonstrate compliance. The restricted formation points out that, in the event of continuing breaches, account must be taken of the law applicable at the time of the last state of the breach (EC 9/10, 5 November 2014, UBS France SA, No 371585, point 24). Consequently, the panel considers that the RGPD is applicable to the facts of the case and that the infringements must therefore be assessed in the light of that text. (2) Failure to comply with the obligation to process adequate and relevant data limited to that which is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. Article 5(1)(c) of the GDMP provides that personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. The restricted training notes that abusive terms relating to the state of health of individuals have been found in the Progibos software for the management of the company's clients. It considers that, by their very nature, the offensive comments are inappropriate in relation to the purpose for which the data are processed and that there is no justification, in this case, for the presence of data relating to the health of individuals in the software for managing clients and prospects. It notes in this regard that the excessive nature of those data is not called into question by the company. The restricted formation also notes that the company has not demonstrated that it had deleted the excessive or inadequate comments by the expiry of the period granted in the notice and that, consequently, the failure to comply with the obligation to process only adequate, relevant data limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed was constituted at that date. The Panel therefore considers, in the light of these elements, that a failure to comply with Article 5(1)(c) of the RGPD was constituted at the end of the period laid down in the letter of formal notice. The Panel notes that the company provides evidence that it purged the excessive comments during the sanction proceedings. The Panel also takes note of the observations made by the rapporteur at the sitting of 19 September 2019. The rapporteur considers that the company has demonstrated its compliance and that, therefore, there is no longer any need to issue an injunction on this point. However, the restricted formation notes that, although information is actually delivered by means of a contextual banner to users of the Progibos software, the bailiff's report drawn up on 30 July 2019 does not show that the company has put in place a computerised mechanism preventing the recording in the software of offensive terms or terms relating to the state of health of persons. This is also not apparent from the documents provided by the company during the sanction procedure, nor from the statements made by its board during the meeting of 19 September 2019. However, in view of the observations made by the supervisory delegation on 20 March 2018 regarding the nature of the comments entered by users of the Progibos software, the restricted formation considers that a mere mention of information intended for users cannot suffice, in the case in point, to ensure compliance with the provisions of Article 5(1)(c) of the RGPD. On the contrary, it considers that the data controller must set up a binding system enabling it to ensure that the behaviour observed is not repeated, either by automatically preventing the recording of certain terms as soon as they are entered, or by carrying out an automated daily review of the comments recorded. These elements are therefore not such as to call into question the characterisation of the breach referred to at the end of the investigation. 3) Failure to inform individuals of the obligation to provide information The first paragraph of Article 12 of the PGRD provides that the controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 \[...\] regarding the processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible manner in clear and simple terms, in particular any information specifically intended for a child. Information shall be provided in writing or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means. Where the data subject so requests, the information may be provided orally, provided that the identity of the data subject is proved by other means . As regards information to persons whose personal data are collected directly from them by the company, Article 13 of the RGPD provides : 1. Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from that person, the controller shall provide him/her, at the time when the data in question are obtained, with all the following information : (a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where appropriate, of the representative of the controller ; (b) where applicable, the contact details of the Data Protection Officer ; (c) the purposes of the processing operation for which the personal data are intended and the legal basis of the processing operation ; (d) where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party ; (e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any; and (f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a third country or to an international organisation, and the existence or absence of a decision on adequacy issued by the Commission or, in the case of transfers as referred to in Articles 46 or 47 or in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the reference to appropriate or adequate safeguards and the means of obtaining a copy of them or the place where they have been made available ; 2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the data subject, at the time when the personal data are obtained, with the following additional information which is necessary to guarantee fair and transparent processing : (a) the period for which personal data are stored or, where that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period ; (b) the existence of the right to request access, rectification or erasure of personal data from the controller, or a restriction on the processing in respect of the data subject, or the right to object to the processing and the right to data portability ; (c) where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without prejudice to the lawfulness of the processing operation based on the consent given prior to its withdrawal ; (d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority ; (e) information as to whether the requirement to supply personal data is regulatory or contractual in nature or whether it is a condition for entering into a contract and whether the data subject is under an obligation to supply the personal data, as well as the possible consequences of failure to supply such data ; (f) the existence of automated decision making, including profiling, as referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in such cases, relevant information as to the underlying logic, as well as the importance and the intended consequences of such processing for the data subject. As regards the information to be provided where the personal data have not been obtained from the data subjects, Article 14 provides : 1. Where the personal data have not been obtained from the data subject, the controller shall provide the data subject with all the following information: (a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where appropriate, of the representative of the controller ; (b) where applicable, the contact details of the Data Protection Officer ; (c) the purposes of the processing operation for which the personal data are intended and the legal basis of the processing operation ; (d) the categories of personal data concerned ; (e) where applicable, the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data; (f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to carry out a transfer of personal data to a recipient in a third country or an international organisation, and the existence or absence of a decision on adequacy issued by the Commission or, in the case of transfers as referred to in Articles 46 or 47 or in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the reference to appropriate or adequate safeguards and the means of obtaining a copy thereof or the place where it was made available ; 2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the data subject with the following information necessary to guarantee fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject : (a) the period for which personal data will be kept or, where that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period ; (b) where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party ; (c) the existence of the right to request access, rectification or erasure of personal data from the controller, or a restriction on the processing in respect of the data subject, as well as the right to object to the processing and the right to data portability ; (d) where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without prejudice to the lawfulness of the processing operation based on consent prior to its withdrawal ; (e) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority ; (f) the source from which the personal data originate and, where appropriate, an indication as to whether or not they originate from publicly available sources ; (g) the existence of automated decision making, including profiling, as referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in such cases, relevant information as to the underlying logic, as well as the importance and the intended consequences of such processing for the data subject. 3. 3. The controller shall provide the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2: (a) within a reasonable time after having obtained the personal data, but not exceeding one month, having regard to the specific circumstances in which the personal data are processed ; (b) if the personal data are to be used for the purpose of communicating with the data subject, no later than the time of the first communication to the data subject; or (c) if it is intended to communicate the information to another recipient, no later than when the personal data are first communicated. Guidelines on transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 were adopted by the Article 29 Working Party on 29 November 2017 (revised version adopted on 11 April 2018, WP260 rev.01). They specify, on page 22, that while multi-level information is possible for the sake of clarity, the G29 recommends that the first level \[...\] should include details of the purpose of the processing, the identity of the controller and a description of the rights of the data subjects, before recommending that this information should be brought directly to the attention of the data subject at the time of collection of the personal data. The restricted training notes that it appears from the telephone recordings provided by the company that the persons who are the subject of telephone canvassing are either not provided with any information regarding the recording of the call or are simply informed about the recording of the conversation without any further information about the processing of their personal data, such as the purpose of the processing, the identity of the controller or the rights they have. The restricted formation points out that the company does not claim or demonstrate that it has put in place, within the period granted by the formal notice, an information mechanism in compliance with the abovementioned provisions, as no details were provided on this point in the summary response to the formal notice of 15 February 2019. The same applies to the information provided to sponsored persons whose personal data are indirectly collected. The Panel therefore considers that, in the light of these elements, a breach of Articles 12, 13 and 14 of the RGPD was constituted at the expiry of the deadline set by the letter of formal notice. The restricted formation takes note of the fact that the company states that it will henceforth communicate complete information in the form of an e-mail to any person who is the subject of telephone canvassing, as well as to persons whose data are not collected directly. However, the restricted training notes that, although the company states that it makes complete information available to persons who are the subject of telephone canvassing and those whose data are collected indirectly, it has not justified the information it provides, for example by producing a model of the e-mail sent. Furthermore, with regard to persons whose data are collected directly, the restricted training notes that the company indicates that it provides information in the form of an e-mail sent after the telephone exchange. The restricted training recalls that Article 13 of the GDMP requires that information be provided at the time of collection of personal data. Indeed, in the light of this text, it is necessary that the individual be put in a position to be informed of the information relating to the processing of his personal data at the time when his data are collected, and not only subsequently. Thus, information, even summary information, must be communicated to him through the voice service or the teleoperator, offering him the possibility of obtaining complete information either by pressing a key on his telephone keypad or by sending an e-mail, for example. These elements are therefore not such as to call into question the characterisation of the breach referred to at the close of the investigation. 4. on the failure to respect the right of opposition The second paragraph of Article 21 of the EPR provides that where personal data are processed for the purpose of canvassing, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data relating to him for such purposes, including profiling insofar as it relates to such canvassing . Moreover, Article 12(2) of the abovementioned GDMP provides that the controller shall facilitate the exercise of the rights conferred on the data subject under Articles 15 to 22. The restricted formation therefore considers, under these two articles combined, that it was up to the company to put in place a mechanism allowing effective consideration of the right of objection expressed by persons subject to telephone canvassing. In this respect, it had to be able to ensure that the opposition expressed by the persons concerned was respected and that the persons who had expressed their opposition no longer received canvassing calls from its subcontractors. The restricted formation notes that it appears from the statements of the company's employees, collected during the audit carried out on 20 March 2018, that no procedure had been put in place to ensure that the opposition expressed to the company was communicated to its subcontractors or that the opposition expressed directly to the call centre operators was centralised at the company's head office and passed on to the company and all subcontractors. Consequently, it appears that the opposition expressed by the persons canvassed was in vain: when it was expressed to the company's head office, the subcontractors were not informed and continued the canvassing operations; when it was expressed directly to a subcontractor, neither the head office nor the thirty-five other call centres then working for the company were informed, and the canvassing continued despite the refusal expressed by the persons. It is clear from the above that, whatever the means of expressing opposition, it remained ineffective. The Panel also considers that the failure to take account of the opposition expressed is apparent from the complaint of Mrs \[...\], who reports a very large number of calls received after having expressed her opposition. This fact is also apparent from the e-mails received by the partnership that no longer wished to be the target of telephone canvassing, the majority of these e-mails reporting several calls received despite the expressed refusal. The Panel notes that the company sent to the Commission services, after the monitoring carried out on 20 March 2018, three certificates from call centres stating that they had received a list of persons who no longer wished to be canvassed from the company. The limited training notes that only three certificates were provided, even though the company indicated that it was working at that time with 36 call centres. It therefore takes the view, in view of the company's obligation vis-à-vis these three call centres, that no steps were taken to ensure that the objection was actually complied with by all its subcontractors. In addition, the restricted formation notes that the information contained in the certificates, which the company claims to have provided to the call centres, does not allow sufficient identification of the persons who expressed their refusal to be canvassed by telephone. On the one hand, the absence of any mention of the telephone number prevents the registration of the person on a list opposing telephone canvassing. On the other hand, the mere mention of the person's e-mail address and surname (a fortiori when the latter is particularly widespread) creates a risk of confusion in the event of homonymy. Thus, the subcontractors were not put in a position to ensure that the persons concerned would no longer be contacted by them. Lastly, the restricted formation considers that the evidence produced by the company does not show that, at the end of the period allowed in the formal notice, the company ensured that the opposition expressed by a person canvassed by the teleoperator of a subcontracted call centre was communicated for the purpose of being centralised and then forwarded to all subcontractors. The restricted formation considers that, in the absence of such a mechanism, any opposition expressed during a telephone canvassing call will not lead to the cessation of any canvassing operation on behalf of the company, in particular by another call centre. The Panel therefore considers, in the light of these elements, that a failure to comply with Article 21 of the RGPD was constituted at the expiry of the time limit set by the formal notice. The panel notes the company's statements, both during the written exchanges with the rapporteur and at the sitting of 19 September 2019, that it has set up a regularly updated opposition list in the Progibos software. However, the restricted formation considers that this mechanism is insufficient to impose its respect by the call centres and, consequently, the effective taking into account of people's opposition. Indeed, the restricted formation notes that this exclusion list takes the form of a simple table, to which an information banner in the software inviting call centre teleoperators to consult the table refers. Nothing is put in place to automate the process and ensure its reliability, for example by providing that each number called by a teleoperator is automatically and beforehand compared with this do not call list to prevent the call. With regard firstly to the economic interests represented by commercial prospecting, both for FUTURA INTERNATIONALE and its subcontractors, secondly to the volume of calls made on behalf of the company and thirdly to the number of data subjects (more than 300 people had already expressed their opposition on the day of the meeting), the restricted formation considers that only an automated mechanism is sufficiently effective to ensure that the opposition expressed by the data subjects is respected. Furthermore, the restricted panel notes that this list contains data relating to the postal address of the individuals. These data are personal data and are not necessary for the specific purpose of this processing operation, which is to constitute an objection list to telephone canvassing. Indeed, surnames, first names and telephone numbers are sufficient to ensure compliance with this obligation, unless it can be demonstrated that the list also makes it possible to demonstrate opposition to postal canvassing. Finally, the restricted formation observes that the company does not show that the data of the persons having expressed their opposition to the processing have indeed been purged from the Progibos software, the judicial officer's statement of facts issued on 30 July 2019 being silent on this point. This element is thus not likely to call into question the characterization of the failure evoked at the end of the investigation. 5 On the failure to cooperate with the supervisory authority Article 31 of the GDMP provides that the controller and the processor and, where appropriate, their representatives shall cooperate with the supervisory authority, at the latter's request, in the performance of its tasks. The restricted training notes the numerous requests made by the Commission services after the supervision of 20 March 2018 for communication of the documents necessary for the performance of their tasks, as well as the very partial replies from FUTURA INTERNATIONALE, which provided only a very small proportion of the information requested. It also notes that the Commission has systematically granted the company's requests for extensions of time limits, without this allowing the documents requested to be provided. The Panel also notes that the company did not reply satisfactorily to the formal notice notified to it since the reply was not accompanied by the supporting evidence requested in the context of this procedure and did not cover all the shortcomings identified. Again, the restricted formation notes that the company requested and obtained a maximum extension of the deadline granted by the formal notice. The company states that it was poorly advised, but the restricted panel notes, on the one hand, that, as controller, it was the sole responsibility of the company to respond to the requests addressed to it and to report on compliance with the DMPR, it being responsible for choosing the competent professionals to whom it intended to entrust the defence of its interests, if necessary. It was up to the company to call on new interlocutors if it considered that it was confronted with the incompetence of the first seizures. Furthermore, the Panel notes that the failure relating to the lack of cooperation with the Commission's services, which it considers to be characteristic of this case, cannot stem from a simple ignorance of the rules on data protection that the company puts forward to explain the difficulty it had in responding to the CNIL's requests. It considers that the lack of response to the requests made by the CNIL and to the formal notice sent by the President of the Commission, as well as the failure to take those requests into account prior to the notification of a penalty report, are sufficient to demonstrate, if not the clearly expressed desire not to respond to the CNIL's requests, at the very least a flagrant lack of interest in those matters. The Panel notes that this failure ended with the notification of the sanction report, which was the only point at which an exchange of views with the company, through its board, could take place. Finally, the company wrongly considers that the characterisation of this failure is incompatible with the possibility given to the company to comply by means of a formal notice and to make comments during the exchanges with the rapporteur in the context of the sanction procedure. The principle of cooperation laid down by Article 31 of the RGPD pre-exists the procedure initiated: its non-compliance is constituted as such and is not linked to the company's subsequent compliance or to the principle of adversarial proceedings which governs the sanction procedure. The Panel therefore considers, in the light of these elements, that a failure to comply with Article 31 of the RGPD was constituted at the end of the period prescribed by the formal notice. The restricted panel takes note of the reality of the cooperation between the company and the rapporteur. It takes account of the controller's efforts to bring it into line where these are demonstrated, but the decision it delivers is also intended to punish past conduct. This element is therefore not such as to call into question the characterisation of the breach referred to at the end of the period of notice. 6) Failure to comply with the obligation to regulate transfers of personal data outside the European Union Article 44 of the GDMP provides: a transfer to a third country or to an international organisation of personal data which are or are intended to be processed further to such transfer may take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in this Chapter are complied with by the controller and the processor, including as regards further transfers of personal data from the third country or international organisation to another third country or international organisation. All the provisions of this Chapter shall be applied in such a way that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by this Regulation is not compromised . The restricted formation notes that the company was, on the day of the check, transferring data to States considered not to provide an adequate level of protection in accordance with Article 45 of the GDR (Côte d'Ivoire, Morocco, Tunisia) through its Progibos software. In view of the lack of adequacy, the restricted formation notes that it was up to the company FUTURA INTERNATIONALE to provide appropriate guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of Article 46 of the RGPD. Concerning the situation on the day of the control carried out and subsequently emerging from the elements communicated by the board of the company in response to the formal notice, the data controller chose to frame the transfer of personal data to its processors located outside the territory of the European Union by contractual clauses. However, the restricted formation notes that these clauses do not meet the requirements of Articles 44 et seq. of the GDMP since they were not adopted by the European Commission or by a supervisory authority, contrary to the requirements of Article 46 of the GDMP. The restricted formation takes note of the new clauses on the protection of personal data that the company's board communicated to the rapporteur in the context of the sanction procedure and notes that these clauses take over the European Commission's standard contractual clauses. Nevertheless, the restricted formation notes, on the one hand, that, on the day of the closure of the investigation, the contracts communicated to it are not final documents, since certain clauses are not entirely drafted, in particular the clauses relating to the remuneration of the service provider. Secondly, and despite the rapporteur's requests on this very point during the procedure, the restricted formation observes that, on the day the investigation was closed, the company had not communicated a version of those contracts signed by both parties. The panel finds that a cursory examination of the contract between FUTURA INTERNATIONALE and its subcontractor \[...\] reveals that the company's stamp and the signature of its representative do not appear on the contract itself but only on the printout of the photograph of the contract, since the stamp extends beyond the photograph and cannot therefore appear on the original document. Consequently, that document does not enable the restricted formation to ascertain the company's compliance on that point. Furthermore, the restricted formation notes that the contract and the annex binding FUTURA INTERNATIONALE and its subcontractor \[...\] is not signed by both parties. Finally, the European Commission's standard contractual clauses provide that these clauses are subject to the law of the Member State where the personal data exporter is established, in this case France. However, the Restricted Training notes that, in the contracts provided by the company, the clauses are systematically subject to the law of the State where the sub-contractor is established. The Panel therefore considers that, in the light of the foregoing, there was a breach of Article 44 of the GDR at the end of the period prescribed by the formal notice. The restricted formation takes note of the communication to the rapporteur of contracts concluded between the company and its subcontractors. It notes, however, that the company has not justified the establishment, in its relations with its subcontractors, of a legal framework complying with the provisions of Articles 44 to 50 of the Regulation, and in particular the fact that it has co-signed with them amendments to the contracts corresponding to the standard contractual clauses on the protection of personal data adopted by the European Commission. Indeed, the restricted formation notes that the contracts communicated on 31 July 2019 are incomplete, and that the documents photographed are not signed by the two co-contractors, only the photograph being stamped and signed by the company FUTURA INTERNATIONALE. Moreover, a contract remains unsigned by all the contracting parties. This element is thus not likely to call into question the characterization of the breach mentioned at the end of the investigation. III. on corrective measures and their publicity Under the terms of III of Article 20 of the Act of 6 January 1978 as amended : Where the data controller or its processor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or this Act, the President of the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés may also, where appropriate after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, where appropriate in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted formation of the Commission with a view to the pronouncement, after an adversarial procedure, of one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 2° An injunction to bring the processing into conformity with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or from this Law or to comply with the requests made by the data subject to exercise his rights, which may be accompanied, except in cases where the processing is implemented by the State, by a penalty payment of not more than €100,000 per day of delay from the date set by the restricted formation; \[...\]. 7° With the exception of cases where the treatment is implemented by the State, an administrative fine may not exceed EUR 10 million or, in the case of an undertaking, 2% of the total annual worldwide turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is the higher. In the cases referred to in Article 83(5) and (6) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, these ceilings are increased to EUR 20 million and 4 % of that turnover, respectively. In determining the amount of the fine, the restricted formation shall take into account the criteria set out in Article 83 of Regulation (EU) No 2016/679. Article 83 of the RGPD provides for : 1. Each enforcement authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 2. 2. Depending on the specific features of each case, administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). In deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the amount of the administrative fine, due account shall be taken, in each individual case, of the following elements : (a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them ; (b) whether the breach was committed intentionally or through negligence or misconduct ; (c) any measures taken by the controller or the processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects ; (d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or the processor, taking into account the technical and organisational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32; (e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or the processor; (f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach and mitigating its possible negative effects ; (g) the categories of personal data concerned by the breach ; (h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether and to what extent the controller or the processor notified the breach ; (i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the same purpose, compliance with those measures ; (j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or certification schemes approved pursuant to Article 42; and (k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstances applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as the financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, as a result of the breach. Firstly, with regard to the fine proposed by the rapporteur, the small group considers that, in the case in point, the abovementioned breaches justify the imposition of an administrative fine on the company for the following reasons: The Panel finds that the breaches of Articles 5(1)(c), 12, 13, 14, 21 and 44 of the Regulation have persisted beyond the time limit set by the President of the Commission's formal notice and that it was only when the penalty report was notified that the company took steps to comply, more than eight months after the formal notice was notified. The company thus did not fully cooperate with the Commission services until the initiation of the sanction procedure and did not demonstrate compliance by the expiry of the deadline. It also notes that most of the failures relate to obligations which Law No 78-17 of 6 January 1978 as amended already imposed on data controllers and which did not arise from the RGPD. It therefore considers that the argument that the company derives from the difficulty it has had in applying a new legal framework in a short space of time is not valid. It also notes that some of these shortcomings relate to the rights of individuals (right to information and right to object), which were not respected by the company. As of the closing date of the investigation, there was no evidence that the company and its sub-contractors had complied with these requirements. However, the restricted formation considers that the non-respect of their rights affects the persons concerned, particularly with regard to the right of opposition, which is demonstrated by the tone of the e-mails sent by the prospects to the company. Consequently, in view of the consequences for individuals, such breaches should be severely punished. The restricted training also reminds that the obligation to regulate the transfer of personal data outside the territory of the European Union is the consequence of the non-existence, on the territory of many states, of protective regulations relating to personal data. Failure by the data controller to comply with this obligation runs the risk of having such data processed outside any protective legal framework, to the detriment of the rights of the data subjects. The restricted training therefore considers that it must pay particular attention to the compliance of data controllers with this obligation. All these reasons justify the imposition of an administrative fine. Secondly, as regards the amount of this fine, the company argues that it is disproportionate in view of the good will of the company, which had no intention of contravening the GDMP and was merely ill-informed. On this point, on the contrary, the restricted formation points to a lack of cooperation which is perfectly characteristic of the case. The Panel considers that, far from being a factor which should lead it to reduce the amount of the fine imposed, the conduct of the company up to the notification of the penalty report should, on the contrary, be taken into account in order to increase the penalty imposed, as required by Article 83(2)(b) of the RGPD. The company then considers that the amount of the fine is disproportionate in relation to the undertaking's turnover, since the rapporteur did not take useful account of the reduction in turnover that occurred in 2018 and was announced for 2019. In this regard, the restricted formation considers that the amount of the fine proposed by the rapporteur is measured against the accounting information provided by the company, which shows a turnover of approximately EUR 27 million in 2017 and EUR 20 million in 2018. The Commission notes that, in view of the infringements in question, Article 83(5)(b) of the ECMR sets the amount of the fine at EUR 20 million, and that the amount of the fine proposed corresponds to 2,5 % of the company's annual turnover, which is not excessive in view of the company's conduct, in particular prior to the notification of the penalty report, and in view of the seriousness of the infringements, in particular the infringement of the rights of individuals. Finally, if the company demonstrates that its turnover decreased in 2018, this result remains of the same order of magnitude as the result for 2017 despite a decrease in net income, and does not justify a reduction in the amount of the fine imposed, which is not directly correlated to the company's financial results, even if the latter are taken into account in its calculation. The restricted formation underlines the plurality of the infringements in question and their persistence and gravity. It takes particular account of the consequences for the persons concerned and notes that this case originated in a complaint lodged by an individual with the Commission. It also notes the company's reluctance to take account of the applicable legislation on the protection of personal data and its lack of diligence in remedying the breaches observed, despite numerous reminders from the Commission services. However, the restricted training also takes into account the steps taken by the company during the sanction procedure to achieve partial compliance, the fact that it is an SME and the evolution of its financial situation, in order to determine the amount of a fair and proportionate administrative fine, recalling that the fine must nevertheless be dissuasive. Thirdly, as regards the need to issue an injunction, the company considers that it has brought its practices into line with the requirements of the RGPD. It considers that this progress is demonstrated by its responses to the sanction report and then to the rapporteur's comments and that, therefore, an injunction is not necessary as compliance has already been achieved. As explained above, the Panel considers that the company has not demonstrated, at the closing date of the investigation, the compliance of its treatment with Articles 5(1)(c), 12, 13, 14, 21 and 44 of the RGPD. If the company has not complied with these failures, the proposed injunction should be issued. Fourthly, regarding the publicity of its decision, the company states that such publicity would have dramatic consequences for the privacy of persons whose personal data are processed by the company, since it would make it a target of computer attacks. On this point, the restricted training notes that the publicity has no impact on the security of personal data since its decision does not reveal any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious persons. In view of the company's statements as to its position in its field of intervention, as it claims to be a major player in its sector, the restricted formation considers that the publicity of the sanction is justified in view of the importance of the problem of commercial prospecting, both in relation to its scale and its practical consequences for the persons canvassed. In addition, it meets a legitimate expectation of persons who have been or may in the future be the subject of commercial canvassing by telephone by the company or other actors and will alert them to their rights. It follows from all of the above and taking into account the criteria laid down in Article 83 of the RGPD that an administrative fine of EUR 500 000, an injunction accompanied by a periodic penalty payment and an additional publication penalty for a period of two years are justified and proportionate. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after deliberation, decides to : issue an injunction against the company FUTURA INTERNATIONALE to bring the processing into compliance with the obligations resulting from Articles 5 paragraph 1 point c), 12, 13, 14, 21 and 44 of Regulation No. 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on data protection, and in particular : - take measures to effectively prevent excessive comments from being recorded in the PROGIBOS software, for example by setting up a system for automatically detecting words which are inappropriate, irrelevant and excessive in relation to the purpose of the processing operation, in order to exclude them from the comment fields or prevent them from being entered ; - inform the persons from whom personal data are collected directly and indirectly, under the conditions provided for in Articles 12, 13 and 14 of the general data protection regulation No 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, for example by directly informing the data subject, by means of the voice service or the teleoperator, of the existence and purpose of the device and of his right to object, and by offering him the possibility of obtaining full information either by pressing a key on his telephone keypad or by sending an e-mail ; - to implement a procedure to ensure the effectiveness of the rights of opposition expressed by the persons being prospected, this procedure having to ensure that the opposition expressed to the subcontractors carrying out the prospecting campaigns is transmitted to the company and passed on to the other subcontractors, that the opposition expressed to the company is transmitted to the subcontractors carrying out the prospecting campaigns, and to ensure that the calls made by the subcontracting teleoperators do not target persons who have already expressed their opposition to the processing of their personal data for prospecting purposes; - to regulate the relations between the company and its subcontractors carrying out telephone prospecting campaigns by legal acts meeting the criteria laid down in Articles 44 to 49 of the Regulation and to ensure, if the company chooses the standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission, that the clauses are signed by the parties and governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established, in this case France ; attach to the order a penalty payment of EUR 500 (five hundred) per day of delay at the end of a period of 1 (one) month following notification of this decision, with proof of compliance to be sent to the restricted formation within that period; for breaches of articles 5-1-c), 12, 13, 14, 21, 31 and 44, impose an administrative fine on FUTURA INTERNATIONALE in the amount of 500,000 (five hundred thousand) euros; to make public, on the CNIL site and on the Légifrance site, its decision, which will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from the date of its publication.

The SPARTOO company having had the floor last; The restricted committee adopted the following decision: I. Facts and procedure 1. The company SPARTOO SAS (hereinafter the company) is a simplified joint stock company created in 2006, specialized in the distance selling sector of shoes, whose head office is located at 16 rue Henri Barbusse, in Grenoble (38100 ). 2. In 2018, the company SPARTOO SAS achieved a net turnover of more than \[…\] euros and a negative net result of almost \[…\] euros. In the same year, the SPARTOO group, comprising the company SPARTOO SAS and its subsidiaries, achieved a net turnover of around \[…\] euros and a negative net result of around \[…\] euros. The SPARTOO group employs around 1000 people. 3. The company publishes, for the needs of its activity, sixteen websites within thirteen countries of the European Union, namely France, Spain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Denmark, Poland, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, the Czech Republic and Hungary as well as the United Kingdom. Two other websites (spartoo.eu) and (spartoo.net) are aimed at consumers from other countries paying in euros and dollars. 4. On May 31, 2018, in application of the President's decision no 2018-076C, a delegation from the National Commission for Informatics and Liberties (hereinafter the CNIL or the Commission) carried out a control mission in the premises of the company SPARTOO. The purpose of this mission was to verify that this company complied with all the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter the Regulation or the GDPR) and of the Law n ° 78-17 of January 6, 1978, as amended, relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter the law of January 6, 1978 as amended or the Data Protection Act). The control focused more particularly on the processing of personal data of the company's customers and prospects, as well as on the recording of telephone conversations between customers and the company's customer service employees. 5. During this control mission, the delegation was informed that the company implements processing aimed at combating fraud and unpaid debts, during payments made on its websites. When the 3DSecure protocol is not validated, an email is sent to the person who placed the order so that they can send proof of address and a scan of the front of their bank card. The company also informed the delegation that no retention period for personal data had been defined and that it was not carrying out any regular erasure of data relating to customers and prospects at the end of 'a defined period. 6. The delegation noted that in the context of recording telephone conversations between client advisers and clients, people calling the company could object to the recording of telephone calls by pressing a button on their telephone. . 7. Finally, the delegation noted that when creating an account by a user, on the company's website, passwords consisting of six digits, containing only one type of character, were accepted. The company also indicated that account passwords were kept in the production database in hashed form using the MD5 hash function, using a salt present directly in the database field relating to matching passwords. 8. Furthermore, following the audit, the company sent the Commission, by email of June 7, 2018, the additional documents requested and in particular a count made in the database relating to the number of customers and prospects not 'not being connected, since 2008, to its websites distributed in the different countries in which it is present. The following were provided by the company: - 118,768 customers whose personal data was present in the database had not connected since May 25, 2008; - 682,164 customers had not logged in since May 25, 2010; - 3,620,401 customers had not logged in since May 25, 2013; - 5,790,121 customers had not logged in since May 25, 2015; - 25,911,675 prospects had been inactive since May 25, 2015. 9. It also emerged from that statement that SPARTOO had more than \[...\] customer accounts and more than \[...\] prospects. 10. In addition, the company provided the CNIL, by email of June 27, 2018, with the new data protection policy for its various websites. 11. In accordance with article 56 of the RGPD, the CNIL informed on July 27, 2018 all the European supervisory authorities of its competence to act as the lead supervisory authority concerning the cross-border processing carried out by the company. and opening the procedure for the declaration of the authorities concerned on this case. 12. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission appointed Mr. Bertrand du MARAIS as rapporteur, on April 18, 2019, on the basis of article 47 of the law of January 6, 1978 amended in its version applicable on the day of designation. 13. By letter of May 17, 2019, the company was summoned by the rapporteur to a hearing on the following June 19, in application of article 74 of decree n ° 2005-1309 of October 20, 2005 as amended. 14. At the end of his investigation, the rapporteur had the company SPARTOO SAS notified by a bailiff, on September 23, 2019, of a report detailing the breaches of the GDPR that he considered constituted in this case. 15. This report proposed to the restricted formation of the Commission to issue an injunction to bring the processing into conformity with the provisions of Articles 5-1-c), 5-1 e), 13, 32 and 35-1 of the Rules, accompanied by a fine at the end of a period of three months following the notification of the deliberation of the restricted formation, as well as an administrative fine. He also proposed that this decision be made public and no longer allow the company to be identified by name after a period of two years from its publication. 16. Also attached to the report was an invitation to the restricted training session of November 28, 2019, indicating to the company that it had one month to submit its written observations. 17. On October 23, 2019, through its counsel, the company filed comments. The rapporteur replied on the following November 7. 18. On November 22, the company filed further observations in response to those of the rapporteur. 19. The company and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the restricted session on November 28, 2019. 20. The draft decision adopted by the restricted body was sent to the European supervisory authorities concerned on February 16, 2020, in accordance with Article 60.4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The restricted committee ruled, in its draft decision, on the breaches proposed by the rapporteur and discussed by the parties within the framework of the respect of the adversarial principle, namely the breaches of articles 5-1-c), 5 -1 e), 13, 32 and 35-1 of the GDPR; no breach of Article 6 of the GDPR and of Directive 2002/58 / EC of the Parliament and of the Council known as the ePrivacy Directive not having been raised by the rapporteur. 21. On March 13 and 17, the supervisory authorities in Italy, Portugal and Lower Saxony raised relevant and reasoned objections to the draft decision. The restricted formation decided to modify its draft decision in order to take these objections into account. As these did not propose to deviate from the draft decision by taking into account a new factual circumstance, to add a breach or to worsen the nature of the corrective measure initially proposed, the restricted committee decided not to communicate them to the reporter or to the SPARTOO company. 22. The revised draft decision was submitted to the relevant supervisory authorities on June 25, 2020. II. Reasons for the decision A. On the breach of the principle of data minimization (obligation to ensure the adequacy, relevance and non-excessive nature of the data) 23. Article 5-1 c) of the Regulation provides that personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed (data minimization). 24. First, the rapporteur maintains that the full and permanent recording of telephone calls received by customer service employees appears excessive in view of the purpose of their evaluation by the company. 25. The company contends that the telephone recordings are neither permanent nor systematic as customers have the option of objecting to the recording of the call. It also considers that the full recording of telephone conversations is proportionate to the objectives of evaluation and training of employees pursued by the company. Finally, she maintains that the rapporteur is wrong to assert that the recording of telephone calls would be excessive on the grounds that the person responsible for carrying out the training generally listens only to one recording per week, per employee, whereas this average would be, according to the company, likely to evolve according to the needs of the company. It specifies that the number of recordings that the trainer must be able to listen to must be greater than the number of recordings that he actually listens to. 26. The restricted training notes, first of all, that if certain customers object to the recording of the telephone call made, the company implements a treatment allowing to record all the telephone conversations of its employees, without them having the opportunity to oppose it. Next, it considers that the company does not justify the need to record all telephone conversations made by customer service, with regard to the purpose of the processing, namely the training of employees. The restricted training notes that the company indicated, during the hearing of June 19, 2019, that the person in charge of this training generally listens to only one recording per week and per employee. In addition, if the company affirmed, during the meeting of November 28, 2019, that the recording rate of telephone conversations went from 100% to 30%, it does not produce any supporting documents on this point. 27. While the number of records may vary depending on each employee and the circumstances, in particular the training needs of the latter, the restricted training considers that the company does not demonstrate that it has set up, for the past and 'future, a recording of employees' telephone conversations limited to what is necessary with regard to the purpose pursued. However, a controller cannot set up processing of personal data without ensuring that it is necessary for his needs, especially when it is based on a device that is particularly intrusive for employees. 28. The restricted committee therefore considers, in view of these elements, that a breach of Article 5-1-c) of the GDPR has occurred. 29. Secondly, the rapporteur criticizes the company for not having put in place measures to prevent the recording of customer bank details during telephone calls made with the company. He also considers that the measure proposed by the company, following the hearing, consisting in eliminating every day calls in connection with orders placed by telephone with payment by bank card, remains unsatisfactory in that the processing of data banking for a day is not justified with regard to the purpose of the processing, which is the evaluation of employees. He recalls that the processing of bank details is aimed at making payment and that such data does not have to be recorded by the company, even for a single day, once the payment has been validated. 30. The company maintains that the erasure of the bank data recorded during telephone conversations, every day, set up following the hearing of June 19, 2019, makes it possible to ensure data retention in accordance with the principle of minimization . It specifies that the implementation of a measure allowing a recording to be interrupted when a client's bank details are communicated would require the development of complex technical tools and would incur a particularly heavy financial and human cost. 31. The restricted group observes that the company has, at least until June 19, 2019, recorded during the recording of the conversations of employees for training purposes, the bank details of customers who placed orders by telephone and kept such data in its database, in clear, for fifteen days. 32. It notes that bank details are data which, given their nature and the associated risks of fraud, must be the subject of enhanced protection by data controllers. Indeed, as noted by the rapporteur, their use by unauthorized third parties, in the context of fraudulent payments, is likely to result in harm to the persons concerned. 33. The restricted formation notes that the company recorded and kept data for which it had no use with regard to the purpose of the processing in question, namely the training of employees. 34. It therefore considers, in view of these elements, that a breach of Article 5-1-c) of the GDPR has occurred. 2. Data collected in the context of the fight against fraud 35. First of all, the rapporteur maintains that the company disregards the principle of data minimization since it keeps, in the context of the fight against fraud, supporting documents sent by customers such as a copy of the national card identity, which are not required. 36. The company maintains that keeping a document spontaneously transmitted by a person is not excessive. It considers that it can keep copies of the national identity card of persons sent spontaneously to the extent that the CNIL indicates in its practical guide to online purchases that a data controller can request proof of identity and / or domicile to ascertain the identity of the holder. 37. The restricted committee notes that the company informed the CNIL, during the hearing on June 19, 2019, that it was asking customers located in France, for the purposes of combating fraud, to provide a copy of proof of address and a scan of their bank card. However, she told the Commission that even if she does not ask for a copy of the identity card to be provided, people sometimes communicate such a document to her and that in such a case she keeps this document for six months. , in the same way as the other supporting documents sent to it. 38. The restricted committee notes that a copy of the identity card may constitute relevant proof in the context of the fight against fraud. Consequently, in view of the purpose of the processing implemented by the company and the residual nature of the number of copies of identity cards processed by the company, it considers that there is no need to retain, in 'case, the alleged breach. 39. Secondly, the rapporteur pointed out in his report that the company collected, in Italy, as part of the fight against fraud, the copy of the health card (tessera sanitaria) and of the identity card in the process of being issued. validity. He criticized the company for not having been able to indicate at the hearing why the collection of this document is necessary in the context of the fight against fraud. Subsequently, the rapporteur took note of the information provided by the company according to which it indicated that its statements made during the hearing on June 19, 2019 were false and that in reality it was only asking customers for the communication of their identity card to the exclusion of any other documentary evidence. The latter also indicated that following a communication error, the sales department of the company asked, between June 27 and July 18, 2019, to customers to send a copy of this health card, but that this practice has ceased and that the documents thus collected have been deleted. The rapporteur therefore considered that there was no longer any need to take this fact into account in support of the aforementioned infringement. 40. The restricted committee notes that the Italian health card contains a significant amount of information on its holder, namely his name, first name, gender, tax code, place of birth corresponding for citizens born in Italy to the municipality of birth and for foreigners in the country of birth. It can also be inferred from the expiry date of the card that the person has a residence permit in Italy. 41. It considers that the communication of two documents making it possible to justify the identity of the person for the purposes of combating fraud, namely the health card and the identity document, was excessive and irrelevant for the purposes of article 5-1 c) of the GDPR. It appears that only the collection of the identity card was relevant with regard to the purpose of the processing carried out. In this case, the collection of the health card containing more information than the identity card, irrelevant in the fight against fraud, was excessive. In this regard, the restricted panel notes that the company recognizes that such collection was not necessary, it having ceased in July 2019. The restricted panel considers that even if the company would have collected such a document only during a limited period of three weeks, such elements constitute a breach of the obligation for the controller to process only adequate, relevant and limited data to what is necessary with regard to the purposes for which they are processed, under the principle of data minimization. 42. The restricted committee therefore considers that a breach of Article 5-1 c) of the GDPR is established for these facts. B. On the breach of the obligation to limit the retention period of data 43. Article 5-1 e) of the Regulation provides that personal data must be kept in a form allowing the identification of the persons concerned for a period not exceeding that necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. ; personal data may be kept for longer periods as long as they will be processed exclusively for archival purposes in the public interest, for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89 , paragraph 1, provided that the appropriate technical and organizational measures required by this Regulation are implemented in order to guarantee the rights and freedoms of the data subject (limitation of retention). 44. First of all, the rapporteur noted that during the control of May 31, 2018, the company informed the CNIL that no retention period for customer and prospect data had been determined and that it was not carrying out any erasure. regular or any archiving of such data after a defined period. During the hearing on June 19, 2019, the company informed the rapporteur that it had set a retention period for these data of five years, on an active basis, from the date of the last activity of customers and prospects, which may correspond for example , to a connection to the customer account, to a click in a newsletter or to the opening of this one. 45. To determine the number of customers and prospects to be taken into consideration, those located in the United Kingdom should be included, since that State was a member of the European Union at the time of the facts in question, the GDPR is applicable. In addition, as part of the withdrawal agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom, a transitional period has been agreed during which Union law continues to apply in the United Kingdom. 46. ​​The statements made by the company, at the request of the delegation of control, made it possible to establish that the company was keeping the data of 118,768 customers who had not logged into their account since May 25, 2008, those of 682,164 customers who have not logged into their account since May 25, 2010 and the data of 3,620,401 customers who have not logged into their account since May 25, 2013. 47. The limited training deduces that at least until the counting carried out on June 7, 2018 in the database, the company kept a particularly large amount of data concerning its customers who had not logged into their account for more than ten years. 48. In addition, the fact, alleged by the company, that only the legal manager has access to the stored customer data is in any event irrelevant, the retention period being independent of access. 49. Regarding prospects, the rapporteur considers that the company does not justify the need to apply a retention period for their data for five years from the last contact from them. 50. The company maintains, for its part, that the retention period of five years for such data is adequate given the specificity of its general e-commerce platform. In addition, it has been established that certain prospects log in to view the offers offered after a period of inactivity of four years. 51. The restricted committee notes that the company kept in June 2018, with regard to the various countries of the European Union in which the company operates and the United Kingdom, the data of more than 25 million prospects not having had no activity since May 25, 2015, i.e. for more than three years. In addition, as a significant example, the data of 4,801,596 prospects who had no activity for more than three years, concerning Spain, those of 5,616,503 prospects concerning Italy and those of more than 12 million prospects for France. The restricted committee notes that after having indicated to the services of the CNIL that the data was kept indefinitely, the company indicated, during the hearing, that it now keeps these data for five years from the last contact. , even though it maintains that it will no longer revive them after a period of inactivity of two years. The restricted committee considers that the company has not established how the conservation of the data of prospects, who are people who have never placed an order on the company's site or former customers whose data is used for prospecting purposes after the end of the commercial relationship, is necessary beyond the period of two years during which it carries out its prospecting operations. The company has indicated that it only sends messages promoting its products or containing commercial offers to its prospects for a period of two years. 52. On this point, the restricted committee considers that in this case, the duration of two years appears proportionate in view of the purpose of the processing. This period responds to the company's wish to promote, like any merchant, its products to its former customers and to people who have not objected to receiving such messages. The company further specifies that a mechanism allows people to unsubscribe at any time to no longer receive prospecting messages. On the other hand, the retention period put in place by the company with regard to prospect data, namely five years, exceeds that necessary with regard to the purposes for which they are processed. 53. The restricted committee therefore considers that the company has disregarded the provisions of Article 5-1 e) of the GDPR. 54. Secondly, the rapporteur criticizes the company for determining as the starting point for the retention period for prospect data, in particular the opening of a prospecting email. 55. The restricted training notes that prospect data allows a data controller to send messages, for example by e-mail, to people who show an interest in its products or services. The Commission considers in this regard that when the starting point of the data retention period is the last contact from the prospect, it must be an event making it possible to demonstrate the interest of the person in the message received, such as than a click on a hyperlink contained in an email. However, the mere opening of an email cannot be considered as a contact from the prospect, since the prospect may be opened unintentionally due to the operating methods of the email software used or by mistake. 56. The restricted committee therefore considers that the company cannot, without disregarding the principle of limiting the period of data retention, consider that the simple opening of a prospecting email by a person makes it possible to restart the starting point of the period of retention of prospect data and thus keep such data even though the prospects have not demonstrated, by a clear act, an interest in the products or services of the company for several years. 57. Thirdly, the rapporteur maintains that at the end of the period of retention of customer data, the company does not delete all of the data stored, but keeps the email addresses of customers as well. their passwords, in a pseudonymized form, which would not allow compliance with the principle of data retention limitation. 58. The company claims that the anonymization of e-mail addresses of former customers is carried out using a process based on SHA-256 technology and that decryption of hashed data with this function requires very sophisticated technical skills. It therefore considers that the data of inactive customers is indecryptable and therefore anonymous. 59. The training notes that at the end of a client's period of inactivity, the company deletes certain data, namely the name, first name and date of birth of the latter, but keeps other such data. as his email address and password which are hashed by an algorithm and transferred within another table. The company thus wishes to allow a customer to reconnect to his account with the same username and password as those used when creating his account, at the end of the data retention period set up. 60. The restricted committee considers that the data of its former clients, even chopped, is not anonymized, but pseudonymized, and would make it possible to re-identify people. 61. The company claims that the e-mail addresses and passwords of its former customers are hashed using a SHA-256 algorithm which is particularly robust and which would make the data anonymous. 62. The restricted panel noted that the SHA-256 algorithm is a hash function to ensure the integrity of personal data processed by the company. While this is, to date, a function that cannot be reversed and is therefore considered by the National Information Systems Security Agency (ANSSI) and the CNIL as guaranteeing a sufficient level of security for data, this does not make it possible to anonymize the data and therefore justify their storage indefinitely by a controller. 63. Consequently, the restricted body considers that the company keeps the data in question for a period exceeding that necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. It notes in this regard, that the company itself indicates that the objective of the implementation of such a measure is to allow its customers to reconnect to their account, even though the data is supposed to have been deleted. . The personal data of former customers must be permanently deleted at the end of the retention period for them in an active database or in an archive database, once the legal obligations have expired and cannot be kept for a hypothetical future use. . 64. The restricted committee therefore considers that the company has, once again, disregarded the provisions of Article 5-1 e) of the GDPR. C. On the breach of the obligation to inform people 65. Article 13 of the GDPR requires the data controller to provide, at the time the data is collected, information relating to his identity and contact details, those of the data protection officer, the purposes of the processing and its legal basis, the recipients of the personal data, where applicable the transfers of personal data, the retention period of the personal data, the rights enjoyed by individuals as well as the right to lodge a complaint with 'a supervisory authority. 66. As regards the clients, the rapporteur criticized the company for not informing them, within the data confidentiality policy, accessible on the company's website as well as via a link on the creation form account, that their data is transferred to Madagascar, in the context of telephone calls. He also criticized the company for citing within these documents only a single legal basis for all of its processing, namely consent, while some processing was based on a different legal basis. 67. The rapporteur noted, in his observations of 7 November 2019, that despite the company's claims, the privacy policy had not been corrected to include the transfer of data to Madagascar. 68. Regarding the legal bases of the processing, the company claimed that it based its processing on the consent of individuals, which, in its view, could not be criticized as this legal basis is more protective for individuals. people and therefore a failure to inform people could not be held against him with regard to these facts. 69. The restricted committee notes that it appears from the information provided by the company relating to the various processing operations implemented that several of them, namely, for example, the fight against fraud or those implemented within the framework of purchases made on the company's website cannot be based on the consent of individuals, but, as the rapporteur has indicated, on the contract or the legitimate interests pursued by the company. Recalling that recital 41 of the GDPR requires that the legal basis for processing be clear and precise, it considers that the company cannot aim solely within its data confidentiality policy as the legal basis of consent for all the processing operations implemented. artwork. 70. Consequently, if the company has indeed, as the texts require, integrated information on the legal basis and taken care to retain the most protective basis, according to it, of the rights of the people, the restricted formation recalls that Article 13 of the GDPR requires granular information relating to the legal basis of each treatment. It can therefore only note that the company has not fully complied with the provisions of this article by refraining from indicating, for each processing operation implemented, the corresponding legal basis in its confidentiality policy. 71. In addition, the restricted committee takes note of the changes made to its website, concerning the transfer of data to Madagascar. However, it considers that a breach of Article 13 of the GDPR is made until November 18, 2019, the date on which the company indicates that it has made changes to its website. 72. As regards the employees, the rapporteur criticizes the company for not informing them individually of the recording of their telephone calls. 73. The company maintains that employees are informed of the recording of telephone calls made with customers, thanks to several documents, such as a certificate of presence, information project telephone tapping dated January 14, 2016, a document from May 2014 as well as performance evaluation sheets dated 2017. The company has also provided certificates from three client advisers affirming that they have read the document dated January 14, 2016, that they have understood the purpose of these eavesdropping and that 'they can contact the legal department for further information. 74. The restricted training recalls that informing employees of the setting up of systems for listening and recording telephone conversations in the workplace is fundamental and is linked to the fair and transparent nature of any processing carried out. by a data controller. As indicated in recital 39 of the GDPR, the principle of transparency requires that all information and communication relating to the processing of such personal data is easily accessible, easy to understand, and formulated in clear and simple terms. 75. The obligation of transparency obliges the company to provide information relating to such a system to each employee, who cannot be satisfied with a single piece of information, as in this case in 2016, which would not be provided to new employees subsequently employed. 76. Moreover, the restricted committee also notes that Article L. 1222-4 of the Labor Code provides that no information concerning an employee personally can be collected by a device that has not been previously brought to his attention. . In addition, the Commission has recalled on several occasions, and in particular in a guide for employers and employees available on its website as well as in recommendation 2014-474 of 27 November 2014 relating to the recording of calls on the place of work, that employees must be provided with a certain amount of information regarding the treatments implemented by employers. 77. Finally, the restricted committee notes that the documents produced by the company do not provide employees with information relating to the purposes pursued by the processing, the legal basis of the system, the recipients of data from the system, the duration of data retention, their rights in particular of access to data concerning them as well as the possibility of filing a complaint with the CNIL, guaranteeing full information of employees in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR. 78. The restricted committee therefore considers, in view of these elements, that a breach of Article 13 of the GDPR has occurred. D. A breach of the obligation to ensure data security 79. Article 32-1 of the Regulation provides: Taking into account the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks, including the degree probability and severity vary, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee a level of security adapted to the risk and in particular the means to ensure the continued confidentiality, integrity, availability and resiliency of processing systems and services. 80. The controller must therefore, in accordance with article 32-2 of the GDPR, take into account the risks presented by the processing, resulting in particular from the destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorized disclosure of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or unauthorized access to such data, accidentally or unlawfully. 81. The CNIL delegation noted, during the inspection on May 31, 2018, that people wishing to create a user account on the company's website could create a password consisting of six characters comprising a single category of characters. During the hearing on June 19, 2019, the company clarified that, since the control of the CNIL, a one-minute blocking measure for the account was put in place, after 19 unsuccessful access attempts to an account at from a single IP address in less than a minute. 82. In defense, the company argues that it has changed the rules for constituting account passwords and now requires its customers to create passwords that are at least eight characters long. It also calls into question the recommendations of the CNIL in the matter and maintains that the technical recommendations in terms of securing passwords resulting from the deliberation n ° 2017-190 of June 22, 2017 of the Commission are the subject of contestation by cybersecurity experts. Maintaining that overly complex rules have led to the standardization of passwords, she preferred to opt for the imposition of short and simpler passwords, these being less predictable for a possible attacker, the hazard being based on a human logic. 83. The rapporteur maintains that passwords, consisting of six or eight characters, without complexity criteria, are not strong enough and do not ensure the security of data processed by the company. He considers that such passwords do not prevent brute force attacks which consist in successively and systematically testing numerous passwords and can thus lead to a compromise of the associated accounts and personal data which 'they contain. 84. The Restricted Panel considers that, contrary to what society maintains, the length and complexity of a password remain elementary criteria by which to assess the strength of it. It recalls that, to ensure a sufficient level of security and meet the requirements of password strength, when authentication is based solely on a username and password, the password must be at least twelve characters long - containing at least 12 characters. minus one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number and one special character - or the password must be at least eight characters long - containing three of these four categories of characters - and be accompanied by an additional measure such as timeout access to the account after several failures (temporary suspension of access, the duration of which increases with the number of attempts), the establishment of a mechanism to protect against automated and intensive submission of attempts (e.g. captcha) and / or blocking the account after several unsuccessful authentication attempts. 85. The restricted committee notes that the need for a strong password is also emphasized by ANSSI, which indicates that a good password is above all a strong password, that is to say difficult to find. even using automated tools. The strength of a password depends on its length and the number of possibilities available for each character in it. This is because a password made up of lower case letters, upper case letters, special characters and numbers is technically more difficult to discover than a password made up of all lower case letters. 86. In the present case, it considers that the strength of a password consisting of eight characters and only one category of characters is very weak and that the company does not at any time demonstrate how a password is short and simple would be more likely to resist a brute force attack than a password consisting of more characters and multiple categories of characters. 87. The restricted committee therefore considers that the passwords set up by the company to access the accounts created on its website do not meet the required requirements in terms of robustness. 88. It was noted, during the control of May 31, 2018, that the company asks its customers, as part of the fight against fraud, to send it by email a scan of the bank card used when ordering. For its customers in France, an email specifying the 16 digits on the front panel, please let appear at least the first 4 and the last 4, the validity date and the name of the holder must appear clearly is then sent to the persons. E-mails making such a request are also sent to people ordering on the Italian, Spanish, Hungarian, Slovak, Danish and Greek sites. the company was found to keep bank card scans unblocked. 89. The rapporteur therefore considers that the company's email addressed to people, particularly French people, encourages them to provide a full copy of the payment card instead of inviting customers to hide a minimum number of their bank card numbers. 90. It was further noted that bank card scans are kept by the company in the clear for six months from the registration of the documents, in the event of a dispute. 91. By letter of June 28, 2019, the company indicated that an online platform dedicated to sending supporting documents would be set up at the end of August 2019. Furthermore, the company maintains that it has been authorized by the CNIL to implement processing for the purpose of combating fraud and that it can validly collect the expiry dates and truncated bank card numbers. 92. In the first place, the restricted committee notes that the company was indeed authorized by deliberation of the CNIL of July 2, 2009 to process the truncated bank card number as well as the expiry date, as part of the implementation implementation of processing for the purpose of combating fraud. However, it is established that the company processed copies of customers' bank cards containing full numbers, while it was only allowed to process a truncated portion of them. The restricted committee therefore considers that the authorization issued by the CNIL cannot justify the processing of all customer bank card numbers. 93. Secondly, the restricted committee notes that it was noted by the CNIL delegation that the system set up by the company allowed customers to send unencrypted, by unencrypted email from their electronic mailbox. , photographs or scans of their bank card containing the full number of the bank card and that such data was kept, in the same way as the supporting documents requested in the context of the fight against fraud, for six months, in clear in the database. 94. Under these conditions, the restricted committee considers that the company has not put in place, at least until August 2019, security measures to guarantee the security of its customers' banking data. 95. On the basis of all of these elements, the restricted panel considers that the breach of article 32 of the Rules has been established. E. On corrective measures and their publicity 96. Under III of article 20 of the amended law of 6 January 1978: When the data controller or his subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or from this law, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms may also, if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, if necessary in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, seize the restricted committee with a view to pronouncing, after contradictory procedure, of one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 2 ° An injunction to bring the processing into line with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or from this law or to meet the requests presented by the data subject in order to exercise their rights, which may be accompanied, except in cases where the processing is implemented by the State, a penalty payment the amount of which may not exceed € 100,000 per day of delay from the date set by the restricted group; \[…\] 7 ° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the worldwide annual turnover total for the previous financial year, whichever is higher. Under the assumptions mentioned in 5 and 6 of article 83 of regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are raised, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted committee takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83. 97. Article 83 of the GDPR provides: 1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 2. Depending on the specific characteristics of each case, administrative fines are imposed in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in Article 58 (2) (a) to (h) and (j). In deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the amount of the administrative fine, due account shall be taken in each individual case of the following: a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage they suffered; (b) whether the violation was committed willfully or negligently; c) any measure taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects; d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical and organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32; e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or processor; f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach and mitigating any negative effects thereof; g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach; (h) how the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, including whether, and to what extent, the controller or processor notified the breach; (i) where measures referred to in Article 58 (2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the same purpose, compliance with those measures; (j) the application of codes of conduct approved under Article 40 or certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or indirectly, as a result of the violation. 98. First, concerning the fine proposed by the rapporteur, the company maintains that it was never condemned by the CNIL, that it had few references before the entry into force of the RGPD and that the Commission announced a tolerance period for new breaches of the GDPR, such as data minimization or pseudonymization. 99. The restricted panel considers that, in the present case, the aforementioned breaches justify the imposition of an administrative fine against the company for the following reasons. 100. First of all, it notes that, contrary to what the company maintains, the shortcomings found relate, for the most part, to obligations that Law No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 as amended already imposed on data controllers. and which did not arise from the GDPR, including with regard to the principle of minimizing and limiting the duration of data retention. It further recalls that questions relating to the pseudonymization of data were asked well before the entry into force of the GDPR. 101. Next, it notes that several of these breaches concern employees and in particular their right to receive information on the processing of their personal data. Here again, the restricted training recalls that this is not a novelty introduced following the entry into force of the GDPR. 102. Finally, it underlines that bank data is data that must be the subject of particular vigilance by data controllers and that the Commission has continued to support them on this subject for many years. 103. Secondly, the company underlines its cooperation with the rapporteur and the measures put in place, as well as certain sanctions previously imposed by the restricted party. It also considers that it cannot be blamed for a lack of speed, when the hearing took place a year after the check carried out on its premises and when no formal notice was notified to it within this time. 104. The restricted committee notes that although several measures were put in place by the company in order to remedy in whole or in part certain shortcomings, these were only adopted following the control of the CNIL on the 31st. May 2018, with regard to the establishment of retention periods for customer and prospect data and that following the hearing of June 19, 2019, and the report, regarding the deletion of records containing customer bank details and information to individuals on the website relating to the transfer of their data outside the European Union. 105. Next, the restricted committee considers that the seriousness of certain breaches is characterized. More particularly with regard to the failure to record telephone conversations, the restricted committee notes that the company recorded for several years all the telephone conversations of its employees, even though it had none. utility and that such treatment can be compared to constant monitoring. It also notes that employee information about the implementation of the call recording system is particularly deficient, it being either incomplete before 2016, or non-existent for employees hired by the company subsequently. 106. In addition, the seriousness of the breaches is characterized in view of the particular category of personal data processed by the company, namely banking data which is considered to be data exposing people to a risk of fraud, and therefore of damage, and must therefore be the subject of special vigilance. Finally, the restricted committee also considers that the seriousness is characterized because of the number of people affected by the breaches, in particular with regard to the retention periods of data, which has affected several thousand people. 107. The company then claims to be a medium-sized business and to operate in a particularly competitive sector. It considers that a high administrative fine would affect its financial health and commercial position. 108. In this regard, the restricted committee considers that the company is an established player in e-commerce, and that, created long before the entry into force of the GDPR, it could not ignore the basic rules of the protection of personal data. 109. Next, the restricted panel recalls that § 3 of Article 83 of the Rules provides that in the event of multiple violations, as is the case in this case since four breaches are characterized, the total amount of the fine may not exceed the amount set for the most serious violation. Insofar as the company is accused of a breach of Articles 5 and 12 of the Regulation, the maximum amount of the fine that may be retained is 20 million euros or 4% of annual worldwide turnover, the higher amount being retained. 110. However, the restricted committee also takes into account, in determining the fine imposed, the measures that the company has taken during the sanction procedure to partially comply as well as the cooperation with the Commission services. . 111. Third, concerning the need to issue an injunction, the company considers that a formal notice without penalty would be more appropriate given the speed already observed in order to comply with several breaches. 112. Without ignoring the steps taken by the company to comply with the GDPR, the restricted committee considers that the company has not demonstrated, on the day of the closing of the investigation, the total compliance of the treatments it puts implemented in Articles 5-1-c), 5-1 e) 13 and 32 of the Regulation. 113. If the company fails to comply with these breaches, an injunction should be issued. 114. Fourthly, the restricted committee considers that the publication of the sanction is justified in view of the importance of the issues raised concerning the employees, as well as the nature of the data in question, whereas the company is a major player in the sector. in which it intervenes. 115. It follows from all of the above and taking into account the criteria set out in Article 83 of the GDPR that an administrative fine of up to 250,000 euros, an injunction accompanied by a fine as well as an additional penalty publication for a period of two years are justified and proportionate. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: Issue an injunction against the company SPARTOO SAS to bring the processing into conformity with the obligations resulting from articles 5-1 c), article 5-1 e), 13 and 32 of Regulation No. 2016/679 of April 27 2016 relating to data protection, and in particular: · Regarding the breach of the principle of minimization of personal data: o justify the end of non-one-off and non-random recordings of advisers' telephone conversations when the purpose pursued is their training or evaluation; With regard to the breach of the principle of limiting the retention period of data, define and implement a retention period policy for data relating to customers and prospects that does not exceed the period necessary for the purposes for which they are collected and processed, and in particular: o justify the intermediate archiving procedure for customer personal data put in place, after sorting the relevant data to be archived and deleting irrelevant data, as well as the starting point for this archiving; o justify the restriction of employees' access to personal data present in the active database to only those who need to know it; o stop processing the data of prospects beyond the period after which the company no longer contacts them (in this case two years) and stop taking into account, as the last point of contact emanating from them, the simple opening of an email; o stop keeping the e-mail addresses and hashed passwords of former customers at the end of the fixed period of inactivity and proceed with the purging of such data kept by the company until the date of the deliberation of the restricted formation ; o justify the deletion of data concerning customers beyond the defined period of inactivity, for which it will be up to the company to justify, and concerning prospects beyond two years of inactivity; · With regard to the failure to inform people: o inform employees about the implementation of a device for recording telephone conversations, particularly concerning the purposes pursued, the legal basis of the device, the recipients of data from the device, the retention period of the data , the rights of employees, in particular access to data concerning them, the possibility of lodging a complaint with the CNIL; o provide complete information to customers, by providing information relating to the various legal bases of the processing carried out by the company; With regard to the breach of the obligation to ensure the security of personal data, take any measure, for all the processing of personal data implemented, to preserve the security of this data and prevent that unauthorized third parties have access to it in accordance with Article 32 of the GDPR, in particular: o implement a binding password management policy for customer accounts according to one of the following methods; § passwords are at least twelve characters long, containing at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number and one special character; § Passwords are made up of at least eight characters, containing three of the four categories of characters (upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and special characters) and are accompanied by an additional measure such as the account access timeout after several failures (temporary suspension of access, the duration of which increases with the number of attempts), the establishment of a mechanism to guard against automated and intensive submission of attempts (eg: captcha) and / or blocking of the account after several unsuccessful authentication attempts (maximum ten); Attach a fine of 250 (two hundred and fifty) euros per day of delay at the end of a period of 3 (three) months following the notification of this deliberation, the proof of compliance to be sent to the restricted committee within this period; For breaches of Articles 5-1 c), 5-1 e), 13 and 32 of the GDPR, pronounce against the company SPARTOO SAS an administrative fine in the amount of 250,000 (two hundred and fifty thousand) euros; · Make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the company by name after the expiration of a period of two years from its publication.

The company CARREFOUR FRANCE having had the last word ; The restricted formation adopted the following decision: I. Facts and procedure 1. CARREFOUR FRANCE (hereinafter the Company) is a subsidiary of the CARREFOUR Group (hereinafter the Group), located at 93 avenue de Paris in Massy (91300), which is active in a number of areas. Its main activity is mass distribution, but the group has diversified its activities, for example by operating in the banking and insurance sectors, as well as as as a travel agency and a salesman specializing in online commerce. 2. In 2019, the CARREFOUR group employed around 360,000 people, had a turnover of around 80 billion euros and an adjusted net profit, group share, of 905 million euros, up from 2018 (804 million euros). In 2019, CARREFOUR FRANCE generated sales of approximately 14 million euros, with a net loss of approximately 1.6 billion euros. 3. The CARREFOUR Group is notably made up of the parent company CARREFOUR SA, which owns 99.61% of CARREFOUR FRANCE. The latter owns 82% of CARREFOUR HYPERMARKETS and 99% of CARREFOUR PROXIMITÉ FRANCE. In 2019, CARREFOUR HYPERMARKETS had revenues of 14.3 billion euros and CARREFOUR PROXIMITÉ FRANCE had revenues of 636 million euros. 4. For the needs of its activity, the company CARREFOUR FRANCE publishes in particular the website www.carrefour.fr (hereafter the carrefour.fr website), enabling its customers to create and access a personal space and to place orders. 5. Between June 8, 2018 and April 6, 2019, the Commission received fifteen complaints from individuals relating to the companies of the CARREFOUR group. 6. Seven of these referrals (Nos. 18018909, 18019816, 18022931, 18023308, 18023417, 19002040 and 19002339) referred to commercial prospecting even though the persons concerned had previously expressed their opposition. 7. 7. Four of these referrals (Nos. 18011774, 18013824, 19001602 and 19006872) followed requests for the deletion of data that had not been granted. 8. 8. Three of these seizures (Nos. 18024794, 19001627 and 19004654) were the result of requests for access to data that had not been granted. 9. One seizure (no. 19000325) was an unsubscription link in a commercial prospecting e-mail. 10. Pursuant to Decisions No. 2019-081C of April 24, 2019 and No. 2019-102C of June 6, 2019 of the President of the Commission, five checks were carried out online or at the Company's premises : - an online control, carried out on May 24, 2019, relating to the carrefour.fr site and the processing implemented from this site ; - an on-site inspection, carried out on May 28, 2019, relating to the processing implemented by CARREFOUR FRANCE, in particular within the framework of the Carrefour loyalty program (hereafter the loyalty program), as well as the various databases used by the company for the management of its customers; - an on-site audit, carried out on June 11 and 12, 2019, relating to the exercise of rights and the responses given to several complainants who have filed a claim against the company with the CNIL; - an on-site inspection, carried out on June 26 and 27, 2019, relating more specifically to the management of personal data in the context of the loyalty program; - an on-site inspection, carried out on July 11, 2019, relating to the security measures developed by CARREFOUR FRANCE to protect the personal data it processes and to data breaches that have occurred. 11. The purpose of these missions was to verify the company's compliance with all the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter the Regulation or the RGPD) and Act 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended relating to information technology, files and liberties (hereinafter the Act of January 6, 1978 or the Information Technology and Civil Liberties Act). 12. Various exchanges have taken place by e-mail between the company and the delegation of control. These exchanges concerned the transmission of documents requested during inspections. On December 5, 2019, the Company sent written comments to the delegation of control, covering most of the points raised during the audits and announcing various actions aimed at bringing the Company into compliance. 13. 13. In order to examine these elements, the Chairman of the Commission appointed Mr. Éric PÉRÈS as rapporteur on December 10, 2019, on the basis of Article 22 of the Law of January 6, 1978. 14. At the end of his investigation, the rapporteur had a bailiff serve on CARREFOUR FRANCE, on January 10, 2020, a report detailing the breaches of the RGPD, the French Data Protection Act and the French Post and Electronic Communications Code that he considered to be present in this case. 15. This report proposed to the restricted formation of the Commission to issue an injunction to bring the processing into compliance with the provisions of articles 5, 12, 13, 15, 17, 21, 32 and 33 of the Regulation and article 82 of the French Data Protection Act, accompanied by a penalty payment and an administrative fine. It also proposed that this decision be made public and that the company no longer be identified by name after a period of two years from its publication. 16. On January 29, 2020, the company requested a one-month extension of the deadline by which it had to respond to the report, the postponement of the meeting initially scheduled for March 24, 2020 and a meeting with the rapporteur. On February 3, the chairman of the restricted panel granted the requested one-month extension. On February 6, the Secretary General of the CNIL granted the request to postpone the session to April 21, 2020. The same day, the rapporteur refused the meeting requested by the company. 17. On March 10, 2020, through its board, the company produced observations and made a request for the meeting before the restricted panel to be held in camera. 18. By e-mail dated March 23, 2020 and on the basis of Article 40, paragraph 4, of Decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019, the rapporteur asked the chairman of the restricted formation for an additional fifteen days to respond to the company's observations. 19. By letter dated March 24, 2020, noting in particular the context of the health crisis, the chairman of the restricted formation granted the rapporteur's request. 20. In a letter dated the same day, the Company was informed of the additional time period granted to the rapporteur and of the fact that, pursuant to paragraph 5 of Article 40 of Decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019, it had a period of one month in which to respond to the rapporteur's reply. The letter also informed him of the postponement of the restricted session, initially scheduled for April 21, 2020. 21. By e-mail dated April 7, 2020, the rapporteur asked the chairman of the restricted session for a further fifteen days to respond to the company's comments, which was granted on April 8, 2020. The company was informed of this on the same day. 22. The rapporteur responded to the company's observations on April 22, 2020. 23. By a letter of the same day, the secretary general of the CNIL informed the company that it could transmit its observations to the rapporteur's reply until August 24, 2020 in application of the order no. 2020-306 of March 25, 2020 relating to the extension of the deadlines due during the period of health emergency. 24. On June 30, 2020, the chairman of the restricted formation granted the company's request for an in camera hearing on the grounds that certain items included in the proceedings were protected by business secrecy, as provided for in Article L151-1 of the French Commercial Code. 25. On August 5, 2020, the services of the CNIL notified the Company of a notice to attend the meeting of the restricted session of September 17, 2020. 26. On August 24 and again on September 15, the company submitted new observations in response to those of the rapporteur. 27. The company and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the restricted session. II. Reasons for Decision A. On the failure to comply with the obligation to keep personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed 28. Article 5-1 e) of the Regulation provides that personal data must be kept in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data are processed. 1. The data of customers who are members of the loyalty program and of users of the carrefour.fr website must be kept for a period not exceeding that necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. 29. On the one hand, the rapporteur criticizes the company for having set retention periods that exceed the periods necessary for the purposes of processing. On the other hand, he reproaches the company for having kept personal data for a longer period than that provided for. 30. 30. The Company acknowledges these points, but recalls that it had decided, prior to the CNIL controls, to reduce the retention periods of its inactive customers and that it had begun the purging operations necessary to comply with these new periods. It also indicates having completed all these operations during the sanction procedure. 31. On the first point, the restricted session recalls that, on the day of the inspections, the company indicated that the data of loyalty customers were kept on an active basis for four years from their last activity (this could be understood, depending on the situation, as the last transaction with the loyalty card at the checkout of a store, the last online transaction, the last modification of the personal space on the company's website or the last contact with customer service). 32. It reminds that the loyalty program established by the company aims at the commercial prospecting of its members, as it emerges from the information mentions present on the membership form. The restricted session notes that the customers of the mass distribution, a fortiori those of a loyalty program, are customers who usually return regularly to the same stores. Consequently, it considers that a customer who has not traded with the company for several years should no longer be considered an active customer. By way of illustration, both the former Simplified Standard No. 48 relating to customer-prospect files and online sales and the recent draft standard on personal data processing implemented for the purpose of managing business activities recommend that the data of inactive customers be retained for a period of three years from the last contact with the Company. While this period is indicative and is not imposed as such on data controllers, the restricted session considers that it constitutes a reference for assessing an appropriate duration. In this case, it notes that this duration is already significant in the mass retail sector. While the specific features of the processing implemented by CARREFOUR FRANCE, and in particular the extensive interconnection of its databases, may justify that this three-year period is not considered excessive, the restricted session considers that it cannot be extended to the four-year period initially set by the company. Considering this purpose of commercial canvassing for loyalty processing, it considers that a four-year retention period was not strictly necessary for the purpose pursued, and therefore excessive. 33. 33. Nevertheless, it notes that the Company has, prior to the initiation of control procedures, initiated a plan to reduce this retention period to three years for all of its databases. In view of the interconnection between the Company's various databases and the operational need to set the same retention period for all its data, the three-year retention period for inactive customers appears proportionate to the purpose pursued. 34. On the second point, the restricted session notes, firstly, that the company acknowledges a delay in the implementation of its data erasure program but emphasizes the significant efforts made since the initiation of the procedure to bring itself into compliance. The limited session notes that the delegation of control has identified data concerning customers who have been inactive for more than four years, including more than twenty-eight million loyalty program customers who have been inactive for five to ten years. With regard to users of the carrefour.fr website, the restricted session emphasizes that the data of more than 750,000 users whose purchases were made between five and ten years ago, and nearly 20,000 users whose last purchase was made more than ten years ago, were kept. 35. 35. The restricted formation therefore considers, in view of these elements, that a breach of article 5-1-e) of the RGPD is constituted. 36. However, the restricted session underlines the very important organizational and financial means deployed by the company and notes, on the day of the session, the compliance of the company's practices with the Regulation. Indeed, the latter demonstrates that it has set up an automated system for deleting the data of its customers (both from the loyalty program and the carrefour.fr site) that have been inactive for more than three years. 2. Identity documents kept within the framework of the exercise of the rights of access to the site. 37. The rapporteur criticises the company for having kept for a period of one to six years the identity documents communicated to it by the persons concerned in the context of the exercise of a right. He considers that this period is excessive, as the data is kept beyond the time necessary to achieve the purpose for which it is processed. 38. On this point, the company points out the change in these practices since the notification of the sanction report, with identity documents being retained only for the period relating to the processing of the request in question. 39. The restricted session notes that the control delegation did indeed note that copies of applicants' national identity cards were kept by the company for a period of between one and six years. 40. It considers that, once the application has been granted, the company no longer needs to keep a copy of the applicant's identity document. The sole purpose of providing this document is to prove the identity of the person from whom the application emanates and it is not necessary to keep it once the identity has been confirmed. 41. The restricted panel also considers that, in order to demonstrate that it has actually granted the request, the company may, as an intermediate filing for litigation purposes, retain only the letter of favorable response, an element whose retention presents, incidentally, a lesser risk for the person concerned. 42. It therefore considers, in light of these elements, that a breach of Article 5-1-e) of the RGPD is constituted. 43. 43. It nevertheless highlights the changes made upon notification of the report and observes that the company's new practices are, on the day of the meeting, in compliance with the Regulation. It has in fact been shown that identity documents are now abolished as soon as the request has been granted. B. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions for the exercise of rights 44. Article 12 of the Regulation provides, on the one hand, that the controller shall facilitate the exercise of the rights conferred on the data subject under Articles 15 to 22. In the cases referred to in Article 11(2), the controller shall not refuse to comply with the data subject's request to exercise the rights conferred on him/her by Articles 15 to 22 unless the controller establishes that he/she is not able to identify the data subject and that where the controller has reasonable doubts as to the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, he/she may request additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject . 45. It also provides that the controller shall provide the data subject with information on the measures taken following a request made pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 as soon as possible and in any case within one month of receipt of the request. If necessary, this period may be extended by two months, taking into account the complexity and number of requests. The controller shall inform the data subject of such extension and the reasons for the extension within one month of receipt of the request. 46. Firstly, the rapporteur noted that, except in cases of opposition to the processing of data for commercial prospecting purposes, the company systematically requested proof of identity when exercising a right. 47. 47. The company stressed, during its discussions with the rapporteur, that this practice was discontinued as of October 23, 2019. 48. The restricted formation notes that the company did not reserve the request for a proof of identity to cases where there was reasonable doubt as to the identity of the person, this request being systematic. It emphasizes that the presence (noted during the inspections) of proof of identity accompanying the requests, as well as the company's letters in response communicated to the CNIL by the complainants, demonstrated the existence of this practice. Indeed, the CNIL was informed of a request to this effect in the case of Messrs. \[...\], \[...\], \[...\], \[...\], \[...\], \[...\], \[...\], \[...\] and \[...\] and Mrs. \[...\] without the company having any reasonable doubts as to the identity of the person. 49. The restricted panel considers that the systematic nature of requests for proof of identity, recognized by the society, is sufficient to show that these requests were not limited to situations where the society had reasonable doubts as to the identity of the natural person making the request . 50. It therefore considers, in view of these elements, that a failure to comply with article 12 of the RGPD is constituted. 51. Nevertheless, it highlights the changes made by the company and notes that the company's new practices are, on the day of the meeting, in compliance with the Regulation. It is in fact demonstrated that letters in response to requests to exercise rights no longer systematically require proof of identity. 52. Secondly, the rapporteur criticizes the company for the delay in responding to requests to exercise rights. He points out that response times vary but can be as long as nine months, without any information being communicated to the persons concerned in the meantime. He believes that these processing delays are recurrent. As an illustration, Ms. \[...\]'s request for deletion and objection was received on July 4, 2018. The withdrawal of her consent to advertising prospecting was entered into the database on April 15, 2019, more than nine months later. Mr. \[...\]'s request for access was received on November 7, 2018 and a response was provided on June 10, 2019, more than seven months later. Mr. \[...\]'s request for access and opposition was registered in the JIRA tool on January 10, 2019. However, it appears from the documents communicated to the CNIL by the complainant that the company acknowledged receipt of his first request as early as November 9, 2018. An answer was given to his request concerning the opposition to prospecting on June 11, 2019, i.e. more than seven months later. 53. On this point, the company acknowledges, both in its second response to the rapporteur's observations and during the restricted session, a chronic delay in the processing of applications at the time of the inspection. However, it emphasizes the particularly significant efforts made since the audit operations, the in-depth restructuring of the organization of the teams working on these issues, and the transformation of their working methods, with in particular the development of new ad hoc tools that improve the allocation and processing of requests to exercise rights, reducing their processing time and the risk of error. 54. The Panel observes that the company's organization was structurally causing a delay in the processing of applications and notes that the company indicates that this structural failure was due to a misunderstanding of the consequences of the GAR. The implementation of the DMPR increased the number of applications the company had to deal with in unexpected proportions (from one to two applications per day prior to the implementation of the DMPR to sometimes more than 75 applications per day after May 25, 2018). 55. The limited session notes that this lack of anticipation has had direct consequences for the people exercising their rights, sometimes forcing them to formalize several reminders in the face of the silence kept by society. The restricted formation therefore considers, in light of these elements, that a breach of article 12 of the RGPD has been established. 56. 56. It nevertheless underlines the profound and effective changes made by the company and notes that the company's new practices are, on the day of the meeting, in compliance with the Regulations. The company now shows an average response time to requests of less than fifteen days, sometimes even less than ten days. It also shows that no more responses have been sent out after the deadline since the change in its internal processes and the development of new tools. C. On the failure to provide information to individuals 57. Article 12 of the DPMR provides that the controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 \[...\] regarding the processing operation to the data subject in a concise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible manner and in plain and simple terms \[...\]. Articles 13 and 14 list the information that must be given to data subjects when personal data are collected directly from them and indirectly. 1. With regard to the accessibility of the information 58. Firstly, the rapporteur considers that the information provided was not easily accessible. 59. With regard firstly to the information communicated on the carrefour.fr website, he notes that the multiplicity of pages to be consulted, the links present in the various pages, and the redundancy of the information do not make it possible to consider that the information relevant to individuals is easily accessible. 60. With regard to the information communicated to people joining the loyalty program online, the rapporteur considers that the information was not easily accessible since it was included in the general terms and conditions of use of the Carrefour card. 61. Finally, with regard to the information provided to people who subscribe to the loyalty program by means of a paper form, the rapporteur notes that the information was not easily accessible either. Indeed, he notes that the bulletin summarized the essential information and referred to the home page of the carrefour.fr website for more complete information, without giving any further details. 62. On these points, the company claims that a page dedicated to data protection was directly accessible via a hypertext link at the foot of the page, and that it modified the information mentions on its website on November 22, 2019, i.e. prior to the opening of the sanction procedure and the notification of the report. These significant changes included the merging of all the information in a single document, the retention of a page dedicated to the exercise of the various rights, and a reformulation of the information provided to make it more readable, more precise and simpler. 63. The restricted session notes that the company has chosen to provide information at several levels, as permitted by the Regulation. 64. 64. In this configuration, the restricted class considers it particularly important that the information remain easily accessible, as required by section 12 of the Regulation. The presentation of information in multiple layers increases the risk that the information will be more difficult to find. Recital 39 of the DPMR underlines that the principle of transparency requires that all information and communication relating to the processing of personal data should be easily accessible, easy to understand, and formulated in clear and simple terms. Recital 58 also states that the principle of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to the data subject should be concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and formulated in clear and simple terms and, furthermore, where appropriate, illustrated with visual elements. 65. In this case, the restricted formation considers, on the one hand, that access to the information mentions on the carrefour.fr site was difficult, since they were grouped together in article 3 of the general conditions of use of the carrefour.fr site, which the user therefore had to browse. It is the same for the mentions of information relating to the loyalty program which appeared in article 10 of the general conditions of use of the Carrefour card. 66. These two documents were so long that the user had to scroll through a large number of pages and read several dozen paragraphs (about fifteen in the general conditions of use of the carrefour.fr website, more than seventy in the general conditions of use of the Carrefour card) before being able to find the information relating to the protection of his personal data. Consequently, the restricted session considers that the access to this information was not easy and that the user had to show a particular determination to access information on these issues. It recalls that information must be presented in an efficient and succinct manner in order to avoid drowning the information to be delivered among other informative content. 67. The difficulty of accessing this information was further compounded by its redundancy. In fact, since the information relating to the protection of personal data was scattered and fragmented among several documents (general terms and conditions of use, general terms and conditions of sale, page relating to the protection of personal data, page dedicated to the exercise of rights), some information was only present on certain pages, while others were presented several times. 68. So that the user does not have to search for relevant information, the restricted session considers that this information should be grouped together in a single document separate from the general conditions of use. It shares here the position developed by the G29 in the Guidelines on Transparency within the meaning of the Regulation adopted in their revised version on 11 April 2018 (hereafter the Transparency Guidelines) which considers that the data subject should not have to actively search for the information covered by these Articles among other information such as the terms and conditions of use of a website. 69. It also considers that when a data controller chooses to communicate information to data subjects at several levels, it is important not only that the second level of information details all the information relating to the processing operation, but also that the first level of information presents the essential characteristics of the processing operation. This requirement of accessibility, as enlightened by Recital 39 of the DPMR, is notably recalled in the guidelines on transparency. In particular, the G29 recommends that the first level/modality should include details of the purpose of the processing, the identity of the controller and a description of the rights of the data subjects. 70. However, the restricted session notes that the first level of information on the carrefour.fr site, accessible from the link personal data, did not provide this essential information but only some general information such as the possibility for data subjects to consult the personal data concerning them or to exercise the various rights they enjoy, or one of the purposes of the processing (the presentation of personalized offers). 71. Concerning the persons who subscribe to the loyalty program through the paper newsletter, the restricted session considers that, by referring these persons to the carrefour.fr site without further details, the company has not made the information easily accessible. The company should, at the very least, have specified the page or URL address where this information was available. The restricted session notes that this lack of accessibility by a simple reference to the home page of the site was aggravated by the previously underlined defects concerning the carrefour.fr site. 72. Secondly, the rapporteur considers that the information provided was not written in clear and simple terms. 73. He considers that all of the information mentions (in the general conditions of use of the carrefour.fr site, the paper forms for joining the loyalty program and for joining the same program via the customer area of the carrefour.fr site) used imprecise and unclear terms and were not easily understandable because of their layout. 74. 74. On this point, the company highlights the significant changes made to the information mentions prior to the opening of the sanction procedure. It indicates that it has, as of November 2019, put online a specific information page on the protection of personal data, separate from the general terms of use, accessible directly from the home page by a hypertext link. 75. The restricted session notes that the information mentions on the carrefour.fr website (both in the general terms and conditions of use and in the process of joining the loyalty program) and on the paper registration forms contained, at the time of the audit on May 24, 2019, unclear, ambiguous or imprecise wording. The use, in an almost systematic way in particular in the general conditions of use of the carrefour.fr website and the loyalty program, of terms such as these treatments include, in particular, for one or more of the following reasons or your data may be used do not allow the persons concerned to fully understand the treatments implemented. In the same way, formulas such as you also have a right to obtain the limitation of a processing and a right to the portability of the data that you may have provided, which will apply in certain cases (general conditions of use of the Carrefour card) do not provide complete information to the persons concerned, since the latter cannot understand, upon reading them, the situations in which these rights are open to them and the terms and conditions to enforce them. 76. The general conditions of use of the site carrefour.fr and the loyalty program included, in the majority of cases, only examples relating to the data collected (we may possibly have data from the open Data), the operations carried out or the purposes pursued (your data may be subject to processing for one or more of the following reasons), or general and evasive formulations. However, the restricted formation recalls that Recital 39 of the GDPR stresses the importance of the principle of transparency, stating that individuals should be informed of the risks, rules, guarantees and rights related to the processing of personal data and of the ways in which they can exercise their rights with regard to such processing. The Restricted session calls for the information provided to be of paramount importance, since its compliance is a condition for the validity of the individual's commitment and willingness to allow the processing of personal data by a particular controller. The data subject should be able, on reading the information communicated to him or her, to understand the general scope of the processing, which is not the case here. 77. The formulations used, often unnecessarily complicated, made the reading of the information statements particularly tedious, even for an enlightened person. For example, a sentence such as you may ask to exercise your right to object, for reasons relating to your particular situation, to a processing of personal data concerning you when the processing is based on the legitimate interest of the data controller, including the profiling extracted from the general conditions of the carrefour.fr site, does not allow a lay user to understand the existence, the scope, or the conditions for exercising his right to object. It is the same for the sentence your data may be transmitted to all or part of the following recipients : ...\] partner brands, but in this case the latter have no direct or indirect access to data concerning you and only data related to your profile without it being possible to identify you directly or indirectly, to companies of the Carrefour group for the above-mentioned purposes as regards the recipients of the data. 78. The restricted session recalls that the information presented was intended for all users of the company's services, who may have very diverse profiles. The company should have adopted a style that could be understood by as many people as possible. The limited session considers that this was not the case here. 79. In general, the restricted formation recalls that the information mentions should be made, as far as possible, using simple vocabulary, short sentences and a direct style, but also avoiding legal or technical terms, abstract or ambiguous terms and formulas such as we could use your data, a possible use of your data, some data concerning you are used, etc. The restricted formation considers that the company should have adopted a style that would allow it to be understood by as many people as possible. 80. Moreover, the restricted session notes that, despite the very large amount of information communicated, it was neither hierarchical nor ordered. The information took the form of a long list of the various points of the Regulation. It considers that such a presentation does not allow the persons concerned to easily find the information they are looking for, forcing them to read all the information mentions. The Commission is therefore of the view that the format used did not meet the accessibility requirement of section 12 of the Regulation, as informed by the transparency guidelines already cited. 81. The restricted panel notes that the combination of sections 12 and 13 of the Regulation requires the data controller to ensure that the information provided is both complete and easily understandable. This balance may be difficult to achieve when, as in the present case, the data processed, the purposes pursued and the retention periods are numerous and different. Nevertheless, the Commission considers that the quality of the information provided is central to the decision of data subjects to enter into a commercial relationship. In this respect, the restricted formation considers that the company should have paid particular attention to the information communicated and should have achieved, even before the controls were carried out, a result that was more readable for the individuals. 2. With regard to the content of the information 82. The rapporteur considers that the information communicated to individuals is incomplete in several respects. 83. Firstly, he states that the data controller is not correctly identified on the carrefour.fr website. 84. Secondly, the rapporteur points out that the legal basis of the processing operations is not indicated, since the company merely states that personal data may be processed on the basis of the user's consent, the performance of the contract or the legitimate interest of the controller, without further clarification. 85. Thirdly, the rapporteur considers that the information on the countries to which the data may be transferred is not complete, as the guarantees surrounding the transfer are not specified, nor is the means of obtaining a copy of these guarantees. 86. Fourthly, he considers that individuals are not informed, in respect of all their data, of the length of time for which it may be retained. 87. On all of these points, the company has indicated that it has made changes prior and subsequent to the notification of the report to bring it into compliance. It stated that, on the day of the audits, it provided full information on several points, including the contact details of its data protection officer, the recipients of the data and the existence of rights. On the points on which it acknowledges the inadequacy of the information it provided, it states that it has modified its information in accordance with the rapporteur's requests during the procedure, in particular as regards the identity of the controller, the purposes and legal basis of the processing operations carried out, the storage periods and the transfer of personal data outside the European Union. 88. On the first point, it emerges from the findings of the delegation of control that the company CARREFOUR HYPERMARCHÉS was indicated as being responsible for the processing implemented through the carrefour.fr website. The companies CARREFOUR HYPERMARCHÉS, CARREFOUR SUPERMARCHÉS FRANCE, CARREFOUR PROXIMITÉ FRANCE, CARREFOUR DRIVE and OOSHOP were designated in the information mentions as joint data controllers for the loyalty program. 89. The restricted session considers, on the first point, that the responsibility for processing implemented from the carrefour.fr site lies with the company CARREFOUR FRANCE, which alone determines the marketing policy common to all formats of the stores in France. This interpretation is consistent with the analysis of the company CARREFOUR FRANCE, which also considers itself responsible for processing as it indicated to the delegation of control on May 28, 2019. 90. Consequently, the restricted formation considers that the mentions made on the carrefour.fr site as in the general conditions of use of the Carrefour card were erroneous. 91. On the second point, the restricted session recalls that the persons concerned must be informed of the legal basis of the processing operation(s) implemented. This requirement cannot be satisfied by the sole reference made to the existing legal bases when several processing operations are implemented. In this case, the persons concerned are not in fact informed of the legal basis applicable to each of the processing operations carried out. 92. The restricted session considers that the indication of the legal basis applicable to each processing operation is of particular importance. On the one hand, it allows the data subject to have an overall appreciation of the processing carried out, in particular its origin. The data subject must therefore be able to know whether the data are processed on the basis of the consent he or she has given (and could therefore withdraw), or on the basis of a contract he or she has entered into with the data controller, or on the basis of a legal obligation on the part of the latter, or on the basis of his or her legitimate interest. On the other hand, and most importantly, the applicable legal basis may have direct consequences on the rights of individuals. For example, Article 20 of the GDMP provides that the right to data portability applies when the processing is based on consent. Therefore, the company had the obligation to specify the legal basis applicable to each processing operation carried out. 93. Due to the absence of such specifications, the restricted formation considers that the mentions made on the carrefour.fr site were incomplete. 94. On the third point, the restricted session emphasizes that Article 13 of the Regulation requires, in point 1.f), that the controller must inform the data subject of the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission or, in the case of transfers referred to in Articles 46 or 47, or in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the reference to appropriate or adequate safeguards and the means of obtaining a copy of them or the place where they have been made available . 95. The restricted session notes that this information was not communicated to the persons concerned at the time of the findings made by the delegation of control. The restricted session considers that the information provided on the carrefour.fr website was incomplete. 96. On the fourth point, the restricted session notes that Article 13-2-a) of the Regulation requires that persons be informed of the duration of the storage of personal data or, when this is not possible, the criteria used to determine this duration. The Guidelines on Transparency, in order to clarify the provisions of Article 13, specify that the retention period (or the criteria for determining it) \[...\] should be formulated in such a way that the data subject can assess \[...\] what the retention period will be in the case of specific data or for specific purposes. The restricted session notes that the information mentions did not indicate the retention periods (or the criteria used to establish them) in a systematic way for all data or purposes, such as navigation data or data relating to purchases made. As a result, individuals were unable to estimate, for many data, the retention periods established by the data controller. 97. Due to the absence of such details, the restricted session considers that the mentions made on the carrefour.fr site were incomplete. 98. It emerges from all of these elements that the information communicated to individuals through the carrefour.fr site and through the paper membership forms for the loyalty program was not easily accessible and was incomplete. The Restricted Group therefore considers that a breach of articles 12 and 13 of the RGPD has been established. 99. 99. It nevertheless underlines the important work of compliance carried out by the company with regard to the information mentions present on its website and on its paper forms. She noted that the company's new practices were, on the day of the meeting, in compliance with the Regulations. The company now provides clear, transparent, easily accessible and complete information on all its media. D. On the breach of access rights 100. Article 15 of the RGPD provides that data subjects have the right to obtain confirmation from the data controller that personal data concerning them are being processed, as well as a certain amount of information, including any available information as to the origin of the data, when the data are not collected directly by the data controller (Article 15-1-g). 101. In referral no. 19001627 of January 21, 2019, Mr \[...\] explained that on November 8, 2018, he had received an electronic prospecting letter without having communicated his contact details to the CARREFOUR group in the past. He stated that he had requested the same day the origin of the personal data concerning him held by the company. On November 15, 2018, the company replied to him in order to obtain a copy of the complainant's identity document, which was communicated to the data controller on November 21. Mr. \[...\] explained that, despite several reminders on January 4 and 18, 2019, no response was given to his request, only his opposition to receive canvassing having been taken into account. 102. It appears from the findings made on June 12, 2019 that this complainant was a former customer of the company OOSHOP, whose site was subsequently integrated into the site carrefour.fr. 103. The company CARREFOUR FRANCE acknowledges that it did not initially communicate to the complainant the origin of the data that it held concerning him, considering that it processed this personal data within the framework of a direct, and not indirect, collection, and that the origin of the data is among the information that must be communicated on the basis of Article 15 of the Rules only in the case of indirect collection of personal data. 104. On this point, the restricted session notes that the complainant had previously created an account on the ooshop website. It is on this occasion that the personal data concerning him had been collected by the company OOSHOP. The restricted session considers that the subsequent merger between the ooshop web site and the carrefour.fr web site does not give the CARREFOUR FRANCE company the quality of first collector of personal data. Indeed, the personal data were transmitted to the company CARREFOUR FRANCE by the company OOSHOP, which corresponds to the case of indirect collection, the data not having been collected by CARREFOUR FRANCE from the person concerned. Consequently, the restricted session considers that CARREFOUR FRANCE was obliged to inform the complainant of the origin of the data in the context of his request for access, in accordance with article 15-1-g) of the RGPD. 105. The restricted session recalls that the fact that the complainant was informed of the merger between the ooshop site and the carrefour.fr site prior to his request to the company did not exempt the data controller from his obligation to inform the complainant of the origin of the data, formulated by the complainant in the context of the exercise of his rights. 106. It follows from these elements that a breach of Article 15 of the Regulations has been established. 107. However, the restricted session emphasizes that the company granted the complainant's request on June 19, 2019, after the audit was carried out but before the initiation of the sanction procedure, and that the breach was therefore no longer constituted on the day of the session. E. On the breach relating to the right to erasure 108. Article 17 of the Regulation defines the conditions under which data subjects are entitled to have their personal data erased. Article 17-1-c), in particular, provides this right when the data is no longer necessary for the purposes of processing or when the person objects to the processing implemented for prospecting purposes. 109. The Commission has received several complaints concerning the difficulties encountered in the exercise of this right. 110. By referral no. 18011774 of June 8, 2018, Mr. \[...\] referred the matter to the CNIL, explaining that he had requested the deletion of his data without obtaining a favorable response to his request, which concerned in particular the deletion of his e-mail address, used by the company for commercial prospecting purposes. 111. The findings made during the audit of June 12, 2019 revealed the presence of the complainant's e-mail address in the company's databases. 112. In defence, the company explained that the e-mail address serves as an entry key to the database in question and therefore cannot be deleted. It further stated that the situation did not result in any prejudice to the complainant, as his opposition to the prospecting had been taken into account. 113. The restricted session first of all emphasizes that the request for deletion of Mr. \[...\] of May 28, 2018 was broad and explicit: I ask you to delete all data you may have on me. These data will be attached to the email address \[...\]@\[...\].com. 114. The restricted session notes that the company has chosen to use as the entry key to its database the e-mail addresses of individuals, thus personal data. This purely practical decision, without the retention of the data in question being justified by any legitimate purpose with regard to the elements of the file, cannot allow it to be exempted from its obligations to exercise its rights. The restricted session considers that Mr. \[...\] could legitimately, on the basis of Article 17-1 c) of the Regulation, require the deletion of his data used for commercial prospecting purposes and it was therefore up to the Company to accede to this request and to set up a system for organizing its database that did not infringe this right. In the present case, the restricted session notes that the Company did not comply with its obligations under Article 17 of the Regulation. 115. The restricted session nevertheless observes that the company modified the architecture of its databases after the notification of the sanction report. The new mode of operation no longer uses personal data as an entry key to the database, and the request made by Mr \[...\] was granted. 116. By referral no. 18013824 of July 7, 2018, Mrs. \[...\] referred the matter to the CNIL, explaining that she had asked the company to delete all personal data concerning her without obtaining a favorable response to her request. 117. The findings made during the audit revealed the presence of the complainant's surname, first name, date of birth and cell phone number in the company's databases. 118. In defence, the company explained that the presence of these data was the result of a one-time error and that it had not led to any consequences for the complainant, as her opposition to receiving commercial prospecting had been taken into account. 119. The restricted session considers that Ms. \[...\] could legitimately, on the basis of article 17-1 c) of the Regulation, require the erasure of her data used for the purposes of commercial prospecting. This constitutes a breach of Article 17 of the Regulation. 120. The restricted session notes, however, that the Company granted Ms. \[...\]'s request on May 12, 2020. 121. By referral no. 19001602 of January 19, 2019, Mr. \[...\] referred the matter to the CNIL, explaining that he had twice requested the deletion of his data and nevertheless continued to receive commercial prospecting. 122. The findings made during the audit revealed the presence of the complainant's surname, first name, date of birth and postal and e-mail addresses in the company's databases. 123. The company explains that the data collected was not included in a database used for commercial prospecting. It argues that, in the event of an objection to the prospecting, it grants the request but does not erase the data from the databases that are not dedicated to prospecting. 124. The restricted session notes that Mr. \[...\]'s request \[...\], concerning the cessation of commercial prospecting and the deletion of data, was unambiguous. In a first e-mail addressed to the company, the complainant explained I wish to obtain the closure of my account thus in accordance with articles 38 and following of the amended law on information technology and civil liberties of January 6, 1978, I thank you for deleting all my personal data attached to this account. In a second letter, he specified Thus, I reiterate my request: pursuant to Articles 21.1 and 17.1.c of the General Regulations on Data Protection (RGPD), I thank you to delete my personal data on the following sites: carrefour.fr and courses-en-ligne.carrefour.fr . Mr. \[...\] being entitled to request such deletion on the basis of Article 17-1 c), it was up to the company, unless justified by the latter to keep the data for a legitimate purpose, to grant this request. A breach of Article 17 of the Regulation is therefore constituted. 125. The restricted session nevertheless notes that, while contesting the assessment of the rapporteur, the company granted the request of Mr. \[...\] and proceeded to erase all data concerning him. 126. By referral no. 19006872 of April 6, 2019, Mr. \[...\] referred the matter to the CNIL, explaining that he had asked the company to erase his postal address without obtaining a favorable response to his request. 127. The findings made during the audit revealed the presence of the name, first name, date of birth, fixed and mobile telephone numbers and postal and electronic addresses of the complainant in the company's databases. 128. 128. The company explains that the presence of the complainant's postal address was the result of a one-off error and did not lead to any consequences, as his opposition to receiving commercial canvassing was taken into account. 129. The restricted session considers that Mr. \[...\] could legitimately, on the basis of article 17-1 c) of the Regulation, require the erasure of his data. A breach of section 17 of the Regulation is therefore constituted. 130. The restricted session nevertheless notes that the Company rectified its error as soon as it was informed of it, following the audit carried out on June 11, 2019. 131. In conclusion, the restricted session considers that if, following a request for deletion, certain personal data of customers may be retained, in particular in accordance with legal obligations or for evidentiary purposes or where the company has a compelling legitimate reason, personal data not necessary in the context of compliance with these other obligations or purposes must be deleted after the exercise of this right as soon as the conditions laid down in Article 17 of the GDR are met. It notes in this respect that this was the case for the processing for the purpose of canvassing and that it does not appear from the elements of the procedure that the retention of the data in question was legitimate on any other basis. 132. Moreover, the restricted session reminds that the data controller has the obligation to contact the data subject when it considers that the requests it receives do not contain all the elements that would enable it to carry out the operations requested of it (Article 142 of Decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 implementing Law no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 relating to data processing, data files and liberties, formerly Article 94 of Decree no. 2005-1309 of October 20, 2005). Consequently, the restricted session considers that if CARREFOUR FRANCE considered that the requests for erasure were too broad and that it could not grant them on the basis of an overriding legitimate interest or because erasure was not possible on the basis of article 17 of the RGPD, it was incumbent on it to take the attachment of the persons concerned, which it did not do in this case. 133. Consequently, in each of the above-mentioned cases, the company did not comply with its obligations under Article 17 of the Regulation and a breach is characterized. F. On the breach relating to the right to object to the processing of personal data for commercial prospecting purposes 134. The second paragraph of Article 21 of the Regulation provides that where personal data are processed for the purposes of canvassing, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning him or her for such purposes. 135. By referral no. 18019816 of October 1, 2018, Mr. \[...\] referred the matter to the CNIL, explaining that he had continued to receive advertising SMS messages from the company despite having previously expressed his opposition to the processing of his personal data for commercial prospecting purposes. 136. The findings made during the audit of June 11, 2019 showed that the complainant's opposition had not been transcribed into the company's databases, thus making it impossible to take it into account. 137. The company explains that this one-off error is due to a shortcoming on the part of its service provider, which had not forwarded the objection in question to it. 138. The restricted session notes that it appears from the findings of the audit, as well as from the documents communicated by the company, that the service provider \[...\] communicates to the company the objections expressed by the persons in the course of the audit .... These transmissions are also compiled in a monthly mailing, which is the only one taken into account by the company in order to transcribe the objections into a database, as it indicated during the procedure. It appears from the documents provided by the Company during the proceedings that Mr. \[...\]'s objection had not been transmitted in a mailing compiled on the day of the audit, June 11, 2019. However, the restricted session emphasizes that the company had received this opposition in the context of the run-of-river transmission and that it should therefore have stopped all commercial prospecting towards the complainant. In any event, the delegation noted that this opposition had not been taken into account on the day of the inspection. 139. Consequently, a breach of Article 21 of the Regulation is constituted. 140. The restricted session nevertheless notes that this error was corrected by the company during the audit carried out on June 11, 2019. It emphasizes above all that the Company has deployed significant resources to review in depth the impact of the objections expressed by SMS in its databases in the context of the present proceedings. It notes that objections are now received directly, processed and transcribed into the database, ensuring better respect of rights. 141. By referral No. 18023308 of November 22, 2018, Mr. \[...\] referred the matter to the CNIL, explaining that he continued to receive advertising SMS messages from the company despite several oppositions previously expressed. 142. The findings made during the audit found that the complainant's opposition had not been transcribed in the company's databases. 143. The company explains that this absence of transcription was due to internal human error. 144. Accordingly, the restricted session considered that the company had not complied with its obligations under section 21 of the Regulation. 145. It notes, however, that the complainant's opposition was taken into account and transcribed into the database during the audit carried out on June 11, 2019. 146. In conclusion on these breaches, the restricted session considers that in each of the above-mentioned cases, the company did not comply with its obligations under Article 21 of the Regulation and that a breach was characterised on the day of the inspection since, although it had offered the persons concerned a means of exercising their right of opposition, this was not systematically taken into account. However, it emphasizes that all of the complaints were handled by the company in the course of the procedure, either immediately during the inspections or following its discussions with the rapporteur. G. On the breach of the right to object to electronic prospecting 147. The first paragraph of Article L34-5 of the French Post and Electronic Communications Code provides that direct canvassing by means of an automated electronic communications system within the meaning of Article L. 32 (6), a fax machine or electronic mail using the contact details of a natural person, subscriber or user, who has not previously expressed his consent to receive direct canvassing by this means, is prohibited. However, the fourth paragraph of the same article sets out an exception to this principle of prohibition if the recipient's contact details have been collected from him, in compliance with the provisions of Law No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 relating to data processing, data files and liberties, on the occasion of a sale or provision of services, if the direct canvassing concerns similar products or services provided by the same natural or legal person, and if the addressee is offered, in an express and unambiguous manner, the possibility to object, free of charge, except for those related to the transmission of the refusal, and in a simple manner, to the use of his contact information at the time they are collected and each time a canvassing e-mail is sent to him in case he has not immediately refused such use. 148. By referral no. 19000325 of January 4, 2019, Mr. \[...\] referred the matter to the CNIL, explaining that he had received commercial canvassing without the e-mail allowing him to oppose it. Indeed, the unsubscribe link of the mailing list sent him back, in order to be able to oppose, to a page of connection to a customer account. However, the complainant did not have such an account, and therefore could not oppose the commercial prospecting. 149. The rapporteur considers that the company failed to fulfil its obligations under Article L.34-5 of the French Post and Electronic Communications Code since it did not systematically offer the recipients of its canvassing e-mails a simple and effective means of unsubscribing from the e-mails in question. The Company acknowledges this error but considers that a breach cannot be characterized on the basis of this single occurrence. 151. It appears from the explanations provided by the company during the audit carried out on July 11, 2019 that such an error did indeed occur in a prospecting e-mail sent to more than 350,000 people. The company indicates that the unsubscribe link included in the prospecting e-mail referred to the personal space of the carrefour.fr site allowing people with a customer account to unsubscribe. By mistake, people without a customer account were targeted by this prospecting campaign. When these people clicked on the unsubscription link, they were asked, in order to unsubscribe, to connect to a customer account they did not have. 152. The company explains that it immediately spotted the error because it had received a large number of complaints from customers who could not properly exercise their rights. It therefore claims that this error occurred only once, since it has not received any other similar complaints. 153. The restricted session considers that persons without a customer account could not simply object to the use of their personal data for commercial prospecting purposes. Consequently, a breach of Article L.34-5 of the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code is constituted when no means of opposing prospecting by electronic means has been offered to these persons. 154. The restricted session nevertheless points out that the company has set up a unique unsubscription link that does not require a customer account to unsubscribe. It therefore believes that the company has implemented the necessary measures to ensure that the rights of individuals are respected in the future. H. On the breach relating to the security of personal data 155. Article 32 of the RGPD provides that the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. 156. The rapporteur criticises the company for not having put in place the necessary measures to protect the personal data it processes after becoming aware of the existence of a vulnerability on its website. 157. It emerges from the company's statements made during the audit of July 11, 2019 that, when a purchase is made on the carrefour.fr website, an invoice is made available to the customer on his personal space after delivery of the order or collection in the store. This invoice is accessible through a fixed URL address. Any person with this address can access the invoice issued without the need to authenticate and connect to his customer area. 158. The Company identified this technical vulnerability on November 16, 2018, recorded in the security incident log under number 415342. To address this vulnerability, the company decided to develop two measures: the addition of a random character string and a mandatory pre-authentication mechanism. The first measure, by increasing the number of potential URLs, was intended to reduce the risk of an incremental address deduction to access invoices. The second measure completely prevented access to the invoices by anyone other than the person concerned. 159. The first measure was implemented very quickly by the company. On the day of the audit, almost eight months after the vulnerability was discovered, the second measure had still not been deployed, and access to an invoice was still possible by anyone with a URL address. 160. On this point, the Company states that, on the day of the audit, it had already deployed a sufficient first measure that significantly reduced the risk of access to documents, and that the second measure was in the process of being deployed. 161. The restricted session considers that the addition of a random character string alone is not sufficient to prevent undue access to the personal data of third parties. This measure reduces the risk but does not eliminate it, as access remains possible. It recalls that the French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) has been warning of this vulnerability linked to URL addresses since 2013, even in the case of URLs composed of several dozen perfectly random characters (Recommendations for the Security of Websites, 13 August 2013, p. 16). The restricted session emphasizes that the company had identified the appropriate measure to be implemented as early as November 2018, since it had planned, as of that date, the deployment of mandatory prior authentication. 162. Accordingly, the restricted session considers that the failure to implement mandatory pre-authentication following the discovery of the vulnerability - when this measure had been identified and is the only measure to completely prevent the risk - constitutes a breach of section 32 of the Regulation. 163. The restricted session notes, however, that the company implemented mandatory authentication on July 17, 2019. I. On the breach relating to the notification of personal data breaches 164. Article 33 of the Regulation provides that in the event of a breach of personal data, the controller shall notify the competent supervisory authority in accordance with Article 55 as soon as possible and, if possible, no later than 72 hours after becoming aware of the breach, unless the breach is unlikely to jeopardize the rights and freedoms of natural persons. 165. The rapporteur considers that the company has failed in its obligation to notify personal data breaches, as this obligation is apparent from the circumstances of the breach and the data concerned. 166. The findings of the July 11, 2019 audit show that the company identified and recorded a computer attack on July 1, 2019. This attack, using the group's mobile application authentication service, took the form of 800,000 connection attempts from 10,000 IP addresses. It resulted in 4,000 successful authentications and 275 effective accesses to customer accounts. This violation was not notified to the CNIL. 167 In defence, the company indicated that the violation was unlikely to create a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. It also stated that the persons concerned suffered no financial loss since no loyalty points were subtracted. It stresses that in any event, the general conditions of use of the Carrefour card provide for the reimbursement of the jackpot of the persons concerned in the event of an attack by third parties. 168. The restricted session recalls that in the event of a breach of personal data, the principle is that of notification to the supervisory authority. The absence of notification is only possible by way of exception, when the violation is not likely to create a risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals. In the present case, the restricted session considers that the analysis of the risks linked to this violation does not lead to the application of this exception to the obligation of notification. Indeed, the seriousness of the violation stems from the obviously malicious origin of this attack, the large number of persons concerned and the combination of several personal data to which the attack gave access and which allow for the identification and direct contact of the persons concerned (customer accounts may include, in particular, the identity of the persons, their telephone number, their e-mail address and their physical address). 169. The restricted session notes that the 4,000 accounts for which no effective access has been found but which have been successfully authenticated should be regarded as participating in the risk assessment. Indeed, the restricted session points out that many people use the same combination of email address and password on a very large number of websites. There is therefore a serious risk that attackers who have identified a valid email address/password combination will try to reuse it on other websites (a technique called credential stuffing). There was also a risk that, now having several pieces of information about the persons concerned and their relations with the companies of the Carrefour group, the attackers would try to usurp the identity of one of these companies in malicious and misleading e-mails (phishing). These accounts must therefore be considered as concerned by the violation. 170 Accordingly, the restricted session considers that a violation of section 33 of the GDMP is constituted. 171 It nevertheless stresses that, despite a difference of appreciation with the rapporteur and with a view to compliance, the company notified the violation to the CNIL on July 19, 2020 and was thus in compliance on the day of the meeting. J. On the breach relating to cookies 172. Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act (Article 32.II in a wording identical to the day of the findings) requires that users be informed and that their consent be obtained before any operation of access or registration to information already stored in its equipment. Any deposit of cookies or other tracers must therefore be preceded by the information and consent of individuals. This requirement does not apply to cookies whose sole purpose is to enable or facilitate communication by electronic means or which are strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user . 173. The rapporteur considers that the company did not comply with these provisions since it emerges from the online control of May 24, 2019 that when arriving on the carrefour.fr website, several cookies that do not fit into the two cases mentioned above were deposited on the user's terminal as soon as he connects to the home page of the site and before any action on his part. 174. The company does not dispute these elements. 175. The restricted session notes that in the case in point, the deposit of thirty-nine cookies was automatic upon arrival on the home page of the site, and before any action by the user. Of these thirty-nine cookies, three belonged to the Google Analytics solution (cookies \_gid , \_ga and \_gat\_gtag\_UA\_3928615\_46 ). 176. With regard to these three cookies, known as Google analytics, the restricted session emphasizes that there is no debate that the data collected by these cookies can be cross-referenced with data from other treatments to pursue purposes other than those restrictively provided for in Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, including to carry out personalized advertising. Indeed, it emerges from the practical guide Association of Analytics accounts and Google Ads, posted on one of Google's sites, that the integration of Google Analytics in Google Ads (...) allows \[advertisers\] to know precisely to what extent \[their\] ads result in conversions, then quickly adjust the creations and bids accordingly. Advertisers can\] also combine products to identify \[their\] most interesting segments and then engage these users with personalized messages. 177. Accordingly, these cookies are not intended solely to enable or facilitate electronic communication and are not strictly necessary for the provision of the Service. Their deposit should therefore have required the company to obtain the prior consent of users. 178. The restricted session considers, therefore, that a breach of article 82 of law no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 is constituted. It also considers that this breach concerned a large number of people, namely all visitors to the carrefour.fr site. 179. The restricted session nevertheless stresses that the company made significant changes to its website during the sanction proceedings. These modifications led, in particular, to the cessation of the automatic deposit of cookies on arrival on the home page of the site since February 5, 2020. III. On corrective measures and advertising 180. Under the terms of III of article 20 of the law of January 6, 1978: When the data controller or its processor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or the present law, the president of the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties may also, if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of the present article or, if necessary in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted session of the commission with a view to the pronouncement, after an adversarial procedure, of one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 7° Except in cases where the treatment is implemented by the State, an administrative fine may not exceed 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the total annual worldwide turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher. In the cases referred to in Article 83 (5) and (6) of EU Regulation 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased to 20 million euros and 4% of said revenue, respectively. The restricted session takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same Article 83. 181. Article 83 of the RGPD provides : 1. Each control authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this Article for violations of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 2. 2. Depending on the specific features of each case, administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). In deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the amount of the administrative fine, due account shall be taken, in each individual case, of the following elements : a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the violation, taking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage they have suffered ; (b) whether the breach was committed intentionally or through negligence ; (c) any measure taken by the controller or the processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects ; (d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical and organisational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32; (e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or processor ; (f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach and mitigating its possible negative effects ; (g) the categories of personal data concerned by the breach; (h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether and to what extent the controller or processor notified the breach ; (i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the same purpose, compliance with those measures ; (j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or certification schemes approved pursuant to Article 42; and (k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstances applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, as a result of the violation. 182. With respect to injunctions and compliance, the restricted session noted that the company corrected all of the deficiencies identified in the sanction report during the proceeding. As compliance has been demonstrated to date, the restricted session considers that no injunction is warranted. 183. As regards the imposition of a fine and its amount, the restricted session considers that, in the case in point, the aforementioned breaches justify the imposition of an administrative fine on the company. 184. As regards the fine proposed by the rapporteur, the company first of all argues that the amount of the proposed fine is excessive, as several breaches are, in its view, not constituted. On this point, the restricted session considers that all the breaches noted by the rapporteur are characterized in this case, as it detailed previously in the reasons for the decision. 185. The company then argues that the mitigating factors set out in section 83 of the Regulation should lead to a reduction in the amount proposed by the rapporteur and that the significant compliance work carried out should be taken into account. 186. The restricted session analyzes the criteria set out in Section 83 as follows. 187. With regard to the nature, seriousness and duration of the breach, it considers that this criterion is particularly characterized for several breaches, in particular those relating to the duration of the storage of personal data, the modalities of exercising rights and the deposit of cookies. With regard to the breach relating to the right to erasure and opposition to prospecting, the restricted session notes the residual nature of these cases in view of the large number of requests for erasure that the data controller has faced since the application of the RGPD. It stresses that the number of complaints received by the Commission is limited and is the result of isolated failures on each occasion. She acknowledges the changes made by the company to comply on this point as well as to internalize the consideration of individuals' opposition and improve the processing of requests and respect for rights. With respect to the data security breach, the restricted session believes that the seriousness of this breach is mitigated by the prompt implementation of measures that partially limit the occurrence of the risk. Finally, with respect to the opposition to electronic prospecting, the restricted session notes that the incident was a one-time incident. Regarding the number of people concerned, this criterion is particularly aggravating for the failure relating to the length of time data is kept, which affected several million people, for information, since every person who joined the loyalty program or created an account on the carrefour.fr site was concerned, and for the failure relating to cookies, since cookies were deposited without consent on the terminal of the site's 1.7 million unique visitors. This criterion is, however, mitigating with regard to the difficulties encountered in exercising the right of access (three persons concerned), the right to erase data (four persons concerned), the right to object (two persons concerned) and the opposition to electronic prospecting (350 persons concerned out of the 350,000 people targeted by the campaign). Of all the breaches, the restricted session considers the level of damage suffered to be insignificant. 188. The restricted session notes that most breaches are the result of negligence, one-off errors or a lack of anticipation of the consequences of the application of the Regulations. 189. With regard to the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the harm suffered by data subjects, the restricted session notes the company's perfect cooperation throughout the sanction procedure and the very significant efforts made to achieve full compliance on the day of the session. It notes that all breaches have been corrected to date. 190. With regard to the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority, the restricted session noted the company's perfect cooperation, both in facilitating the CNIL's investigations and in taking into account the rapporteur's observations, even before the restricted session's decision. It also notes that the company complied with the rapporteur's legal analysis of all the shortcomings noted, even in cases where a difference of opinion remained. 191. With regard to the categories of personal data concerned, the restricted session notes that no sensitive data were concerned by the processing operations. 192. With regard to the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, the restricted session notes that complaints were the source of many of the breaches. 193. 193. With respect to the benefits derived from the breaches, the restricted session believes that the company did not receive any financial benefit from the breaches. In particular, it demonstrated that even when the retention periods were exceeded, the data could not be used for prospecting purposes. In addition, it has committed significant financial resources to comply during the sanction procedure. 194. In conclusion, the restricted session raises the number and seriousness of breaches of certain essential obligations of a data controller, such as information or respect for the rights of individuals. It also notes that some failures were structural. This was the case, for example, of the undersizing of the means used to respond to requests to exercise rights, leading on a recurring basis to abnormally long response times without individuals being informed of the processing of their request, or the delay in the purging of personal data whose storage period had expired. On these points, the restricted session also highlights the particularly large number of people involved, given the several tens of millions of customers whose personal data is held in the company's databases. Finally, the restricted session notes that the breaches were brought to its attention due to a large number of complaints received by the CNIL concerning this data controller. This large volume of complaints is moreover at the origin of the decision to carry out an audit against this company. 195. Consequently, the restricted session considers that a fine should be imposed. 196. With regard to the basis for the fine, the company also disputes the method of calculating the basis for the penalty. 197. On this point, the restricted session points out that article 83-5 of the Regulation provides that the amount of fines imposed for breaches of the rules may amount to up to 4 per cent of the total annual worldwide turnover of the previous financial year. It points out that recital 150 of the Regulation specifies that when administrative fines are imposed on an undertaking, the term ""undertaking"" should, for this purpose, be understood as an undertaking in accordance with Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union . The restricted session therefore considers that the Regulation makes a direct and explicit reference, in the particular context of the determination of the amount of fines, to the competition law as it relates to Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereinafter the TFEU ). The restricted session recalls that the Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679, adopted on 3 October 2017 by the G29, specify in this respect that in order to impose effective, proportionate and dissuasive fines, the supervisory authorities will rely on the definition of the concept of undertaking provided by the CJEU for the purposes of the application of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, i.e. the concept of undertaking must be understood as an economic unit which may be formed by the parent company and all the subsidiaries concerned. In accordance with Union law and case-law, an undertaking is to be understood as the economic unit engaged in commercial or economic activities, irrespective of the legal person involved (recital 150). 198. The restricted session considers that the subsidiaries owned by the company CARREFOUR FRANCE and benefiting from the processing operations must be considered as concerned within the meaning of the above-mentioned guidelines. Indeed, in the context of competition law, to which recital 150 of the Regulation refers directly, an undertaking must be understood as designating an economic unit even if, from a legal point of view, this economic unit is made up of several natural or legal persons (judgment of 12 July 1984, Hydrotherm, 170/83, ECR p. 2999, point 11, reproduced in the judgment of the Confederación Española de Empresarios de Estaciones de Servicio, ECLI:EU:C:2006:784, point 40). 199. The restricted session also recalls that the fines imposed must have a deterrent effect. In the light of this requirement, it has been held that imputation of liability to the economic successor is justified for the purposes of the effective implementation of the competition rules. Indeed, if the Commission did not have such an option, it would be easy for companies to escape sanctions through restructuring, divestitures or other legal or organizational changes. The objective of repressing conduct contrary to the rules of competition and preventing the renewal of such conduct by means of dissuasive sanctions would thus be compromised (Trib. EU, February 29, 2016, Schenker v. European Commission, Case T-265/12, paragraph 193). 200. The restricted session considers that the legal organization of the group, and in particular that of CARREFOUR FRANCE and its subsidiaries, would de facto render ineffective any fine that would be imposed on the turnover of CARREFOUR FRANCE alone. The restricted session reminds that CARREFOUR FRANCE had revenues of approximately 14 million euros and a net loss of 1.6 billion euros in 2019. These figures were of the same order in 2018 (sales of around 25 million euros and a net loss of 1.4 billion euros). However, CARREFOUR FRANCE belongs to a group whose economic activity is of a totally different order of magnitude, with revenues of approximately 80 billion euros (approximately 40 billion euros in France) for an adjusted net profit, group share, of approximately 900 million euros in 2019. Certain subsidiaries of CARREFOUR FRANCE generate particularly high revenues. For example, CARREFOUR HYPERMARKETS (81.73% owned by CARREFOUR FRANCE) generated revenues of 14.3 billion euros in 2019 and CARREFOUR PROXIMITÉ FRANCE (99% owned by CARREFOUR FRANCE) generated revenues of 636 million euros in 2019. 201. Consequently, the restricted session considers that, in order to assess the concept of an enterprise in accordance with Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU, it is necessary to take into account the turnover generated by CARREFOUR FRANCE and by the subsidiaries it owns and which have benefited from the treatments. It emerges from the company's declarations during the audit carried out on May 28, 2019 that CARREFOUR HYPERMARKETS and CARREFOUR PROXIMITÉ FRANCE benefit from the data pooling program. The French Marketing Department of CARREFOUR FRANCE processes the shared data of the customers of these companies (surname, first name, physical and electronic address, telephone number, purchase history) in order to send them personalized advertising for the products sold in these brands. The restricted session also emphasizes that these companies participate in the collection of personal data, since membership in the loyalty program is possible directly in the store through paper forms. 202. In conclusion, the restricted session notes that the turnover of the company, in the sense of an economic unit, serving as a basis for calculating the basis of the fine amounts to EUR 14.9 billion in 2019. 203. The restricted session considers, however, that the determination of the amount of the fine must take account of the specific nature of the economic model of the sector concerned, that of mass retailing, which is characterized by a particularly high turnover in relation to the net results generated by the activity, which is characterized by extremely high volumes and low margins. 204. 2,250,000 is justified and proportionate to the breaches identified and to the situation of CARREFOUR FRANCE. 205. On the publicity of the decision, the company considers that the publicity of the penalty is not justified. 206. The restricted session considers, first, that the seriousness of certain breaches justifies, in itself, the publicity of the present decision. 207. The restricted session recalls, secondly, that the breaches relating to the duration of data retention, the methods of exercising rights or the information provided concerned a very large number of persons. It considers that the publicity of its decision is the best means of informing people of the past existence of these failures. It notes that individuals can only become aware of certain breaches (such as the one relating to the retention period) through the publication of its decision. 208. It follows from all of the foregoing and taking into account the criteria set out in Article 83 of the Regulation that an administrative fine of EUR 2,250,000 and an additional publication penalty for a period of two years are justified and proportionate.

The CARREFOUR BANQUE company having spoken last; The restricted committee adopted the following decision: I. Facts and procedure 1. CARREFOUR BANQUE is a subsidiary 40% owned by BNP PARIBAS SA and 60% by CARREFOUR SA, parent company of the CARREFOUR group. 2. Created in 1959, the CARREFOUR group (hereinafter the group), whose head office is at 93 avenue de Paris in Massy (91300), its main activity is mass distribution. He is also involved in other areas such as the banking and insurance sector, e-commerce and travel agencies. In 2018, it employed around 360,000 people and had a turnover of 76 billion euros. 3. Based at 1 place Copernic Courcouronnes in Évry Courcouronnes (91080), the company CARREFOUR BANQUE (hereinafter the company) is a banking establishment whose main activities include consumer credit, portfolio management, insurance brokerage and as investment services. In 2018, it employed around 300 people and achieved n net banking income of 308 million euros . 4. As part of its activities, the company publishes the website www.carrefour-banque.fr (hereinafter the site carrefour-banque.fr). It also markets a payment card intended for customers of the Carrefour group (hereinafter the Pass card), which can be attached to the group's loyalty program. 5. En application des décisions n<sup>o</sup> 2019-081C du 24 avril 2019 et n<sup>o</sup> 2019-102C du 6 juin 2019 de la présidente de la Commission, les services de la CNIL ont procédé à un contrôle en ligne, le 5 juillet 2019, relatif au site carrefour-banque.fr et aux traitements mis en œuvre à partir de ce site ainsi qu’à un contrôle sur place dans les locaux de la société CARREFOUR S.A., le 9 juillet 2019, relatif aux traitements concernant la carte Pass. 6. Ces missions avaient pour objet de vérifier, notamment, le respect, par la société, de l’ensemble des dispositions durèglement (UE) 2016/679 du Parlement européen et du Conseil du 27 avril 2016 (ci-après le Règlement ou le RGPD ) et dela loi n<sup>o</sup> 78-17 du 6 janvier 1978 modifiée relative à l’informatique, aux fichiers et aux libertés (ci-après la loi informatique et libertés ). 7. Dans le cadre du contrôle sur place, les représentants du groupe CARREFOUR ont précisé à la délégation que la société CARREFOUR BANQUE est responsable de traitement des deux programmes paiement (débit et crédit) de la carte Pass tandis que la société CARREFOUR FRANCE est responsable de traitement du troisième programme permettant le rattachement de la carte Pass à la base de données SIEBEL qui met en œuvre le programme de fidélité Carrefour. 8. Le 19 juillet 2019, la société a transmis à la délégation de contrôle les documents demandés dans le cadre du contrôle sur place du 9 juillet 2019 et notamment le comptage du nombre de cartes Pass rattachées au programme de fidélité Carrefour. 9. For the purposes of examining these elements, the Vice-President of the Commission appointed Mr. Éric PÉRÈS as rapporteur, on November 29, 2019, on the basis of Article 22 of the Data Protection Act. 10. At the end of his investigation, the rapporteur had a bailiff served on the company CARREFOUR BANQUE, on January 10, 2020, with a report detailing the breaches of the GDPR and of the Data Protection Act that he considered to be the species. 11. This report proposed to the restricted formation of the Commission to issue an injunction to bring the processing into conformity with the provisions of Articles 5, 12 and 13 of the Regulations and of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, together with a penalty, as well as an administrative fine. He also proposed that this decision be made public and no longer make it possible to identify the company by name after a period of two years from its publication. 12. On January 29, 2020, the company requested a one-month extension of the deadline within which it had to respond to the report, the postponement of the meeting initially scheduled for March 24, 2020 as well as a meeting with the rapporteur. On February 3, the president of the restricted party granted the requested extension for a period of one month. On February 6, the secretary general of the CNIL granted the request to postpone the meeting to April 21, 2020. On the same day, the rapporteur refused the meeting requested by the company. 13. On March 10, 2020, through its counsel, the company filed observations and made a request that the session before the restricted panel be held in camera. 14. By e-mail of 23 March 2020 and on the basis of article 40, paragraph 4, of decree n ° 2019-536 of 29 May 2019, the rapporteur asked the president of the restricted formation for an additional period of fifteen days to respond to comments from the company. 15. By letter of March 24, 2020, taking note in particular of the context of the health crisis, the president of the restricted group granted the rapporteur's request. 16. By letter of the same day, the company was informed of the additional time granted to the rapporteur and of the fact that it had, by virtue of paragraph 5 of article 40 of decree n ° 2019-536 of 29 May 2019, a period of one month to respond to the rapporteur's response. The letter also informed him of the second postponement of the restricted training session, scheduled for April 21, 2020. 17. By e-mail of April 7, 2020, the rapporteur asked the chairman of the restricted party for a new additional period of fifteen days to respond to the company's observations, which was granted to him on April 8, 2020. The company was. informed the same day. 18. Le rapporteur a répondu aux observations de la société le 22 avril 2020. 19. Par un courrier du même jour, le secrétaire général de la CNIL a informé la société qu’elle pouvait transmettre ses observations à la réponse du rapporteur jusqu’au 24 août 2020 en application de l’ordonnance n° 2020-306 du 25 mars 2020 relative à la prorogation des délais échus pendant la période d'urgence sanitaire. 20. Le 30 juin 2020, le président de la formation restreinte a fait droit à la demande de huis clos formulée par la société, au motif que certains éléments versés aux débats étaient protégés par le secret des affaires, tel que prévu par l’article L 151-1 du code du commerce. 21. Le 5 août 2020, les services de la CNIL ont notifié à la société une convocation à la séance de la formation restreinte du 17 septembre 2020. 22. Le 24 août 2020, la société a produit de nouvelles observations en réponse à celles du rapporteur. 23. La société et le rapporteur ont présenté des observations orales lors de la séance de la formation restreinte. II. Motifs de la décision A. Sur le manquement à l’obligation de traiter les données de manière loyale 24. Aux termes de l’article 5, paragraphe 1, a), du RGPD : ''Les données à caractère personnel doivent être: a) traitées de manière licite, loyale et transparente au regard de la personne concernée (licéité, loyauté, transparence)'' . 25. It emerges from the observations made by the delegation of control that when a subscriber of a payment card (Pass card) also wishes to join the Carrefour loyalty program, the company CARREFOUR BANQUE makes several requests to the company CARREFOUR FRANCE including, in particular, a request to join the Carrefour loyalty program. 26. Indeed, during the online check, the delegation noted that if they want to join the Carrefour loyalty program, the Pass card subscriber must in particular tick the box at the bottom of the page entitled My loyalty rewarded with support. which the following statement: ''contains I want to link my Carrefour Loyalty account to my Pass card (or failing that, create and link it). To do this, I accept that Carrefour Banque communicates to Carrefour Fidélité my name, first name and email. Carrefour Banque undertakes not to transmit any other information to Carrefour Fidélité'' . 27. It appears from the documents submitted to the delegation during the on-site inspection that the company CARREFOUR BANQUE also transmits to the company CARREFOUR FRANCE, in addition to the surname, first name and email address of the subscriber of the Pass card mentioned above, his address mailing as well as its telephone number (s). When it has this information, it also informs CARREFOUR FRANCE about the number of children declared by the subscriber. 28. The rapporteur therefore considers that the company breached the principle of loyalty when it transmitted to the company CARREFOUR FRANCE more personal data concerning the subscribers of the Pass card than those exhaustively listed in the context of the subscription process. online. 29. The company replied, first of all, that since the concept of loyalty was not defined in the Rules, the rapporteur could not ask the restricted panel to sanction the violation. 30. It notes, moreover, that the principle of loyalty can at most be linked to the obligation of transparency, provided for in Article 12 of the Rules. In this case, it claims to have complied with this requirement of transparency since the mention of information challenged by the rapporteur informs people of the existence of the processing, its purpose and the transfer of this data. to third parties. 31. It maintains, finally, that the practices complained of could all the less be qualified as unfair as they result only from a failure to update its website, due to a communication error between the various services of the two companies. 32. The restricted committee recalls that the principle of loyalty is an independent principle provided for in Article 5, paragraph 1, a) of the GDPR, the violation of which by a data controller is likely to give rise to the pronouncement of a corrective measure. from the supervisory authority. 33. It notes, in this regard, that this provision must be interpreted in the light of recital 60 of the Regulation, according to which: ''the principle of fair and transparent treatment requires that the data subject be informed of the existence of the transaction processing and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject with any other information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing, taking into account the particular circumstances and the context in which the personal data are processed'' . 34. In this case, the restricted panel considers that the information provided in this reference was both imprecise and misleading. 35. First of all, the restricted committee notes that the CARREFOUR BANQUE company mentions ''Carrefour Fidélité'' as the recipient of the data communicated even though this service, attached to the CARREFOUR FRANCE company, had never before this mention been presented to subscribers. of the Pass card. Thus, the persons concerned could not understand for themselves that their personal data were in fact communicated to a third company, the company CARREFOUR FRANCE. 36. Next, the restricted committee considers that the information provided to the persons concerned was misleading and unfair since the company had expressly indicated, in this same notice of information, that it ''undertakes \[to\] not transmit any other information to Carrefour Fidélité'' than the names, first names and e-mail address of Pass card subscribers even though this was precisely not the case. 37. The restricted panel therefore considers that a breach of Article 5 (1) (a) of the GDPR has occurred. 38. It notes, however, that on the day of the meeting, the company had completely overhauled the online subscription process for the Pass card and, in particular, rewrote the disputed information. Pass card subscribers wishing to be attached to the Carrefour loyalty program are now informed that personal data concerning them is transmitted to the company CARREFOUR FRANCE and are also informed of the exact nature of the data actually transmitted. B. On the failure to inform individuals 39. Article 12 of the Regulation provides that: ''the controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 \[…\] regarding the processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent manner, understandable and easily accessible, in clear and simple terms \[…\]'' . 40. L’article 13 de ce même Règlement dresse la liste des informations devant être communiquées aux personnes concernées lorsque les données à caractère personnel sont collectées auprès d’elles. 1. S’agissant de l’accessibilité de l’information 41. '''En premier lieu''', le rapporteur considère que, tel qu’il ressort des constations effectuées par la délégation lors du contrôle en ligne, l’information mise à disposition des utilisateurs du site carrefour-banque.fr par le biais de différents canaux, n’était pas aisément accessible au sens de l’article 12 du Règlement. 42. To read the information provided regarding the processing of their personal data, the user could first of all click on the tab ''Protection of banking data'' appearing at the footer of the site. Alternatively, he could also click on the link ''Legal notices'' at the foot of the site, go to point 3 of these notices, entitled ''3 - Protection and confidentiality of personal data processed by Carrefour Banque'' and, finally, click on the link ''For more find out more about our personal data protection policy see our dedicated page'' , which referred to the company's confidentiality policy entitled ''Protection and confidentiality of personal data processed by Carrefour Banque'' , without any other information having been previously provided to user before reaching this privacy policy. 43. The company maintains that it was perfectly justified to insert a link to its confidentiality policy in its legal notices and that in any case, this information was provided directly ''via'' the tab ''Protection of banking data'' appearing at the bottom page of the site. 44. The restricted committee recalls that in order to consider that a data controller fulfills his obligation of transparency, the information provided must in particular be ''easily accessible'' to the persons concerned within the meaning of Article 12 of the Regulation. 45. It notes, in this regard, that this provision must be interpreted in the light of recital 61 of the Regulation, according to which: ''information on the processing of personal data relating to the data subject should be provided to him at the time when this data is collected from it'' . 46. ​​In this sense, it shares the position of the G29 presented in the guidelines on transparency within the meaning of the Regulation, adopted in their revised version on 11 April 2018 (hereinafter the guidelines on transparency), which recalls that ''the the person concerned should not have to search for the information but should be able to access it immediately'' . 47. To illustrate how it is possible to meet this accessibility criterion, these same guidelines specify, in the case of an online environment that ''each company with a website should publish a statement or notice on the protection of privacy on its site. A direct link to this privacy statement or notice should be clearly visible on every page of this website under a commonly used term (such as Privacy, Privacy Policy, or Privacy Notice). Text or links whose layout or color choice makes them less visible or difficult to find on a web page are not considered to be easily accessible'' . 48. In the present case, the restricted committee considers, first of all, that the vagueness of the title of the tab ''Protection of banking data'' appearing at the footer of the site, referring to banking data and not personnel, could not allow the persons concerned to easily understand that by clicking on this link they would be redirected to the site's confidentiality policy, including information relating to the processing of their personal data. Indeed, for the general public, a large part of the data processed (address, number of children, etc.) does not come from banking data. 49. Ensuite, s’agissant du second canal d’information, les utilisateurs du site carrefour-banque.fr ne pouvaient deviner d’eux-mêmes que le lien renvoyant vers la politique de confidentialité du site était inséré dans les mentions légales du site. Ainsi, pour parvenir jusqu’à cette politique de confidentialité, les utilisateurs devront, dans un certain nombre de cas, entreprendre préalablement plusieurs actions, comme, par exemple, cliquer sur les liens ''Accessibilité'' ou ''Conditions générales de vente'' figurant également en pied de la page d’accueil, avant de cliquer finalement sur le lien ''Mentions légales'' . 50. Il en résulte que l’information fournie aux utilisateurs du site carrefour-banque.fr n’était pas ''aisément accessible'' . 51. '''En deuxième lieu''', le rapporteur estime que l’information relative à la carte Pass fournie dans le cadre du parcours de souscription en ligne sur le site carrefour-banque.fr et telle que constatée lors du contrôle en ligne n’était pas non plus ''aisément accessible'' dès lors que les souscripteurs de cette carte ne disposaient pas d’une information complète relative au traitement de leurs données sur la page de présentation du parcours de souscription et qu’ils n’étaient pas, non plus, invités à prendre connaissance d’une information plus complète, par exemple par le biais d’un lien hypertexte renvoyant vers des mentions d’information complémentaires. 52. La société soutient qu’un tel lien existait déjà à travers l’onglet ''Protection des données bancaires'' figurant en pied de page du site. 53. The restricted committee emphasizes that according to the principle of transparency, as recalled in particular in recital 61 of the GDPR, information must be communicated to people at the time the data is collected. 54. As an example, the G29 Transparency Guidelines state that, in an online context, ''a link to the privacy statement or notice should be provided at the point of collection of personal data, or that this information can be viewed on the same page as the one where the personal data is collected'' . 55. In the present case, the findings show that the company has chosen to adopt information at several levels. 56. In this regard, if the company did provide, in the presentation page of the Pass card subscription process, the information expected as first-level information, namely the identity of the data controller, the purposes main processing and description of IT rights and Freedoms, the restricted training notes on the other hand that the company had neglected to complete these mentions by allowing people to read complete information by inserting, for example, a hypertext link to second-level information, in this case, to the company's confidentiality policy, which is supposed to detail all of the information required by article 13 of the Regulation. 57. With regard to the tab ''Protection of banking data'' put forward by the company, the restricted committee noted that this tab did not appear at the footer of the online subscription process for the Pass card and recalls that in all its title would not have enabled the people concerned to easily understand that by clicking on this link they would be redirected to the company's confidentiality policy. 58. In this way, the data subjects were not informed, at the time of the collection of their personal data, of all the information relating to the processing. As a result, all the information provided to Pass card subscribers on the carrefour-banque.fr site was not ''easily accessible'' . 59. The Restricted Panel therefore considers that the company disregarded the provisions of Article 12 of the Rules. 60. It notes, however, that on the day of the meeting, the company had completely overhauled its website and that the information provided today both to users of the site and to subscribers of the Pass card now meets the requirements of section 12 of the Regulations. 2. Regarding the content of the information 61. Le rapporteur considère que la politique de confidentialité de la société, intitulée ''Protection et confidentialité des données personnelles traitées par Carrefour Banque'' et accessible selon les modalités rappelées ci-avant, était à la fois imprécise et lacunaire s’agissant des mentions relatives aux durées de conservation. Ainsi, d’une part, la politique d’information comportait des formulations trop vagues, ne permettant pas d’identifier des durées définies et, d’autre part, la société ne donnait aucune information concernant certaines données qu’elle indiquait pourtant collecter, telles que les données de comportement, d’habitudes et de préférences de consommation en ligne collectées par les cookies déposés sur le terminal des utilisateurs à partir de son site web. Par ailleurs, la société ne précisait pas si elle archivait ou non les données des personnes concernées. 62. La société conteste le caractère imprécis de ses mentions d’information relatives aux durées de conservation et fait valoir que l’information relative aux cookies était disponible dans un autre développement de ses ''Mentions légales'' . 63. La formation restreinte rappelle qu’aux termes de l’article 13, paragraphe 2, a) du Règlement, le responsable du traitement fournit à la personne concernée les informations relatives à ''la durée de conservation des données à caractère personnel ou, lorsque ce n'est pas possible, les critères utilisés pour déterminer cette durée'' . 64. By way of clarification, the above transparency guidelines recommend that ''the retention period \[be\] formulated in such a way that the data subject can assess, depending on the situation in which they find themselves, what will be the retention period. retention in the case of specific data or for specific purposes. The controller cannot simply state in general that the personal data will be kept for as long as the legitimate purpose of the processing requires. Where appropriate, different storage periods should be mentioned for the different categories of personal data and / or the different processing purposes, in particular periods for archival purposes'' . 65. In the present case, the restricted panel emphasizes, first of all, that the use of vague and undefined formulas such as ''the applicable legal limitation periods'' or ''the retention of your data by Carrefour Banque varies according to the regulations and laws. applicable'' or even expressions ''by way of example'' or of the adverb in ''particular'' necessarily made it confusing for the persons concerned to understand the extent and nature of the data stored as well as the retention periods applied to this data. 66. It adds, then, that the information was also incomplete insofar as the company neglected to specify the retention periods applicable to all the data processed or did not specify the criteria used to determine these periods. Thus, the company did not specify that it archived contractual data for five years, the period of the applicable legal limitation, in the event of litigation. In addition, it did not specify the retention periods for the data collected by cookies, since if the ''Legal Notice of'' the site did include a paragraph relating to cookies, the latter did not specify the retention periods for the data collected by these cookies. . 67. The restricted panel therefore considers that a breach of article 13 of the Rules had been established. 68. It notes, however, that on the day of the meeting, the company had completed its information notices and that its confidentiality policy now meets the requirements of Article 13 of the Regulation. C. On the breach relating to cookies 69. Article 82 of the Data Protection Act (Article 32.II in a wording identical to the date of the findings) requires that users be informed and that their consent be obtained before any operation to access or register for information already stored in their equipment. Any deposit of cookie or other tracer must therefore be preceded by the information and consent of users. This requirement does not apply to cookies whose ''sole purpose is to allow or facilitate communication by electronic means'' or which are ''strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user'' . 70. Le rapporteur considère que la société ne respectait pas ces dispositions dès lors qu’il a été constaté lors du contrôle en ligne qu’en arrivant sur le site web carrefour-banque.fr, plusieurs cookies ne rentrant pas dans les deux cas rappelés ci-avant étaient déposés sur le terminal de l’utilisateur dès la connexion à la page d’accueil du site et avant toute action de sa part. 71. La société ne conteste pas ces éléments. 72. La formation restreinte relève, en l’espèce, que le dépôt de trente et un cookies était automatique dès l’arrivée sur la page d’accueil du site et avant toute action de l’utilisateur. 73. The Restricted Committee observes that five of these cookies (the ''MUIDB'' , ''GPS'' and ''gid'' , ''\_ga'' and ''\_gat\_trackerBanque cookies'' ) had neither the exclusive purpose of allowing or facilitating electronic communication, nor were they strictly necessary for the provision of a service expressly requested by the user. 74. Regarding, first of all, the three cookies ''gid'' , ''\_ga'' and ''\_gat\_trackerBanque'' , known as ''Google analytics,'' the restricted party emphasizes that there is no debate that the data collected by these cookies can be cross-checked with data from other processing to pursue purposes other than those limited by Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, in particular to carry out personalized advertising. Indeed, it emerges from the practical guide Association of Analytics and Google Ads accounts, posted on one of the sites of the Google company, that ''the integration of Google Analytics in Google Ads (…) allows \[advertisers\] to know precisely in how much \[their\] ads translate to conversions, and then quickly adjust creatives and bids accordingly. \[Advertisers can\] also combine products to identify \[their\] most interesting segments and then engage those users with personalized messages'' . 75. As regards, then, cookies ''MUIDB'' and ''GPS'' , the Restricted Committee notes that these two cookies are tracking cookies, the first allowing a user to be tracked by visiting different domain names belonging to the Microsoft company, the second registering an identifier on the user's terminal in order to geolocate it. Therefore, the deposit of these five cookies should have obliged the company to first obtain the user's consent. 76. The restricted committee therefore considers that a breach of article 82 of the Data Protection Act was established. 77. It notes, however, that on the day of the meeting, the company had completely overhauled its cookie policy. These changes have led, in particular, to stopping the automatic deposit of cookies on arrival on the home page of the site since March 4, 2020. III. On corrective measures and advertising 78. Under III of Article 20 of the Data Protection Act: ''When the data controller or his subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or from this law, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms may also, if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, if necessary in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, seize the restricted committee with a view to pronouncing, after contradictory procedure, of one or more of the following measures: \[…\]'' ''7 ° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the worldwide annual turnover total for the previous year, whichever is higher. Under the assumptions mentioned in 5 and 6 of article 83 of regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are raised, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted committee takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83.'' 79. L’article 83 du RGPD prévoit : ''1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive.'' ''2. Depending on the specific characteristics of each case, administrative fines are imposed in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in Article 58 (2) (a) to (h) and (j). In deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the amount of the administrative fine, due account shall be taken in each individual case of the following:'' ''a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage they suffered;'' ''(b) whether the violation was committed willfully or negligently;'' ''c) any measure taken by the controller or the processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects;'' ''d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or the processor, taking into account the technical and organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;'' ''e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or processor;'' ''(f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the violation and mitigating any negative effects thereof;'' ''g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;'' ''(h) how the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, including whether, and to what extent, the controller or processor notified the breach;'' ''(i) where measures referred to in Article 58 (2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the same purpose, compliance with those measures;'' ''(j) the application of codes of conduct approved under Article 40 or certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and'' ''k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or indirectly, as a result of the violation.'' 80. '''In the first place''' , concerning the proposed sanction, the company maintains that since the breaches of loyalty and information are not characterized, the pronouncement of an administrative fine does not appear necessary. 81. It argues that it would be appropriate in any event to reduce the amount of the proposed fine, in so far as the infringements complained of are devoid of seriousness and that it has operated, since the start of the sanction procedure, an important work of compliance. 82. In the light of the relevant criteria provided for in article 83 of the Rules, the Restricted Panel considers, on the contrary, that the pronouncement of an administrative fine is necessary. 83. In this case, as regards, first, the nature, gravity and duration of the violation, the Restricted Committee notes that this criterion is characterized for the breach linked to loyalty as soon as the company has provides its customers with information that is contrary to the reality of the treatments implemented. 84. Second, with regard to the number of people concerned, the restricted committee emphasizes that the breach relating to cookies concerned a significant number of people since the cookies made it possible to follow in the same way, without distinction, online behavior subscribers of the Pass card and any prospects of the company, but also of all Internet users likely to browse its website. 85. In addition, breaches of loyalty and information also concerned all Pass card subscribers, whether or not they are attached to the Carrefour loyalty program, which, according to the elements noted by the delegation of control, amount to to at least \[…\] people. 86. Thirdly, with regard to the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects and the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority, the restricted formation notes the perfect cooperation of the company throughout the sanctioning procedure and the very significant efforts made to achieve full compliance on the day of the session. It notes that the three shortcomings have been corrected to date. 87. Regarding the amount of the administrative fine, the restricted committee recalls that in 2018 the company achieved net banking income of 308 million euros and that in application of the provisions of article 83, paragraph 5 , it incurs a financial penalty of a maximum amount of 20 million euros. 88. Therefore, having regard to the financial capacities of the company and the relevant criteria of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the Rules mentioned above, the restricted panel considers that the imposition of a fine of € 800,000, which would therefore only represent 0.25% of this net banking income, appears to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive at the same time, in accordance with the requirements of Article 83, paragraph 1, of this Regulation. 89. '''In the second place''' , concerning the issuance of an injunction, the company maintains that insofar as it has remedied all the breaches alleged against it, the requests formulated under the injunction proposed under penalty charge lose all foundation. 90. The restricted committee notes in fact that, once the company has corrected all the shortcomings noted in the sanction report, the issuance of an injunction is no longer justified. 91. '''Thirdly''' , with regard to the publicity of this decision, the company maintains that such a measure would not respect the constitutional principle of the necessity of penalties since it would already have been part of an approach consisting in strengthening the compliance of its situation to the requirements of data protection regulations. She adds that advertising would have particularly damaging consequences in that it could affect its reputation in a lasting way. 92. The restricted committee considers that the publication of this decision is justified in view of the seriousness of the breaches sanctioned and the number of people concerned. 93. It considers that this measure will make it possible to inform all of the company's customers and potential prospects of the existence of various sanctioned breaches and in particular breaches of disloyalty and cookies. 94. Finally, the measure is not disproportionate since the decision will no longer identify the company by name after the expiry of a period of two years from its publication. 95. It follows from all of the above and from the consideration of the criteria set out in article 83 of the Regulation that an administrative fine of up to 800,000 euros as well as an additional publication sanction for a period of two years are justified and proportionate. '''FOR THESE REASONS''' '''The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to:''' · '''Decision against the company CARREFOUR BANK an administrative fine of EUR 800,000 (eight hundred thousand) euros for breaches of Articles 5, paragraph 1 a), 12 and 13 GDPR and Article RGPD 82 of the Data Protection Act;''' · '''Make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the company by name after the expiration of a period of two years from its publication.'''

Facts and procedure 1. GOOGLE LLC is a limited liability company headquartered in California (United States). Since its creation in 1998, it has developed many services for individuals and businesses, such as the search engine Google Search , the mailbox, the Gmail mapping Google Maps service and the video YouTube platform . It has more than 70 offices in some 50 countries and in 2019 employed more than 110,000 people around the world. Since August 2015, it has been a 100% -owned subsidiary of ALPHABET Inc., parent company of the GOOGLE group. 2. In 2019, ALPHABET Inc. had sales of over $ 161 billion, while GOOGLE LLC had sales of over $ 160 billion . \[…\] 3. GOOGLE IRELAND LIMITED (hereinafter GIL) presents itself as the headquarters of the GOOGLE group for its activities in the European Economic Area (hereinafter EEA) and in Switzerland. Based in Dublin (Ireland), it employs around 9,000 people. In 2018, it achieved a turnover of more than 38 billion euros. 4. GOOGLE FRANCE SARL is the French establishment of the GOOGLE group. Subsidiary 100% owned by GOOGLE LLC, its head office is located in Paris (France). In 2018, it employed around 1,400 people and had a turnover of more than 400 million euros. 5. Pursuant to the Commission President's decision n ° 2020-072C of March 15, 2020, the CNIL services carried out an online check, on March 16, 2020, on the google.fr website. 6. This mission was especially designed to verify compliance by the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL (the companies) to all the provisions of Law n o 78-17 of 6 January 1978 relating to IT, files and freedoms (hereinafter the Data Protection Act) and in particular Article 82. 7. As part of the online control, the delegation was thus able to observe that when a user goes to the google.fr page, several cookies are automatically placed on his terminal, without any action on his part, as soon as he arrives on the website. site. On March 16, 2020, the delegation notified the companies of the report drawn up in the context of the online control, asking them, in particular, to specify the purposes of the various cookies whose deposit had been noted. 8. By letter of April 30, 2020, the company GIL responded on its behalf to the latter request while considering that the CNIL did not have the competence to control the google.fr website. 9. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission appointed Mr. Bertrand du MARAIS as rapporteur, on June 8, 2020, on the basis of article 22 of the Data Protection Act. 10. By letter of June 29, 2020, the companies were invited to a hearing on the following July 15, in application of article 39 of decree n ° 2019-536 of May 29, 2019. At the companies' request, the rapporteur accepted , by letter of the following July 9, a postponement of the hearing to July 22, 2020. 11. During the hearing on July 22, 2020, which gave rise to a report signed by all the parties present, the companies notably provided answers to the rapporteur's questions relating to the determination of the controller. concerning the processing consisting of operations of accessing or registering information in the terminal of users residing in France when using the search engine Google Search . 12. By letter of July 29, 2020, the company GIL responded to several of the additional requests made by the rapporteur at the end of the hearing on July 22, 2020, by providing, in particular, the subcontracting contract of December 11. 2018 concluded with the company GOOGLE LLC. On the other hand, they did not produce the income of the company GIL from the activity of google.fr and GOOGLE FRANCE under its commission of business introducer, however requested by the rapporteur. 13. At the end of his investigation, on August 12, 2020, the rapporteur had the company councils personally served and by email to their representatives a report detailing the breach of the Data Protection Act that he considered constituted. in this case. 14. This report proposed to the restricted formation of the Commission to issue an injunction to bring the processing into line with the provisions of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, accompanied by a fine, as well as an administrative fine to against both companies. He also proposed that this decision be made public and no longer allow companies to be identified by name after a period of two years from its publication. 15. On August 18, 2020, through their counsel, the companies made a request that the session before the restricted panel be held in camera, a request which was rejected by the chair of the restricted panel by letter from the September 23, 2020. 16. On September 25, 2020, the companies filed comments in response to the sanction report. 17. The rapporteur responded to the companies' comments on October 9, 2020. 18. By e-mail of October 15, 2020, the companies requested an extension of the fifteen-day period provided for by article 40 of decree n ° 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 to produce rejoinder observations, a request which was rejected. by the president of the restricted formation by letter of October 16, 2020. 19. On October 26, 2020, the companies filed new comments in response to those of the rapporteur. 20. The companies and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the session of the restricted formation. 21. By email of December 2, 2020, the companies sent a note under advisement to the chairman of the restricted formation. II. Reasons for the decision A. On the competence of the CNIL 1. On the material competence of the CNIL and the applicability of the one-stop-shop mechanism provided for by the GDPR 22. The provisions of Directive 2002/58 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (hereinafter the ePrivacy Directive ) relating to the storage or access to information already stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user have been transposed into internal law in article 82 of the Data Protection Act, within the chapter IV Rights and obligations specific to processing in the electronic communications sector of this law. 23. Pursuant to article 16 of the Data Protection Act , the restricted body takes measures and pronounces penalties against data controllers or subcontractors who do not comply with the obligations arising from \[…\] from this law . Under the terms of article 20, paragraph III, of the same law, when the data controller or his subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting \[…\] from this law, the president of the National IT Commission and freedoms \[…\] can seize the restricted formation . 24. The rapporteur considers that the CNIL is materially competent in application of these provisions to control and sanction the operations of access or registration of information implemented by the companies in the terminals of users of the search engine Google Search residing in France. 25. The companies recognize that the facts of the present procedure are materially covered by the ePrivacy directive but consider that they should be subject to the procedural framework provided for by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016. (hereinafter the Regulation or the GDPR), that is to say the cooperation mechanism between the supervisory authorities, known as the one-stop-shop mechanism, provided for in Chapter VII of the Regulation. Pursuant to this mechanism, the supervisory authority competent to hear the facts in question would not be the CNIL but the Irish data protection authority, the Data Protection Commission (hereinafter the DPC), which should act as as the leading authority with regard to the deployment of cookies by the company GOOGLE IRELAND LIMITED, the latter being competent according to the companies both under the GDPR and the ePrivacy directive. 26. In support of this, the companies rely, in particular, on the adage specialia generalibus derogant according to which, according to them, the absence of specific rules relating to the determination of the competence of the supervisory authority in the event of cross-border processing in the ePrivacy directive should be supplemented by the application of the procedural framework provided for by the GDPR. They maintain that a teleological reading of the preparatory work of the GDPR and its recitals would support the same direction. They add that the exclusion of the one-stop-shop mechanism in the present case would contribute to the fragmentation of European regulations on personal data relating to cookies, a fragmentation which would already be verified by the fact that several supervisory authorities (the authorities French, British and Spanish) have adopted guidelines or even divergent repressive policies with regard to these devices. 27. The restricted formation notes, first of all, that it emerges from the provisions cited above that the French legislator has instructed the CNIL to ensure that data controllers comply with the provisions of the ePrivacy directive transposed to the article 82 of the Data Protection Act, in particular by giving it the power to penalize any disregard of this article. It underlines that this competence was recognized by the Council of State in its decision Association of communication consulting agencies of June 19, 2020 concerning the CNIL deliberation n o 2019-093 adopting guidelines relating to the application of article 82 of the law of January 6, 1978 amended to read or write operations in a user's terminal, since the latter noted that article 20 of this law entrusts its president \[of the CNIL\] the power to take corrective measures in the event of non-compliance with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/279 or its own provisions, as well as the possibility of seizing the restricted committee with a view to the pronouncement of sanctions that may be imposed (CE, June 19, 2020, req. 434684, pt. 3). 28. It notes, next, that when processing falls both within the material scope of the ePrivacy directive and the material scope of the GDPR, reference should be made to the relevant provisions of the two texts which provide for their joint. Thus, Article 1 st paragraph 2 of the ePrivacy Directive provides that the provisions of this Directive particularise and complement Directive 95/46 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of personal data (hereinafter after Directive 95/46 / EC on the protection of personal data ), it being recalled that since the entry into application of the Regulation, the references made to this last directive must be understood as made to the GDPR, in accordance with article 94 of the last. Likewise, it is apparent from recital 173 of the GDPR that this text explicitly provides that it does not apply to the processing of personal data subject to specific obligations having the same objective \[of protecting fundamental rights and freedoms\] set out in Directive 2002 / 58 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, including the obligations of the controller and the rights of natural persons. This articulation was confirmed by the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter ECJ) in its decision Planet49 1 st October 2019 (CJEU, 1 st October 2019, C-673/17, pt. 42). 29. In this regard, the Restricted Committee notes that, contrary to what companies maintain, the ePrivacy Directive does provide, for the specific obligations it entails, its own mechanism for implementing and monitoring its application within of its article 15bis. Thus, the first paragraph of this article leaves to the Member States the competence to determine the system of sanctions, including criminal sanctions if necessary, applicable to violations of the national provisions adopted in application of this directive and to take any measures necessary to ensure the implementation of these. The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and may be applied to cover the duration of the infringement, even if it has subsequently been corrected . However, the rule laid down in 3 of article 5 of the ePrivacy directive, according to which read and write operations must systematically be the subject of a prior consent of the user, after information, constitutes a special rule in the with regard to the GDPR since it prohibits taking advantage of the legal bases mentioned in article 6 which do not require the consent of the user in order to be able to lawfully carry out these read and write operations on the terminal. The control of this rule therefore falls under the special control and sanction mechanism provided for by the ePrivacy directive and not by the data protection authorities and the EDPS in application of the GDPR. It is by their own choice that the legislator in France has entrusted this mission to the CNIL. 30. In addition, the second paragraph of the same article obliges member states to ensure that the competent national authority and, where appropriate, other national bodies have the power to order the cessation of the offenses referred to in paragraph 1. . 31. The Restricted Committee considers that these latter provisions as such exclude the application of the one-stop-shop mechanism provided for by the GDPR to facts falling under the ePrivacy directive. 32. It adds, moreover, that that exclusion is corroborated by the fact that the Member States, which are free to determine the national authority competent to deal with violations of the national provisions adopted pursuant to the ePrivacy directive, may have attributed this jurisdiction to an authority other than their national data protection authority established by the GDPR, in this case to their telecommunications regulatory authority. Therefore, insofar as these latter authorities are not part of the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter EDPS), while this committee plays an essential function in the consistency control mechanism implemented in Chapter VII of the GDPR, it is in fact impossible to apply the one-stop shop to practices liable to be sanctioned by national supervisory authorities not sitting on this committee. 33. It emphasizes that the EDPS also shares the same interpretation, having specified in particular, in his opinion n ° 5/2019 of 12 March 2019 relating to the interactions between the Directive on privacy and electronic communications and the GDPR, that the mechanisms of GDPR does not apply to monitoring the application of the provisions of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive as such (pt. 80, free translation). 34. Finally, the restricted committee noted that the possible application of the one-stop-shop mechanism to processing governed by the ePrivacy directive is currently the subject of numerous discussions as part of the development of the current draft ePrivacy regulation. negotiation for three years at European level. It notes that the very existence of these debates confirms that, as it stands, the one-stop-shop mechanism provided for by the GDPR is not applicable for matters governed by the current ePrivacy directive. It underlines that the EDPS opinion of 19 November 2020, invoked by the companies in their note under advisement of 2 December 2020, corroborates this analysis since in this opinion the EDPS merely calls for the application of the window. unique to the future regulation, proof that in the state of positive law, this mechanism does not apply to the cookie provisions of the ePrivacy directive in force. 35. It follows from the foregoing that the one-stop-shop mechanism provided for by the GDPR is not applicable to this procedure and that the CNIL is competent to control and sanction the processing carried out by companies falling within the scope of application of the ePrivacy directive, provided that they fall within its territorial jurisdiction. 2. On the territorial jurisdiction of the CNIL 36. The rule of territorial application of the requirements set in Article 82 of the Data Protection Act is set out in Article 3, paragraph I, of the Data Protection Act which provides: without prejudice, with regard to processing within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, of the criteria provided for in Article 3 of this Regulation, all the provisions of this law apply to the processing of personal data carried out within the framework of the activities of an establishment of a controller (…) on French territory, whether or not the processing takes place in France . 37. The rapporteur considers that the CNIL has territorial jurisdiction in application of these provisions when the processing object of this procedure, consisting of operations to access or register information in the terminal of users residing in France during the use of the search engine Google Search , in particular for advertising purposes, is carried out within the framework of the activities of the company GOOGLE FRANCE, which constitutes the establishment on the French territory of the GOOGLE group. 38. The companies maintain that insofar as it would be appropriate to apply the rules of jurisdiction and the cooperation procedures defined in the GDPR, the CNIL does not have the territorial jurisdiction to hear this case given that the actual headquarters of the group GOOGLE in Europe, i.e. the place of its central administration within the meaning of Article 56 of the GDPR, is located in Ireland. 39. The Restricted Panel once again holds that since the facts in question materially fall under the provisions of the ePrivacy directive, and not of the GDPR, the one-stop-shop mechanism provided for by the latter is not applicable in the present case. It deduces from this that it is appropriate to refer to the provisions of Article 3, paragraph I, of the Data Protection Act , determining the scope of the territorial jurisdiction of the CNIL. 40. In this regard, the restricted committee emphasizes that the ePrivacy directive, adopted in 2002 and amended in 2006 and then in 2009, does not itself explicitly set the rule of territorial application of the various transposition laws adopted by each Member State. . However, this directive indicates that it clarifies and supplements Directive 95 / 46.CE, which at the time provided, in Article 4, that Each Member State shall apply the national provisions which it adopts pursuant to this Directive to processing of personal data when: a) the processing is carried out within the framework of the activities of an establishment of the controller in the territory of the Member State; if the same controller is established in the territory of several Member States, he must take the necessary measures to ensure that each of his establishments complies with the obligations provided for by the applicable national law. This rule for determining the national law applicable within the Union is no longer relevant for the application of the rules of the GDPR, which replaced Directive 95/46 / EC on the protection of personal data and 'applies uniformly throughout the territory of the Union, but it is logical that the French legislator has maintained the criterion of territorial application for the specific rules of French law, in particular those which transpose the ePrivacy directive. Consequently, the case law of the CJEU on the application of Article 4 of the former Directive 95/46 / EC on the protection of personal data remains relevant, insofar as the French legislator has used these same criteria to define the territorial jurisdiction of the CNIL. 41. Thus, as regards, in the first place, the existence of an establishment of the controller on French territory , the CJEU has consistently considered that the concept of establishment should be assessed extensively and that To this end, it was necessary to assess both the degree of stability of the installation and the reality of carrying out activities in another Member State, taking into account the specific nature of the economic activities and the provision of services in question ( see, e.g., ECJ Weltimmo , 1 st October 2015, C-230/14, pts. 30 and 31). The CJEU further considers that a company, an autonomous legal person, of the same group as the controller, can constitute an establishment of the controller within the meaning of these provisions (CJEU, May 13, 2014, Google Spain , C-131 / 12, pt 48). 42. In this case, the restricted formation notes, first of all, that the company GOOGLE FRANCE is the head office of the French subsidiary of the company GOOGLE LLC, that it has premises located in Paris, that it employs approximately 1,400 people and that, according to its statutes filed with the registry of the Paris Commercial Court, its main purpose is to provide services and / or advice relating to software, the Internet, telematic or online networks, in particular 'intermediation in the sale of online advertising, promotion in all its forms of online advertising, direct promotion of products and services and the implementation of information processing center . The restricted committee then notes that it emerges from the hearing of July 22, 2020 that the company GOOGLE FRANCE is responsible for promoting online advertising on behalf of the company GIL, which is a co-contractor of advertising contracts concluded with French companies or French subsidiaries of foreign companies. It notes, finally, that the company GOOGLE FRANCE effectively participates in the promotion of products and services designed and developed by the company GOOGLE LLC, such as Google Search , in France, as well as in the advertising activities managed by the company GIL. 43. As regards, secondly, the existence of processing carried out in the context of the activities of this establishment, the restricted committee notes that the CJEU, in its judgment Google Spain of 13 May 2014, considered that the processing relating to the search engine Google Search was carried out within the framework of the activities of the company GOOGLE SPAIN, establishment of the company GOOGLE INC - since now GOOGLE LLC -, insofar as the company GOOGLE SPAIN is intended to ensure the promotion in Spain and the sale of advertising space offered by this search engine, which is used to make the service offered by this search engine profitable. If, in the judgment, Google Spain the establishment of the controller was established outside the European Union, the Court subsequently, in its judgment Facebook Ireland Ltd of 5 June 2018, applied the same extensive interpretation of processing carried out within the framework of the activities of a national establishment in a situation where the processing was partly under the responsibility of another establishment present within the European Union (CJEU, June 5, 2018, C-210/16, pts 53 sq). Finally, it should be noted that the interpretation of the concept of processing carried out within the framework of the activities of a national establishment of the controller has no impact on the fact that the debtor of the obligations remains the controller and, the if applicable, its subcontractor. 44. In the present case, the restricted formation notes, first of all, that it appears from the press releases of the company GOOGLE FRANCE posted online on its website that the latter's mission is in particular to support small and medium-sized enterprises. in France through the development of collaboration tools, advertising solutions or to give them the keys to understanding their markets and consumers . It then notes that in its letter of April 30, 2020, the company GIL indicates that Google France has a sales team dedicated to the promotion and sale of GIL's services with regard to advertisers and publishers based in France, like Google Ads. Finally, it notes that the GOOGLE group specifies on its ads.google.com website that Google Ads allows French companies to promote their products or services on the search engine and on a large advertising network. 45. Therefore, the processing consisting of operations of access or registration of information in the terminal of users of the search engine Google Search residing in France, in particular for advertising purposes, is carried out within the framework of the activities of the company GOOGLE FRANCE on French territory, which is in charge of promoting and marketing GOOGLE products and their advertising solutions in France. The restricted committee notes that the two criteria provided for in Article 3, paragraph I, of the Data Protection Act are therefore met and that the processing is sufficiently territorialized in France to be subject to French law. The application of French law only concerns reading and writing operations carried out on French territory (Article 4 of Directive 95/46 / EC on the protection of personal data also specified that the Member State law only applied to the activities of the establishment on the territory of the Member State ), which corresponds to data read on terminals in France or writing on these terminals in France. Lastly, the restricted panel underlines that this is a constant position on its part since the intervention of the case law Google Spain in 2014 (see in particular the CNIL decision, restricted panel, April 27, 2017, SAN-2017-006 ; CNIL, restricted training, December 19, 2018, SAN-2018-011). 46. ​​It follows from the foregoing that French law is applicable and that the CNIL is materially and territorially competent to exercise its powers, including that of taking a sanctioning measure concerning the processing in question which falls within the scope of application of the ePrivacy directive. B. On the determination of the controller 47. According to Article 4 (7) of the GDPR, the controller is the natural or legal person, public authority, department or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing . According to Article 26 (1) of the GDPR, where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing, they are the joint controllers. 48. The rapporteur considers that the companies GIL and GOOGLE LLC are jointly responsible for the processing in question in application of these provisions since the companies both determine the purposes and means of the processing consisting of access or access operations. registration of information in the terminal of users Google Search residing in France. 49. The companies reply that the GIL company is solely responsible for the processing in question. \[…\] The company GIL would be responsible for processing most Google services and products processing the personal data of users residing in the EEA and Switzerland, including cookies, while the company GOOGLE LLC would only be sub- dealing with the first. They also highlight the participation of the company GIL in the various stages and instances of the decision-making process set up by the group to define the characteristics of the cookies placed on Google Search and underline that a series of differences concerning specifically the cookies placed on the terminals of European users using the engine Google Search (different retention periods, compliance with obligations relating to minors within the meaning of the GDPR, etc.) attest to the decision-making autonomy of GIL in this area. 50. The restricted committee notes, first of all, that Articles 4, paragraph 7, and 26, paragraph 1, of the GDPR are applicable to this procedure because of the use of the concept of data controller in Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, which is justified by the reference made by Article 2 of the ePrivacy Directive to Directive 95/46 / EC on the protection of personal data, which has been replaced by the GDPR. 51. The restricted panel then recalls that the CJEU has ruled, on several occasions, on the concept of joint responsibility for processing, in particular in its judgment Jehovah's Witnesses under which it considered that according to the provisions of the Article 2 (d) of Directive 95/46 on the protection of personal data, the concept of controller refers to the natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing of personal data. This concept does not therefore necessarily refer to a single natural or legal person and may concern several actors participating in this processing, each of them then having to be subject to the applicable data protection provisions (…). The objective of this provision being to ensure, by a broad definition of the concept of responsible, an effective and complete protection of the persons concerned, the existence of a joint liability does not necessarily translate into an equivalent liability, for a same processing of personal data, of the different actors. On the contrary, these actors can be involved at different stages of this processing and to different degrees, so that the level of responsibility of each of them must be assessed taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the case ( CJEU, July 10, 2018, C ‑ 25/17, pts. 65 and 66). 52. The restricted committee therefore considers that these developments make it possible to usefully shed light on the concept of joint processing responsibility invoked by the rapporteur with regard to the GOOGLE LLC and GIL companies concerned by the processing in question. 1. On the responsibility of the company GIL 53. The companies claim that GIL is acting as the controller in question, which the rapporteur also acknowledges. 54. The Restricted Committee shares this analysis. 55. In the first place, it thus notes that, during the hearing of 22 July 2020, the representatives of the companies declared that the company GIL participates in the development and supervision of the internal policies which guide the products and their design, in the setting up the parameters, determining the confidentiality rules and all the checks carried out before the launch of products, in application of the principle of privacy by design . 56. Secondly, it emphasizes that, more particularly with regard to cookies, the representatives stated during the hearing that GIL applies, for example, shorter retention periods for cookies compared to other regions of the world and that it limits the scope of processing related to the personalization of advertising in Europe compared to the rest of the world. For example, GIL does not use certain categories of data to perform personalized advertising such as deemed household resources. GIL does not set up personalized advertising for children whom it assumes are minors within the meaning of the GDPR . 57. It emerges from this that the company GIL is, at least in part, responsible for the controlled processing consisting of operations of access or registration of information in the terminal of users residing in France when using the search engine. search Google search . 2. On the responsibility of GOOGLE LLC 58. The companies dispute the rapporteur's analysis according to which the company GOOGLE LLC shares the responsibility for the processing in question with the company GIL. 59. The restricted committee notes, firstly, that during the hearing of July 22, 2020, the companies affirmed that it is indeed the company GOOGLE LLC which designs and builds the technology of Google products and that, as regards the cookies placed and read when using the search engine Google Search , there is no difference in technology between the cookies placed from the different versions of the search engine. 60. Similarly, companies, in the information they offer to French users in the rules of use accessible from google.fr, make no distinction in their presentation of the cookies used by the GOOGLE group when they indicate using different types of cookies for the products associated with the advertisements and the websites of Google. 61. Secondly, the restricted committee observes that despite the undisputed participation of the company GIL in the various stages and bodies related to the definition of the methods of implementation of the cookies placed on Google Search , the matrix organization described by the companies during the hearing of July 22, 2020 showed that the company GOOGLE LLC is also represented in the bodies adopting decisions relating to the deployment of products within the EEA and in Switzerland and to the processing of users' personal data therein. resident and exerts a significant influence there \[…\]. 62. Similarly, the restricted committee notes that the data protection officer appointed by the company GIL (hereinafter DPO) and its deputy DPOs are based in California as employees of the company GOOGLE LLC. In this regard, it emerges from the own statements of the representatives of the companies made during the hearing of July 22, 2020 that the GOOGLE group made this choice so that the DPO of the company GIL is as close as possible to the decision-makers of the company . 63. Third, the restricted panel considers that the differences that companies highlight between cookies placed on European user terminals and those intended for other users (different retention periods, compliance with obligations relating to minors within the meaning of of the GDPR, etc.) are only differences in execution which do not call into question the overall advertising purpose for which they are used, this purpose being determined in particular by the company GOOGLE LLC. Although the main purpose of these differences is to ensure compliance with European law on cookies placed on European user terminals, they do not, as such, illustrate GIL's decision-making autonomy over all essential characteristics of the means and purposes of the processing in question. 64. Fourth, the restricted committee notes that although by virtue of a formal reading of the subcontracting contract of December 11, 2018, the company GOOGLE LLC would act as a subcontractor of the company GIL in the processing of data European users collected via cookies, the real involvement of the company GOOGLE LLC in the processing in question goes far beyond that of a subcontractor who would be content to carry out processing operations on behalf of the GIL company and on its sole instructions. 65. The restricted committee considers that these latest developments show that, despite the entry into force of the subcontracting contract on January 22, 2019, the company GOOGLE LLC continues to play a fundamental role in the entire decision-making process relating to on the treatment in question. It also determines the means of processing given that, as mentioned above, it is it who designs and builds the technology for cookies placed on the terminals of European users. Consequently, the restricted committee retains that it is appropriate to also attribute to him the quality of controller. 66. It follows from all of the foregoing that the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL jointly determine the purposes and means of processing consisting of operations to access or register information in the terminal of users residing in France. when using the search engine Google Search . C. On the breach of obligations regarding cookies 67. Under the terms of article 82 of the Data Protection Act (formerly, article 32, paragraph II, of this same law) any subscriber or user of an electronic communications service must be informed in a clear and complete manner, except if it has been previously, by the controller or his representative: 1 ° The purpose of any action aimed at accessing, by electronic transmission, information already stored in his electronic communications terminal equipment, or to write information in this equipment; 2 ° The means at his disposal to oppose it. These accesses or registrations can only take place on condition that the subscriber or user has expressed, after receiving this information, his consent which may result from appropriate parameters of his connection device or any other device placed under his control. These provisions are not applicable if access to information stored in the user's terminal equipment or the recording of information in the user's terminal equipment: 1 ° Either, for the sole purpose of enabling or facilitate electronic communication; 2 ° Either, is strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user . 68. In this case, the members of the delegation noted during the online check of March 16, 2020 that, when they arrived on the google.fr website, seven cookies were placed on their terminal equipment, before any action on their part. In its letter of April 30, 2020, the company GIL indicated that four of these seven cookies pursue an advertising purpose. 1. On the lack of information of people 69. The rapporteur maintains that the information provided to users residing in France relating to operations to access or register information in their terminal when using the search engine Google Search was insufficient and unclear, in violation of the requirements of article 82 of the Data Protection Act. 70. The company GIL, which considers itself the sole data controller in question, replies that no legal provision prescribes specific practical arrangements for the data controller to inform its users, as long as they are effectively informed, and maintains that it has opted for level information, as recommended by the Article 29 Group (which has become EDPS since the entry into force of the GDPR) in its guidelines on transparency within the meaning of the Regulation, adopted in their revised version on 11 April 2018. 71. It thus argues that its first level of information complied with the requirements of transparency and accessibility of information since it redirected users to the rest of the information, and in particular that relating to cookies. It argues that it provided, as part of the second level, specific information on the processing of cookies, namely their purposes and the means made available to the user to oppose them. 72. First of all , the restricted committee recalls that under article 82 of the Data Protection Act, access to or registration of cookies in a user's terminal can only take place on the condition that this the latter has consented to it after having received \[ \] information clear and complete relating to the purposes of the cookies placed and the means at his disposal to oppose them. 73. The Restricted Committee considers that for the purposes of interpreting these provisions, it is relevant to refer to recital 25 of the ePrivacy directive, which provides that the methods used to communicate information, offer a right of refusal or request the consent should be as user-friendly as possible . 74. The restricted committee also points out that the CNIL has adopted several flexible law legal instruments detailing the obligations of data controllers with regard to tracers, including, in particular, a recommendation of 5 December 2013 as well as guidelines of 4 July 2019, in force on the date of the online check. Although devoid of mandatory value, these instruments provide useful insight to data controllers by informing them about the implementation of concrete measures to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act relating to trackers so that they either implement these measures, or they implement measures having equivalent effect. 75. In this regard, in Article 2 of its 2013 recommendation, the Commission recalled in particular that the information had to be prior to the collection of consent but also visible, highlighted and complete . Consequently, the Commission recommended that data controllers implement a two-stage consent collection mechanism: - first step: the Internet user who visits a publisher's site (home page or secondary page of the site) must be informed, by the appearance of a banner: of the precise purposes of the cookies used; the possibility of opposing these cookies and changing the settings by clicking on a link in the banner ; - second step: people must be informed in a simple and intelligible way of the solutions made available to them to accept or refuse all or part of the Cookies requiring the collection of consent: for all the technologies referred to in the aforementioned article 32-II ; by categories of purposes: in particular advertising, social network buttons and audience measurement . 76. Such recommendations were included in the guidelines of 4 July 2019, in equivalent terms. 77. In the present case, the restricted committee notes, first, that it emerges from the online control of March 16, 2020 that when a user arrived on the google.fr page, an information banner was displayed at the bottom of page, containing in particular the following statement Reminder concerning the rules of confidentiality of Google in front of which appeared two buttons entitled Remind me later or Consult now. 78. The restricted committee thus holds that no information relating to the deposit of cookies on the terminal equipment was provided at this stage to the persons concerned on this banner even though cookies with an advertising purpose had already been deposited on their terminal. as soon as they arrive on the google.fr page. She adds that the simple reference to the rules of confidentiality was far from being sufficiently explicit at this stage to allow people reading this banner to know that information relating to cookies was available later in the navigation path, to respond to their requests. expectations in this area and to meet the requirements of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act. 79. The Restricted Committee stresses, second, that it emerges from the findings made during the online check that the confidentiality rules which opened in pop-up windows when people clicked on the button Consult now still did not contain any development dedicated to the use of cookies and other tracers, despite general information relating to personal data processed by Google services. 80. Furthermore, people were still not informed at this stage that they could refuse cookies on their terminal equipment, since they were only advised that they could manage the search results according to the search activity in this browser or manage the types of Google ads that appear . 81. Finally, the information provided in the context of this pop-up window did not include, again, any explicit reference to the confidentiality rules applicable to cookies. If the companies ensure that the latter were well provided to the user, the limited training notes that the information architecture implemented by the companies was such that to achieve this the user had to understand for himself that he had to scroll through the content of the entire pop-up window, without clicking on one of the five hypertext links appearing in this content ( our rules, Find out more, Modify search parameters, Modify ad parameters, Modify Youtube parameters ), to finally click on the button More options at the bottom of the window. 82. Consequently, the Restricted Committee notes that the information provided by the companies, both in the context of the banner and that of the pop-up window, did not allow users residing in France, when they arrived on the search engine Google Search, to be previously and clearly informed of the existence of operations allowing access and registration of information contained in their terminal nor, consequently, of the purpose of these and the means available to them. provision as to the possibility of refusing them. 83. Secondly , the restricted committee notes that since the initiation of the sanction procedure, companies have undertaken a series of changes in the way they use cookies. 84. The first update was first made available to search engine users not logged in to a Google account as of August 17, 2020 and fully rolled out to all users on September 10, 2020 \[…\] 85. The company GIL highlights that \[…\], the new information provided to users meets the requirements of article 82 of the Data Protection Act. 86. The restricted training notes that people who go to the google.fr site now see, in the middle of their screen, before being able to access the search engine, a pop-up window entitled Before continuing which contains the development next: Google uses cookies and other data to provide, manage and improve its services and ads. If you agree, we'll personalize the content and ads you see based on your activity on Google services like Search, Maps, and YouTube. Some of our partners also assess how our services are used. Click on ""More Information"" to find out what options are available to you or visit g.co/privacytools at any time , the terms cookies , partners and g.co/privacytools being clickable links. At the bottom of this pop-up window are two buttons labeled More Info and I Agree . 87. The restricted committee notes that companies now provide prior information relating to cookies as soon as users visiting the google.fr page are now openly and directly informed of the fact that companies use cookies, which constitutes a undeniable advance compared to previous information banners. 88. However, the restricted committee considers that the information provided is still not clear and complete within the meaning of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, insofar as this information does not inform the user on the '' all the purposes of the cookies placed and the means at his disposal to oppose them. 89. Thus, the description of the various purposes mentioned in this banner remains too general for users to be able to easily and clearly understand for what specific uses cookies are placed on their terminal. 90. The user is in particular not able to understand the type of content and advertisements likely to be personalized according to his behavior - for example, if it is geolocated advertising -, the exact nature Google services that use personalization or the fact that this personalization operates between these different services. 91. The restricted committee considers, moreover, that the information provided is incomplete since users are still not informed about their possibility of refusing these cookies, nor about the means made available to them for this. Indeed, the terms options or More information are not explicit enough to allow users to directly understand the extent of their rights with regard to cookies placed on their terminal. 92. \[…\] 93. In view of all of the foregoing, the restricted committee considers that a breach of the provisions relating to the information of persons of article 82 of the Data Protection Act has been established. 94. The restricted committee notes that this breach persists at the date of the closing of the investigation, the modifications made by the companies since the initiation of the sanction procedure not having made it possible to bring this information into conformity with the requirements. of article 82 data processing and freedoms. 2. On the failure to collect consent from people before placing cookies on their terminal and the inability for people to refuse the deposit of all cookies at. On the failure to collect consent from people before placing cookies on their terminal 95. The rapporteur maintains that the companies violated the provisions of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act relating to the consent of individuals insofar as, during the online check of March 16, 2020, it was found that from the When the user arrived on the google.fr page, several cookies pursuing an advertising purpose were placed on his terminal before any action on his part. 96. The company GIL does not dispute this branch of the infringement. 97. The restricted committee notes that under Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, access or registration \[of cookies\] can only take place on condition that the subscriber or the user has expressed, after have received this information, their consent which may result from appropriate parameters of their connection device or any other device under their control . Only cookies whose sole purpose is to allow or facilitate communication by electronic means, or those strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user, are exempt from this obligation. 98. In the present case, the restricted committee emphasizes that the online check of March 16, 2020 made it possible to observe that upon arrival on the google.fr page, seven cookies were automatically placed on the delegation terminal, before any action on his part. 99. The restricted committee notes that the company GIL indicated in its letter of April 30, 2020 that four of the seven cookies deposited, namely the NID, IDE, ANID and 1P\_JAR cookies, pursue an advertising purpose. 100. Since these four cookies are not intended exclusively to allow or facilitate communication by electronic means nor are they strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user, the restricted training considers that companies should have obtained prior consent from users, before depositing them on the latter's terminal. 101. In view of the foregoing, the restricted committee considers that a breach of the obligation provided for by article 82 of the Data Protection Act to obtain prior consent from people before placing cookies on their terminal has been established. . 102. It nonetheless emphasizes that during the sanctioning procedure the companies made changes to the google.fr page, which in particular led, since September 10, 2020, to stopping the automatic deposit of these four cookies upon arrival. of the user on the page. b. On the partially defective nature of the opposition mechanism put in place by Google. 103. The rapporteur maintains that in addition to the fact that consent, when necessary, was not obtained, the system put in place by companies to oppose cookies for advertising purposes placed on the terminal of the user was also partially defective, in violation of the requirements of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act. 104. The company GIL disputes this assessment and replies that it took, and continues to take into account, the user's choice to withdraw his consent through a mechanism allowing users to personalize ads on Google search as well as on the web . 105. In the present case, the restricted committee firstly emphasizes that the companies depositing these cookies for advertising purposes even before having obtained the consent of the users (absence of opt-in ), the use of the expression withdrawing consent by GIL is particularly abusive. Therefore, companies could at most put forward the fact of having put in place a mechanism of opposition to these cookies (opt-out ). 106. In addition, the restricted committee notes that it emerges from the online control of March 16, 2020 that when people clicked on the button Consult now on the information banner at the bottom of the google.fr page, a window appeared. where they could click the button Change ad settings , then turn off Google search and ad personalization web ad personalization with slide buttons. When people turned off ad personalization using this sliding button, a new window was displayed asking them to confirm their choice and telling them that ads will continue to appear but will no longer be personalized. 107. The restricted committee noted that after having nevertheless deactivated the personalization of ads on Google search, the delegation noted, while continuing to browse the site, that several of these cookies for advertising purposes remained stored on its terminal equipment. It emphasizes, in this regard, that at least one of these cookies did not belong to the category of so-called opposition cookies, which remain stored on the user's terminal with the value opt-out to indicate to the server of the domain to which they are linked that the user has expressed his refusal to future deposits of identical cookies from this same domain. 108. Since the company GIL itself acknowledged, in its letter of April 30, 2020, that the cookie in question pursues an exclusively advertising purpose, the restricted committee concluded that the opposition mechanism put in place by the companies was partially defective. . Indeed, since this cookie remains placed on the user's terminal without being assigned the value opt-out , the information it contained continued to be systematically read by the server of the domain to which the cookie is linked (for example google .com or google.fr) during each new interaction with the domain concerned. 109. In view of the foregoing, the restricted committee considers that the companies have disregarded the obligation provided for by article 82 of the Data Protection Act to set up an effective mechanism allowing users to refuse or no longer read cookies requiring their consent. III. On corrective measures and advertising 110. Under article 20, paragraph III, of the Data Protection Act: When the data controller or his subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from (...) this law, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms may also, if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, where applicable in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted committee with a view to pronouncing, after adversarial proceedings, one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 2 ° An injunction to bring the processing into conformity with the obligations resulting (…) from this law or to satisfy the requests presented by the data subject in order to exercise his rights, which may be accompanied, except in cases in the event that the processing is implemented by the State, a fine the amount of which may not exceed 100,000 € per day of delay from the date set by the restricted group; \[…\] 7 ° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the turnover. total worldwide annual business for the previous fiscal year, whichever is greater . Under the assumptions mentioned in 5 and 6 of article 83 of regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are raised, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted committee takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83. 111. Article 83 of the GDPR, as referred to in Article 20, paragraph III, of the Data Protection Act, provides: 1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 2. Depending on the specific characteristics of each case, administrative fines are imposed in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in Article 58 (2) (a) to (h) and (j). In deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the amount of the administrative fine, due account shall be taken in each individual case of the following: a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage they suffered; (b) whether the violation was committed willfully or negligently; c) any measure taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects; d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical and organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32; e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or processor; (f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the violation and mitigating any negative effects thereof; g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach; (h) how the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, including whether, and to what extent, the controller or processor notified the breach; (i) where measures referred to in Article 58 (2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the same purpose, compliance with those measures; (j) the application of codes of conduct approved under Article 40 or certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or indirectly, as a result of the violation. A. On the legality of the present sanctioning procedure 112. The companies claim, first of all, that there is nothing to justify the CNIL having directly initiated a sanction procedure against them without a formal notice having been sent to them beforehand. 113. They then argue that in view of the instability of the legal framework relating to cookies, the pronouncement of a financial penalty for the facts in question would violate the principle of legality of offenses and penalties, guaranteed in Article 8 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. They argue in particular that the characterization of the breaches is based on the application of guidelines, the meaning of which was not binding at the time of the online check of March 16, 2020, the CNIL having granted, in July 2019, a deadline of adaptation of twelve months from the publication of the guidelines of July 4, 2019 so that data controllers can comply with them. 114. In the first place , the restricted committee recalls that, in accordance with article 20 of the Data Protection Act, the president of the CNIL is not required to send a formal notice to a data controller before sending initiate a sanction procedure against him. It adds that the possibility of directly initiating a sanction procedure has been confirmed by the Council of State (see, in particular, CE, 4 Nov. 2020, req. N ° 433311, pt. 3). 115. Secondly , the restricted committee recalls, first of all, that the various branches of the breach alleged against the companies have as their sole legal basis the provisions of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act which transposed the provisions relating to cookies and trackers of the ePrivacy directive. It points out that if these requirements were formerly provided for in Article 32, paragraph II, of the same law, before the text was overhauled as a whole by Ordinance No. 2018-1125 of 12 December 2018, their content is remained unchanged since 2011. 116. The restricted committee then notes that on the basis of these provisions, it has already adopted several sanctioning decisions, sometimes concerning identical practices, some of which have moreover been made public (see, in this regard, deliberation n ° SAN-2016-204 of July 7, 2016 and deliberation n ° SAN-2017-006 of April 27, 2017). 117. The restricted committee emphasizes, finally, that although communications from the CNIL relating to cookies and tracers have recently undergone certain changes, the practices at the origin of the various branches of the breach alleged in this case by the two companies have been continuously considered non-compliant by the CNIL, whether by the first recommendation of 5 December 2013 or by the guidelines of 4 July 2019, in force on the date of the findings made by the CNIL delegation. It notes, for information, that the second recommendation and the latest version of the guidelines, which date from September 17, 2020 and were published on October 1, 2020, are also part of this continuity. In any event, as recalled above, non-compliant practices identified in the context of this procedure are assessed with regard to the Data Protection Act and not the guidelines or recommendations of the CNIL. 118. As regards more particularly the period of adaptation from the publication of the guidelines of 4 July 2019 invoked by the companies, the restricted committee notes that it is, in this case, inoperative, since the practices in question relate precisely to the obligations which the CNIL had taken care, in its press release published on its website on July 18, 2019, to specify that they remained enforceable against data controllers, by warning them that this adaptation period \[does will not prevent it\] from fully monitoring compliance with the other obligations which have not been modified and, if necessary, from adopting corrective measures to protect the privacy of Internet users. In particular, operators must respect the prior nature of consent to the deposit of tracers \[…\] and must provide a device for withdrawing consent that is easy to access and use . 119. Due to the permanence of the legal basis and the provisions with regard to which the breach is constituted and the consistency of the CNIL's position with regard to the practices which are the subject of this procedure, the restricted panel considers that the imposition of an administrative fine against each of the companies without prior notice would not contravene the principle of legality of offenses and penalties. B. On the pronouncement of administrative fines and their amount 120. The companies argue that the amount of the fine proposed by the rapporteur is disproportionate and estimated on a discretionary basis since, unlike other French or European administrative authorities with powers of sanction, the CNIL does not did not provide guidelines for calculating its fines. 121. They add that this amount should be significantly reduced, in particular in application of subparagraph f) of Article 83, paragraph 2 of the Regulation in order to take into account their strong cooperation with the CNIL since the start of the procedure with a view to put an end to the breach and mitigate any negative effects. 122. The restricted committee recalls, in general, that Article 20, paragraph III, of the Data Protection Act gives it competence to impose various penalties, in particular administrative fines, the maximum amount of which may be equivalent to 2% of the figure. total worldwide annual business for the previous financial year carried out by the data controller. It adds that the determination of the amount of these fines is assessed in the light of the criteria specified by article 83 of the GDPR. 123. In the first place, the restricted panel emphasizes that it is appropriate, in this case, to apply the criterion provided for in subparagraph a) of Article 83, paragraph 2 of the Regulations relating to the seriousness of the breach, taking into account the nature and scope of the processing. 124. Thus, the restricted panel notes that the search engine Google Search , from which the cookies in question are deposited, has a considerable impact in France, the Competition Authority having noted that it dominates the search market online with a market share of over 90% (ADLC, Dec. 19, 2019, Dec. n ° 19-D-26, pt. 313). 125. It emphasizes that the search engine Google Search counts at least 47 million users in France, which corresponds to 70% of the French population, the number of people concerned by the processing is extremely high. 126. With regard to the structuring of this market, the restricted party considers that the seriousness of the breach is characterized by the fact that by not respecting several of the requirements of article 82 of the Data Protection Act, companies deprive users Google Search residing in France the possibility of choosing between search methods which further preserve the confidentiality of their data and methods allowing better personalization of the service, thus reducing the informational autonomy and choice of people. 127. Finally, the restricted committee notes that the breach is all the more serious with regard to the role played by search engines in access to information, a fortiori by that developed by companies. In this regard, the power of this dominant position gives unparalleled value to cookies placed by companies from their search engine because they ensure third-party sites reach the maximum number of users and, in the case of tracking cookies, to be able to follow them with the greatest efficiency. 128. Secondly , the Panel considers that it is appropriate to apply the criterion provided for in subparagraph k) of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the Regulations relating to the financial advantages obtained as a result of the breach. 129. Thus, it emphasizes that the GOOGLE group achieves most of its profits in the two main segments of the online advertising market, display advertising namely (Display Advertising) and contextual advertising ( Search Advertising ), in which cookies play an undeniable, albeit different, role. 130. First, in the display advertising segment, the purpose of which is to display content in a specific area of ​​a website and in which cookies and trackers are used to identify users during from their browsing in order to offer them the most personalized content, it is established that the GOOGLE group offers products at all levels of the value chain in this segment and that its products are systematically dominant on these different levels. In this regard, the GOOGLE group indicates, on one of its websites, that it offers for advertising an ecosystem accessible from its tools and services capable of reaching more than 2 million sites, videos and applications and more than 90% of Internet users around the world. 131. Next, the segment of contextual advertising, the object of which is to display sponsored results based on the keywords typed by users in a search engine, also requires the use of cookies in its practical implementation. , for example in order to be able to determine the geographical location of users and, thereby, adapt the advertisements offered according to this location. In this regard, it emerges from the annual report of the company ALPHABET for the year 2019 that this segment alone, through in particular the service Google Ads - formerly AdWords - , 61% of the turnover of the GOOGLE group. 132. The restricted party is not aware of the amount of profit derived by the GOOGLE group from the collection and use of cookies on the French market via the income generated by advertising targeted to French Internet users, the companies placed in cause not having provided this information when they were invited to do so as part of the investigation of the case. As an order of magnitude, and in order to assess the proportionality of the amount of sanction proposed by the rapporteur, it notes that a proportional approximation based on publicly accessible figures would lead to estimate that France would contribute between 680 and 755 million dollars in the annual net income of ALPHABET, the parent company of the GOOGLE group, that is, at the current exchange rate, between 580 and 640 million euros. 133. Thirdly , as regards the criterion provided for in subparagraph f) of article 83, paragraph 2 of the Regulation invoked by the companies in support of a reduction in the fine proposed against them by the rapporteur , the restricted committee notes that it is clear from Article 18 of the Data Protection Act that data controllers cannot oppose the action of the Commission and that they must take all necessary measures to facilitate its task . Cooperation with the supervisory authority is therefore first and foremost an obligation provided for by law. 134. In order for this cooperation to possibly become a mitigating circumstance in the characterization of the breach and, thereby, contribute to the reduction of the fine initially envisaged, the restricted committee emphasizes that the data controller must not only have previously fulfilled its obligation under the aforementioned Article 18 but also to have complied particularly diligently with the requests of the supervisory authority during the investigation phase and implemented any measure in its power to minimize the impact of the breach on the persons concerned. 135. In the present case, the restricted committee notes that the companies in particular never communicated to the Commission services the advertising revenues of the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL made in France, financial information however requested on several occasions by the rapporteur, in upstream and following the hearing on July 22, 2020. Consequently, the cooperation they have shown should have no impact on the amount of their fine since it is barely in line with what the CNIL is. entitled to expect a data controller. 136. In conclusion, the restricted committee recalls that the breach of article 82 data processing and freedoms is in this case triply characterized, since by automatically depositing the cookies in question on the terminals of the users residing in France during their arrival on the google.fr page, the companies met neither the requirement of prior, clear and complete information to users, nor that of the compulsory collection of their consent and that, moreover, the opposition mechanism to these cookies turned out to be partially faulty. 137. It emphasizes that, due to the reach of the search engine Google Search in France, these practices have affected nearly fifty million users residing in France and that companies have derived considerable benefits from them through the advertising revenue indirectly generated. by the data collected by these cookies. 138. Pursuant to the provisions of article 20, paragraph III, of the Data Protection Act, companies incur a financial penalty of a maximum amount of 2% of their turnover, which was 38 billion euros. euros in 2018 for the company GIL and 160 billion dollars in 2019 for the company GOOGLE LLC. 139. Consequently, having regard to the respective responsibilities of the companies, their financial capacities and the relevant criteria of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the Rules mentioned above, the restricted panel considers that a fine of 60,000,000 euros against the company GOOGLE LLC and a fine of 40,000,000 euros against the company GIL appear to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the requirements of article 83, paragraph 1, of these Regulations. C. On the issuance of an injunction 140. The companies maintain that the requests formulated under the injunction proposed by the rapporteur and relating in particular to the information of individuals and the prior deposit of cookies subject to consent have become moot \[…\]. 141. They also dispute the amount of the daily penalty payment proposed in addition to the injunctions since the rapporteur does not demonstrate the need for this penalty or the proportionality of its amount, which is the maximum amount provided for by the Data Protection Act. 142. First of all , the Restricted Committee notes that in the current state of the information provided to users, companies still do not inform users residing in France, in a clear and complete manner, of the purposes of all cookies. subject to consent and the means at their disposal to refuse them, \[…\] It therefore considers it necessary to issue an injunction in order for companies to comply with the applicable obligations in this area. 143. Secondly , the restricted committee emphasizes that a daily fine is a financial penalty per day of delay that the controller will have to pay in the event of non-compliance with the injunction at the end of the planned execution period. . Its pronouncement may therefore sometimes be necessary to ensure the compliance of the data controller within a certain period. 144. The restricted committee adds that in order to keep the penalty payment its comminatory function, its amount must be both proportional to the seriousness of the alleged breaches but also adapted to the financial capacities of the data controller. It notes, moreover, that in certain cases, as in the present case, this amount must be all the higher as the breach concerned by the injunction indirectly contributes to the profits generated by the data controller. 145. In the light of these two elements, the Restricted Committee considers the imposition of a fine of 100,000 euros per day of delay to be proportionate and which can be liquidated at the end of a period of three months. The execution time allowed is also reasonable given the technical means at the disposal of the companies and the adaptability which they avail themselves of. D. On advertising 146. The restricted committee considers that the publication of this decision is justified in view of the seriousness of the breach in question, the scope of the processing and the number of people concerned. 147. The restricted committee considers that this measure will make it possible to alert French users of the search engine of Google Search the characterization of the breach of article 82 of the Data Protection Act in its various branches and to inform them of the persistence of the breach on the date of this deliberation and of the injunction pronounced against the companies to remedy it. It adds that this measure is made all the more necessary since the disputed cookies were placed without the knowledge of the users, so that only the publicity of this decision will enable them to become aware of the practices in question. 148. Finally, the measure is not disproportionate since the decision will no longer identify companies by name after the expiry of a period of two years from its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: · Pronounce against the company GOOGLE LLC an administrative fine in the amount of 60,000,000 euros (sixty million euros) for breach of article 82 of the Data Protection Act; · Pronounce against the company GOOGLE IRELAND LIMITED an administrative fine in the amount of 40,000,000 euros (forty million euros) for breach of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act; · Decide against companies GOOGLE GOOGLE IRELAND LIMITED LLC and an injunction to comply with treatment obligations of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act , in particular: o Inform the people concerned in advance and in a clear and complete manner, for example on the information banner on the home page of the google.fr site: - the purposes of all cookies subject to consent, - the means at their disposal to refuse them; · Match the injunction with a fine of 100,000 € (one hundred thousand euros) per day of delay at the end of a period of three months following the notification of this deliberation, the proof of the compliance having to be sent to the restricted group within this period; · Send this decision to GOOGLE FRANCE SARL for the execution of this decision; · Make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the companies by name after the expiration of a period of two years from its publication.

Facts and procedure 1. AMAZON EUROPE CORE (hereinafter referred to as the Company or AEC ) is a company governed by Luxembourg law, whose registered office is located at 5 rue Plaetis, L 2338 in Luxembourg, and which is part of the AMAZON Group. Its main activity is the operation of the European Amazon websites that allow the online sale of commercial goods. For the needs of its activities, particularly in France, the company operates the Amazon.fr website accessible from the URL address https://www.amazon.fr/. For the year 2019, it has achieved revenues of approximately 7.7 billion euros. 2. Pursuant to Decisions No. 2019-224C of November 29, 2019 and No. 2020-042C of December 27, 2019 of the President of the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (hereinafter the CNIL or the Commission), a delegation of the CNIL conducted the following control operations: - three online checks of the Amazon.fr website carried out on December 12, 2019, March 6, 2020 and May 19, 2020; - an inspection carried out on January 30, 2020 on the premises of AMAZON ONLINE France SAS, the French subsidiary of the AMAZON Group; - \[…\] 3. The purpose of these missions was to verify the company's compliance with the provisions of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, as amended, relating to information technology, files and freedoms (hereafter the ""Loi Informatique et Libertés"" or the Law of January 6, 1978). In particular, it was a question of carrying out investigations in connection with processing consisting of access or registration operations deposited on the terminal of Internet users residing in France during their visit to the Amazon.fr website. 4. During these investigations, several exchanges took place between AEC and AMAZON ONLINE France SAS on the one hand, and the CNIL control delegation on the other. 5. For the purposes of investigating these elements, the President of the Commission appointed Mr. Éric PÉRÈS as rapporteur on March 23, 2020, on the basis of Article 22 of the Law of January 6, 1978. 6. At the end of his investigation, the rapporteur had a bailiff serve a report on AEC, on July 17, 2020, detailing the breach of the Data Protection Act which he considered to have occurred in this case. Also attached to the report was a summons to the restricted session of October 15, 2020, indicating to the company that it could submit its observations in response by September 8, 2020 at the latest. 7. The report proposed to the Commission's restricted session to impose an administrative fine on AEC and an injunction, together with a penalty payment, to bring the processing into compliance with the provisions of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act. It also proposed that this decision be made public and that the company no longer be identified by name after a period of two years from its publication. 8. In a letter dated August 19, 2020, the Company requested that the chairman of the restricted session be granted an additional period of time to submit his observations in response to the rapporteur's report. On September 1, 2020, the chairman of the restricted session granted the company an additional period of one week. 9. On September 15, 2020, the Company, through its Board, filed comments in response to the Reporter's Report and requested that the restricted session before the Restricted Session be held in camera. The request was renewed on October 13, 2020. 10. 10. By e-mail dated September 24, 2020, pursuant to Article 40, paragraph 4, of Decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 implementing the French Data Protection Act (hereinafter the Decree of May 19, 2019), the rapporteur asked the chairman of the restricted session for an additional period of nine days to respond to the Company's observations, which was granted on September 28, 2020. The company was informed of this request on the same day. 11. On October 1, 2020, the Secretary General of the CNIL informed the Company that the restricted session initially scheduled for October 15 was postponed to November 12, 2020. 12. The rapporteur responded to the company's observations on October 9, 2020. 13. On October 22, 2020, the chairman of the restricted session granted the company's request for an in camera session on the grounds that \[...\] The company's request for an in camera session had not been complied with. 14. On November 2, 2020, the company submitted new observations in response to those of the rapporteur. 15. On November 4, 2020, the Company requested a postponement of the restricted session scheduled for November 12, 2020. By letter dated November 5, 2020, the chairman of the restricted session refused to grant the request. 16. 16. The Company and the rapporteur made oral submissions at the restricted session on November 12, 2020. 17. On November 17, 2020, the Company wrote to the chairman of the restricted session indicating that some of its representatives attending the session via videoconference were not able to hear all of the discussions between their boards and the rapporteur, \[...\]. II. Reasons for the decision A. On the competence of the CNIL 1. On the material competence of the CNIL and the applicability of the single window mechanism provided for by the RGPD 18. Under the terms of Article 16 of the French Data Protection Act, the restricted session takes measures and imposes sanctions against data controllers or subcontractors who do not comply with the obligations arising from \[...\] the present Act. Pursuant to Article 20, paragraph III, of the same law, where the data controller or its processor does not comply with the obligations arising from \[...\] the present law, the president of the National Commission for Data Processing and Liberties \[...\] may refer the matter to the restricted session for a ruling, after an adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures \[...\] 2° An injunction to bring the processing into conformity with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or from this Law or to comply with the requests made by the person concerned to exercise his rights, which may be accompanied, except in cases where the processing is implemented by the State, by a penalty payment not exceeding € 100,000 per day of delay from the date set by the restricted session; an administrative fine not exceeding €10 million or, in the case of an undertaking, 2% of its total worldwide annual turnover for the previous financial year, whichever is the higher. 19. Under Article 5(3) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (hereinafter the ePrivacy Directive ) Member States shall ensure that the storage of information, or obtaining access to information already stored in a subscriber's or user's terminal equipment shall only be allowed on condition that the subscriber or user has given his consent, after having received, in compliance with Directive 95/46/EC, clear and comprehensive information, inter alia, on the purposes of the processing \[...\]. 20. These provisions have been transposed into domestic law in Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act, in Chapter IV of this Act, relating to the rights and obligations specific to processing in the electronic communications sector. This article provides that any subscriber or user of an electronic communications service must be informed in a clear and complete manner, unless he has been previously informed by the controller or his representative: 1° Of the purpose of any action tending to access, by electronic transmission, information already stored in its electronic communications terminal equipment, or to enter information in this equipment ; 2° The means at his disposal to oppose it. Such access or registration may only take place on condition that the subscriber or user has expressed, after receiving this information, his or her consent, which may result from the appropriate parameters of his or her connection device or any other device under his or her control. These provisions shall not apply if the access to or registration of information stored in the user's terminal equipment : 1° Either, has the exclusive purpose of allowing or facilitating communication by electronic means ; 2° Or, is strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user. 21. The rapporteur considers that the CNIL is materially competent in application of these provisions to control and initiate a sanction procedure concerning the operations of access or registration of information implemented by the company in the terminals of the users of the Amazon.fr site in France. 22. The company AEC challenges the jurisdiction of the CNIL. It considers that only the Luxembourg data protection authority (Commission nationale pour la protection des données, hereinafter the CNPD) is competent to initiate a sanction procedure and possibly impose an administrative fine against it in the event of failure to comply with its obligations regarding cookies. 23. 23. The CNPD maintains first of all that its cookie practices must be examined in the context of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of personal data and on the free movement of such data (hereinafter RGPD) because of the close links between this text and the ePrivacy Directive. 24. In support of its argument, the company argues that the registration of cookies on users' terminals cannot be dissociated from the subsequent use of the data collected by these cookies for the purposes pursued by the data controller. \[…\]. 25. The Company also notes that both the decision of the President of the CNIL of November 29, 2019 to open an audit procedure and the correspondence exchanged with the CNIL in the context of these audits expressly mention that the purpose of the audits is to assess the compliance of the Company's practices with the DPGR. It also notes that the rapporteur himself used concepts from the RGPD in his sanction report when analyzing the consequences for users of the use of cookies. She also notes that the French legislator chose to transpose article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive not in a dedicated text, but directly in the French Data Protection Act, thus demonstrating the unity of the two subjects. 26. The company then considers that even in the event that the CNIL's investigations were to focus solely on the provisions of Article 82 of the Loi Informatique et Libertés, the mechanism for cooperation between supervisory authorities, known as the one-stop shop mechanism, provided for in Chapter VII of the Regulation, should apply and that, consequently, the CNIL would not be the competent authority to act as lead authority. Indeed, it considers that since the ePrivacy Directive does not provide for any rules of jurisdiction when a processing it regulates is cross-border, it is appropriate to apply those provided for by the RGPD, particularly in view of the fact that, since the entry into force of the RGPD, the references made by the ePrivacy Directive to the repealed Directive 95/46/EC should be understood as being made to the RGPD. 27. The Company also considers that the fact that certain Member States of the European Union have chosen to entrust the monitoring of compliance with the ePrivacy Directive to their telecommunications regulatory authority and not to their data protection authority is not an obstacle to the application of the one-stop-shop mechanism insofar as cooperation agreements between these different authorities have been signed in several Member States, thus allowing data protection authorities to participate in the one-stop-shop mechanism in situations involving provisions arising from the ePrivacy Directive. The Commission considers that any sanction imposed on it by the restricted session based on the infringement of the provisions of Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive would run counter to the principle of harmonization contained in Article 15a of the Directive, which provides that The competent national regulatory authorities may adopt measures to ensure effective cross-border cooperation in the enforcement of national laws adopted pursuant to this Directive and to create harmonised conditions for the provision of services involving cross-border data flows and the principle of freedom to provide services as contained in Article 56 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), according to which restrictions on the freedom to provide services within the Union are prohibited in respect of nationals of Member States established in a Member State other than that of the recipient of the service. 28. The restricted session notes, first of all, that the operations that are the subject of the present procedure are carried out in the context of the provision of publicly available electronic communications services on public communications networks and that they concern exclusively reading and writing actions on the terminal of Internet users located in France when they visit the Amazon.fr site, operations that take the form of depositing and reading cookies. 29. The restricted session reminds that such processing is governed by the provisions of the directive on privacy and electronic communication, commonly known as ePrivacy, and in particular by Article 5(3), which has been transposed into national law in Article 82 of the Data Protection Act. The restricted session notes, first of all, that it is clear from the provisions cited above that the French legislator has mandated the CNIL to ensure compliance by data controllers with the provisions of the ePrivacy Directive, in particular by entrusting it with the power to sanction any breach of this article. It underlines that this power was recognized by the Council of State in its decision Association des agences-conseils en communication of June 19, 2020 concerning CNIL deliberation no. 2019-093 adopting guidelines relating to the application of Article 82 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended to reading or writing operations in a user's terminal, since the latter noted that article 20 of this law gives its president \[of the CNIL\] the power to take corrective measures in the event of non-compliance with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/279 or its own provisions, as well as the possibility to refer the matter to the restricted session with a view to the sanctions that may be imposed (EC, 19 June 2020, req. 434684, pt. 3). 30. It then notes, secondly, that when a processing operation falls within both the material scope of the ePrivacy Directive and the material scope of the DPMR, reference should be made to the relevant provisions of the two texts which provide for their articulation. Thus, Article 1(2) of the ePrivacy Directive provides that the provisions of this Directive specify and supplement Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of personal data (hereinafter Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data), it being recalled that since the entry into force of the Regulation, references to the latter Directive should be understood as references to the DPMR, in accordance with Article 94 of the latter. Likewise, it follows from recital 173 of the GDPMR that this text explicitly provides that it is not applicable to the processing of personal data subject to specific obligations having the same objective \[of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms\] as laid down in Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, including the obligations incumbent on the controller and the rights of natural persons. This articulation was confirmed by the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter CJEU ) in its Planet decision49 of October 1, 2019 (CJEU, October 1, 2019, C-673/17, pt. 42). 31. In this respect, the restricted session notes that, contrary to what the company maintains, the ePrivacy Directive does indeed provide, for the specific obligations it entails, its own implementation and enforcement mechanism within its Article 15a. Thus, the first paragraph of this directive leaves Member States the competence to determine the sanctions regime, including criminal sanctions if necessary, applicable to violations of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this directive and take all necessary measures to ensure their implementation. The penalties thus provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and may be applied to cover the duration of the infringement, even if the infringement has subsequently been rectified, However, the rule laid down in Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive, according to which reading and writing operations must systematically be subject to the prior agreement of the user, after information, constitutes a special rule with regard to the RGPD since it prohibits the use of the legal bases mentioned in Article 6 that do not require the user's agreement in order to lawfully carry out these read and write operations on the terminal. The supervision of this rule is therefore a matter for the special control and sanction mechanism of the ePrivacy Directive and not for the data protection authorities and the EDPS under the DPMR. The French legislator has chosen to entrust this mission to the CNIL. 32. The restricted session notes, secondly, that the second paragraph of the same article obliges Member States to ensure that the competent national authority and, where appropriate, other national bodies have the power to order the cessation of the infringements referred to in paragraph 1. 33. The Commission considers that the latter provisions exclude as such the application of the one-stop-shop mechanism provided for in the RGPD to facts falling within the scope of the ePrivacy Directive. 34. It adds, moreover, that this exclusion is corroborated by the fact that Member States, which are free to determine the national authority competent to deal with violations of national provisions adopted pursuant to the ePrivacy Directive, may have conferred that competence on an authority other than their data protection authority, in this case their telecommunications regulatory authority. Therefore, insofar as the latter authorities are not part of the European Data Protection Committee (hereinafter EDPS), although this Committee plays an essential role in the consistency checking mechanism implemented in Chapter VII of the DPMR, it is in fact impossible to apply the one-stop shop to practices that may be sanctioned by national supervisory authorities that are not members of this Committee. 35. It stresses that the cooperation agreements between data protection authorities and telecommunications regulatory authorities in certain States invoked by the company, for example, in the Netherlands, Sweden or Hungary, are intended to establish cooperation at the national level between the various regulators in order to ensure the consistency of their doctrines when a processing operation falls within the material scope of both the DPMR and the ePrivacy Directive, but that they are not intended to involve the telecommunications regulatory authorities as such in the one-stop-shop mechanism provided for in Chapter VII of the DPMR. 36. Finally, the restricted session underlines that the EDPS, in his Opinion No 5/2019 of 12 March 2019 on the interactions between the ePrivacy Directive and the DPMR, considered that In accordance with Chapter VII of the DPMR, the cooperation and consistency checking mechanisms available to data protection authorities under the DPMR are relevant to the supervision of the application of the provisions of the DPMR. The mechanisms of the DPMR do not apply to the enforcement of the provisions of the ePrivacy Directive as such and that the authority or authorities designated as competent under the ePrivacy Directive by the Member States are exclusively responsible for the enforcement of the national provisions transposing the ePrivacy Directive that are applicable to that specific processing, including in cases where the processing of personal data falls within the material scope of both the DPMR and the ePrivacy Directive. 37. The restricted session also notes that the possible application of the one-stop-shop mechanism to a treatment governed by the ePrivacy Directive is the subject of numerous discussions in the context of the ePrivacy Regulation project that has been under negotiation for three years at the European level. Therefore, the very existence of these discussions confirms that, as it stands, the single window mechanism provided for by the RGPD is not applicable to matters governed by the current ePrivacy Directive. 38. It is therefore necessary to distinguish between, on the one hand, read and write operations on a terminal, which are governed by the provisions of article 82 of the Data Protection Act and for which the French legislator has entrusted the CNIL with a supervisory role and in particular the power to sanction any breach of this article and, on the other hand, the subsequent use of data collected through cookies, which is governed by the RGPD and may therefore, where appropriate, be subject to the one-stop-shop mechanism . 39. The restricted session also notes that the company has chosen to use a domain name in .fr, which is an extension designating the territorial space of France, enabling it to benefit from optimal visibility among French Internet users. 40. Finally, the restricted session notes that the references to the RGPD contained in certain documents communicated by the CNIL during the audit did not affect the legality of the procedure insofar as the audits were general in nature but the CNIL only intended to pursue, subsequently, breaches for which it has the power to impose sanctions, which were clearly indicated in the notification of grievances by the rapporteur and on which the company was able to present its observations under conditions that comply with the rights of the defense. 41. It follows from the foregoing that the one-stop-shop mechanism provided for by the RGPD is not applicable to the present procedure and that the CNIL is competent to control and initiate sanction proceedings concerning the reading and writing operations of cookies implemented by the company that fall within the scope of the ePrivacy Directive, provided that they are within its territorial jurisdiction. 2. On the territorial jurisdiction of the CNIL 42. The rule for the territorial application of the requirements provided for in Article 82 of the Data Protection Act is set out in Article 3, paragraph I, of the Data Protection Act, which provides as follows without prejudice, as regards processing operations falling within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, to the criteria provided for in Article 3 of that Regulation, all the provisions of this law apply to the processing of personal data carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor on French territory, whether or not the processing takes place in France . 43. The rapporteur considers that the CNIL is territorially competent in application of these provisions since the processing that is the subject of the present procedure, consisting of operations of access or registration of information in the terminal of users residing in France when using the Amazon.fr site, is carried out within the framework of the activities of the company AMAZON ONLINE France SAS, which constitutes the establishment on French territory of the company AEC, which is specifically responsible for the implementation of the cookies involved in this procedure, which it has not contested, moreover. 44. In defense, the company considers that the territorial jurisdiction of the CNIL is lacking in this case insofar as one of the conditions allowing the CNIL's action provided for in Article 3(I) of the French Data Protection Act, namely that relating to the fact that the processing of personal data must be carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of a data controller, is not met. It emphasizes that the company AMAZON ONLINE France SAS does not intervene in the deposit of cookies on users' terminals and that its business is to provide marketing solutions and advice to companies wishing to market their products in the Amazon.fr store as well as on third party sites. It also specifies that it is the company that places advertisements on third-party sites on behalf of its customers and not AMAZON ONLINE France SAS. 45. It thus considers that there is no indissociable link between, on the one hand, the activities of AMAZON ONLINE France SAS and, on the other hand, the deposit of cookies by AMAZON EUROPE CORE from the Amazon.fr website. 46. The restricted session reminds that by virtue of article 3 of the French Data Protection Act, the CNIL is competent to exercise its powers as soon as the two criteria provided for in this article are met, in this case, the existence of an establishment of the data controller on French territory and the existence of a processing carried out within the framework of the activities of this establishment. 47. The restricted session recalls that the ePrivacy Directive, adopted in 2002 and amended in 2006 and again in 2009, does not itself explicitly establish the rule of territorial application of the various transposition laws adopted by each Member State. However, this directive indicates that it specifies and completes Directive 95/46.EC, which provided at the time, in Article 4, that Each Member State shall apply the national provisions it adopts pursuant to this Directive to the processing of personal data where: a) processing is carried out in the course of the activities of an establishment of the controller in the territory of the Member State; if the same controller is established in the territory of several Member States, it must take the necessary measures to ensure that each of its establishments complies with the obligations laid down by the applicable national law. This rule for determining the national law applicable within the Union is no longer relevant for the application of the rules of the PGRD, which replaced Directive 95/46/EC and applies uniformly throughout the Union, but it is logical that the French legislator has maintained the criterion of territorial application for specific rules of French law, in particular those transposing the ePrivacy Directive . Consequently, the case law of the CJEU on the application of article 4 of the former Directive 95/46/EC remains relevant, insofar as the French legislator used these same criteria to define the territorial jurisdiction of the CNIL. 48. As regards, first of all, the existence of an establishment of the data controller on French territory, the CJEU, in its Weltimmo judgment of October 1, 2015, specified that the notion of establishment, within the meaning of Directive 95/46, extends to any real and effective activity, even a minimal one, carried out by means of a stable installation, the criterion of stability of the installation being examined with regard to the presence of human and technical means necessary for the provision of the concrete services in question. The CJEU considers that a company, an autonomous legal person, of the same group as the data controller, may constitute an establishment of the data controller within the meaning of these provisions (CJEU, 13 May 2014, Google Spain, C-131/12, pt 48). 49. In the present case, the restricted session notes first of all that the status of establishment of the company AMAZON ONLINE France SAS is not contested by the company. It then notes that this company has stable premises located in France, at 67 boulevard du général Leclerc in Clichy, in which approximately 120 people work. Consequently, it is indeed an establishment of AEC within the meaning of Article 3 of the aforementioned Data Protection Act. 50. 50. Secondly, with regard to the existence of processing carried out in the context of the activities of this establishment, the restricted session recalls that, in its Google Spain decision of May 13, 2014, the CJEU considered that the processing relating to the search engine Google Search was carried out in the context of the activities of the company Google Spain, an establishment of the company Google Inc. insofar as this company is intended to ensure the promotion and sale in Spain of the advertising spaces offered by this search engine, which serve to make the service offered by this engine profitable. It also stated that in order to ensure effective and complete protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, this concept should not be interpreted restrictively. While in the Google Spain judgment the institution responsible for the processing was established outside the European Union, the Court subsequently, in its judgment of June 5, 2018, applied the same broad interpretation of processing carried out in the context of the activities of a national institution to a situation where the processing was partly under the responsibility of another institution present within the European Union (CJEU, June 5, 2018, C-210/16, pts 53 sq). Finally, it should be noted that the interpretation of the notion of processing implemented in the context of the activities of a national establishment of the controller does not affect the fact that the debtor of the obligations remains the controller and, where appropriate, its processor. 51. The restricted session notes that the company AMAZON ONLINE France SAS presented itself to the delegation of control as offering digital marketing solutions to client companies, themselves providing products and services sold or not sold on the amazon.fr site to companies wishing to improve the visibility of their products on the web. In this context, it is required to ensure, as indicated by the company AEC during the audit, the promotion and marketing of advertising tools (Sponsored Ads and Amazon DSP) that are controlled and operated by the company Amazon Europe Core S.à.r.l., established in Luxembourg. However, these products developed by the company AEC operate in particular thanks to the data collected through cookies deposited on the terminals of Internet users. The restricted session thus notes that the company AMAZON ONLINE France SAS carries out an activity allowing to ensure in France the promotion and the marketing of the tools developed by the company AEC. The restricted session notes that the two criteria provided for in Article 3, paragraph I, of the French Data Protection Act are therefore met and that the processing is sufficiently territorialized in France to be subject to French law. The application of French law only concerns reading and writing operations that are carried out on French territory (Article 4 of Directive 95/46/EC also specified that the law of the Member State only applied to the activities of the establishment on the territory of the Member State), which corresponds to data read from or written to terminals in France. Finally, the restricted session emphasizes that this is a constant position on its part since the intervention of the Google Spain case law in 2014 (see in particular the decision CNIL, restricted session, 27 April 2017, SAN-2017-006; CNIL, restricted session, 19 December 2018, SAN-2018-011). 52. As a result, French law is applicable and the CNIL is materially and territorially competent to exercise its powers, including that of taking a sanction measure concerning the processing in question which falls within the scope of the ePrivacy Directive . The competence of the CNIL is limited to such processing carried out in the context of the activity of AMAZON ONLINE France SAS on French territory, namely the reading and writing operations carried out by the data controller on the terminals (computers, computers, etc.) located in France. \[…\] C. On the procedure 60. In defense, the company argues that the procedure followed by the CNIL violated its right to a fair trial as guaranteed by Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 61. In particular, the company complains that it answered the questions of the CNIL's supervisory delegation without the latter indicating the purpose and legal basis of the inspections carried out, with the result that its right not to participate in its own criminalization would have been violated. She also explains that the decision of the president of the CNIL appointing a rapporteur on March 23, 2020, which constitutes an indictment, was only notified to her by e-mail on May 13, 2020, thus delaying the preparation of her defense. 62. The Company then considers that the procedure followed by the CNIL is flawed insofar as the CNIL agents carried out an online inspection on May 19, 2020 on the basis of the inspection decision of the CNIL president of November 29, 2019, when a rapporteur had already been appointed. It also explains that the methodology followed by the delegation of the CNIL during this control, which aimed to reproduce the course of a Net surfer going to the Amazon.fr site from an advertising banner present on third party sites, does not make it possible to distinguish the cookies deposited by the third party sites from those deposited on the Amazon.fr site. a. On the respect of the right to a fair trial. 63. The restricted session recalls that the right not to participate in one's own criminalization and the right to have the time and facilities necessary for the preparation of one's defense invoked by the company are components of the right to a fair trial contained in Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and must, in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, be analyzed in light of their functions in the general context of the proceedings (see, among others, Mayzit v. Russia, January 20, 2005). 64. The restricted session notes, first of all, that under the terms of article 18 of the Data Protection Act, the persons questioned in the context of verifications carried out by the commission pursuant to g of 2° of I of article 8 are required to provide the information requested by the commission for the performance of its duties. Thus, the persons questioned by the CNIL delegation are required to respond to its requests in order to help it carry out its missions. 65. The restricted session then reminds that when the supervisory delegation requests information, in particular factual information, from an organization, no charges have yet been brought against it, so that the adversarial phase, as understood by the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, has not yet begun. 66. With regard to the notification to the body of the president's decision to appoint a rapporteur, the restricted session recalls that in application of article 39 of the decree of May 19, 2019, this appointment can only be made if a sanction is likely to be pronounced under III of article 20 of the French Data Protection Act. 67. It notes that under article 39 of the decree of May 19, 2019, it is precisely the responsibility of the rapporteur to take all necessary steps to determine whether or not the natural person or legal entity in question may be accused of breaches. It is for this reason that, in accordance with articles 8-2-g and 19 of Act no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended, the rapporteur has the right to carry out additional investigations or have them carried out before drafting his report. 68. The restricted session thus emphasizes that the decision to appoint a rapporteur does not include any grievance, so that this appointment is not intended, at this stage, to enable the company to understand what could possibly be reproached to it. It recalls that the grievances only take shape through the sanction report, which is equivalent to a notification of grievances, since it is this document that contains the breach or breaches that the rapporteur considers to have been committed. The two reports of the rapporteur explicitly indicated the legal basis of the breach. The restricted session also pointed out that the notification of this decision to the natural or legal person concerned is not subject to any time limit in the applicable texts. 69. The restricted session notes that the company has no grounds for claiming that it was not able to understand the scope of the CNIL's investigations. It notes in this respect that the inspection reports and their attachments, communicated to the Company after the inspections were carried out, clearly established the scope of the investigation carried out by the CNIL. It notes that among the attachments sent to the company were screenshots of the home page of the site where the information banner on cookies appears, as well as pages of information on cookies, but also the list of cookies whose registration on the terminal was noted. The restricted session also notes that when the minutes of the audit of March 6, 2020 were notified, the company was also asked to indicate, for each of the 46 cookies previously mentioned, their purpose (for example: technical, advertising, social network sharing button, audience measurement, etc.). 70 Finally, the restricted session recalls that Article 40 of Decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 provides that the natural or legal person to whom a report proposing a sanction is notified has a period of one month to submit its observations in response. In this case, this time limit was respected insofar as the company had an initial period of eight weeks to submit its initial observations on the rapporteur's report and that this period was extended by one week at its request. Consequently, the restricted session considers that the company was able to properly prepare its defense. 71. The company then had three weeks to respond to the rapporteur's second observations and was finally given the opportunity to make oral observations during the restricted session on November 12, 2020. 72. With regard to these elements, the restricted session considers that AEC's rights of defence have been respected. b. On the regularity of the May 19, 2020 online audit 73. The restricted session reminds that, in application of articles 8-2-g and 19 of the amended Act no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, the reporter has the possibility of asking CNIL agents to carry out checks. It emphasizes that in the case in point, the rapporteur wanted an online check to be carried out retracing two paths taken by users who visit the Amazon.fr site after clicking on an advertising link present on third-party sites. 74. The restricted session then considers that the fact that the minutes drawn up in the context of this control bears the reference of the control decision No. 2019-224C of November 29, 2019 of the President of the CNIL does not affect its validity insofar as the appointment of a rapporteur by the President of the CNIL does not in itself have the effect of closing the control procedure. Indeed, the audit of May 19, 2020 was carried out in the continuity of the audits preceding the appointment of the rapporteur and therefore in the extension of the decision of the President. 75. The restricted session notes that the cookies whose presence was noted by the delegation when arriving on the home page of the Amazon.fr site during the first two controls are also among those present when arriving on another page of the site in the event that the user accesses it via a third party site. Thus, the other cookies identified by the delegation are those registered by the third-party sites in question and are therefore not part of the scope of the investigations. Consequently, it considers that the findings made on May 19, 2020, compared to those made on December 12, 2019 and March 6, 2020, show without ambiguity which cookies are, on the one hand, deposited by third-party sites displaying an advertisement for an Amazon product and, on the other hand, those deposited when the user arrives on the Amazon.fr site after having clicked on the said advertisement. 76. In view of these elements, the restricted session considers that the online control of May 19, 2020 is not tainted by irregularities. D. On breaches of the provisions of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act (Loi Informatiques et Libertés) 77. As recalled in point 20, Article 82 of the Data Protection Act constitutes the transposition into domestic law of Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive. 78. The rapporteur considers that AEC's operations with regard to the deposit and reading of cookies present two sets of serious relative negligence: - The deposit of cookies on the user's terminal before any action on his part and without obtaining his consent; - the information delivered to the user regarding the operations of access or registration of information in their terminal. 79. The rapporteur considers that by placing cookies on the terminal of Internet users located in France who visit the Amazon.fr site before any action on their part, the company necessarily prevents the latter from validly expressing their consent. He reminds that the French Data Protection Act expressly provides that the operations of access or registration of information in the user's terminal, with certain exceptions, can only take place after the user has expressed his consent. 80. The rapporteur then considers that the information provided by the company on the home page of the Amazon.fr website by means of the information banner is insufficient in that it only constitutes a general and approximate description of the purposes of all cookies deposited and that it does not mention the means available to the Internet user to oppose the deposit of cookies. It adds that when the user goes to the Amazon.fr site not via the home page, but from an ad published on a third party site, cookies are deposited when the user arrives on the Amazon.fr site without any information being delivered. 81. In its defense, the company reminds that its practices with respect to cookies are subject to Luxembourg law and not to French law. It emphasizes that it has launched a vast project to overhaul its policy on the use of cookies as of 2019 and that these changes have been effective on the Amazon.fr site since September 2, 2020. It argues that in any event, its practices regarding cookies have always been in accordance with the provisions of Luxembourg law. 82. In this respect, while the company does not in itself dispute the fact that prior to the changes introduced in September 2020, cookies were deposited on the user's terminal as soon as he or she arrived on the page of the Amazon.fr site, it argues that insofar as Luxembourg law provides that consent may be expressed through the browser settings, it has always validly collected the consent of users. 83. With respect to the information provided to users, the company believes that even if the French Data Protection Act were applicable, the information it provided was, in any event, in compliance with the provisions of Article 82 of that Act. It points out that by clicking on the Learn more link in the information banner, the user was redirected to a page with information on its cookie policy. She explains that in the case of a user who comes to the Amazon.co.uk site via an advertisement posted on a third-party site, most of those advertisements include an AdChoices icon that takes the user to a page where the user can view information about its targeted advertising policy. 84. The Company further states that the vast majority of Internet users who click on Amazon advertisements are customers who have already visited or purchased from the site and therefore have already received information about its cookie policy. 85. The Company further states that its information system is supplemented by the presence at the bottom of the page of links to its pages dedicated to the cookie and targeted advertising sections. 86. Finally, the company points out that there is no common doctrine among all European regulators on the use of cookies and that it is therefore difficult for players to know what is expected of them in this area. It argues, through a comparative study, that the vast majority of French websites do not comply with the legislation in force. The company also points out the fact that when the CNIL's investigations were launched in November 2019, the recommendation on cookies and other tracers adopted on December 5, 2013 had already been repealed, which contributed to the legal vagueness of the rules on cookies. 87. First of all, with respect to the collection of consent, the restricted session emphasizes that it appears from the observations made by the delegation on December 12, 2019, March 6, 2020 and May 19, 2020 and from the information transmitted by the company that regardless of the user's path, whether the user goes to the home page of the Amazon.fr site or goes to a product page of the site via an ad, more than 40 cookies with an advertising purpose were placed on the user's terminal. 88. Cookies referred to as advertising cookies do not fall within the scope of the exceptions defined in Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act insofar as they are not intended to enable or facilitate communication by electronic means and are not strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user. Consequently, such cookies may not be deposited or read on the person's terminal as long as he or she has not provided his or her consent. 89. The restricted session observes that the information banner, written as follows : By using this site, you agree to our use of cookies to offer and improve our services. Read more , did not contain any specific information regarding the means available to users to express their choice regarding the registration of cookies. In any event, cookies were deposited before any action by the user, even if it was a simple continuation of navigation, which had been accepted as a valid means of expressing consent in a deliberation No. 2013-378 of December 5, 2013 of the CNIL (but which no longer corresponds to the state of law, informed by the deliberation No. 2020-091 of September 17, 2020 of the CNIL). 90. The restricted session considers that the company should have collected the prior consent of users before proceeding to deposit cookies for advertising purposes on their terminal. It notes that in any event, even though the browser settings may in some cases constitute a valid mechanism for collecting consent, it is on the condition that the user has been previously informed that he has this possibility, which is not the case here. 91. Moreover, the restricted session reminds you that, as indicated above, it is the Company's responsibility to comply with the provisions of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act when cookies are placed on user terminals located on French territory from the Amazon.fr site. 92. Secondly, the restricted session considers that the information provided by the company with respect to the operations of access or registration of cookies is, depending on the case, either incomplete or non-existent. 93. It recalls that both Article 5-3 of the ePrivacy Directive and Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act expressly provide that the user must be fully informed of the purposes pursued by the operations of depositing and reading cookies and the means at his disposal to oppose them. 94. However, the restricted session notes that the aforementioned information banner displayed on the home page only contained a general and approximate description of the purposes of the set of cookies deposited. On this point, it considers that the terms offer and improve our services only allow the user to be informed that cookies are registered in order to allow the company to ensure the proper functioning of its activity and to make it evolve. Thus, when reading this banner, the user is not able to understand the type of content and ads that can be personalized according to his or her behavior. 95. In addition, the information banner does not mention the means available to the Internet user to refuse the registration of cookies. 96. The restricted session further notes that the company's failure to provide information to individuals is even more apparent when the user comes to the Amazon.co.uk site through an advertisement posted on a third-party site, for example, after clicking on a link in a search engine results list or an advertisement on a third-party site promoting a product sold on the Amazon.co.uk site. 97. The observations made by the CNIL delegation show that, in this hypothesis, cookies for advertising purposes were in fact placed on the terminals of users located on French territory without any information being provided to them. However, the provisions of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act provide that such access or registration may only take place on condition that the subscriber or user has expressed his or her consent after receiving this information (emphasis added). The restricted session considers that this situation is particularly prejudicial to the rights of users located on French territory insofar as the company places cookies on their terminal without ever having informed them. 98. The restricted session considers that the observations presented by the company in defense do not allow the existence of this breach to be called into question. 99. First of all, the Company cannot hide behind the fact that certain advertisements displayed on third-party sites contain an Adchoices icon that users can click on to view a page informing them of the Company's cookie policy. In fact, beyond the fact that this device only concerns Internet users coming from a third party site on which an advertisement with an Adchoices icon is displayed, the restricted session considers that it cannot reasonably be expected of the user to whom an advertisement is presented to have the reflex to click on a small icon before clicking on the advertisement itself. Moreover, this icon does not allow people watching the advertisement to know that information relating to cookies is available if they click on it. 100 In any event, the restricted session notes that the page to which the Adchoices icon refers simply allows the user to check a box so that Amazon will no longer display ads based on their interests. This page does not contain any information about the purpose of the actions taken by the user to enter information into his or her terminal equipment and the means available to him or her to oppose such actions. Finally, no information is provided as to the user's right to refuse cookies, but simply a link to the Cookies page of the site. Such a device does not meet the requirements of the aforementioned article 82. 101. The restricted session also recalls that the CNIL has adopted several soft law legal instruments detailing the obligations of data controllers with regard to tracers, including, in particular, a recommendation of December 5, 2013 and guidelines of July 4, 2019, in force on the date of the online control. Although these instruments are not mandatory, they provide useful information to data controllers by informing them of the implementation of concrete measures to ensure compliance with the provisions of the French Data Protection Act relating to tracers, so that they can either implement these measures or implement measures with equivalent effect. 102. In this respect, in article 2 of its 2013 recommendation, the Commission recalled in particular that the information must be prior to the collection of consent, but must also be visible, obvious and complete. Consequently, the Commission recommended that data controllers implement a two-stage consent collection mechanism: - first stage: the Internet user who goes on the site of a publisher (home page or secondary page of the site) must be informed, by the appearance of a banner: of the precise purposes of the cookies used; of the possibility of opposing these cookies and of changing the parameters by clicking on a link present in the banner; - second stage: persons must be informed in a simple and intelligible manner of the solutions available to them to accept or refuse all or part of the cookies requiring consent: for all the technologies referred to in Article 32-II above; by categories of purposes: in particular advertising, social network buttons and audience measurement. 103. Such recommendations were included in the guidelines of July 4, 2019, in equivalent terms. 104. Second, the restricted session considers that the company's argument that the vast majority of people who click on an Amazon advertisement have already visited or purchased a product on the Amazon.co.uk site and therefore have previously received cookie registration information is not operative. 105. The restricted session indeed notes that before becoming customers, these persons necessarily had to visit the site for the first time, either via the home page or after clicking on an advertising banner. However, the findings of the CNIL show that during their very first visit to the site, Internet users are either insufficiently informed or are never informed of the registration of cookies and that whatever the level of information received, cookies are systematically registered on their terminal. Moreover, the alleged circumstance that the practices of other websites do not comply with the requirements of Article 82 does not affect the company's obligations. 106. Similarly, the restricted session considers that the Cookies links present at the foot of the page and which refer to a page of information do not constitute a satisfactory method of information since the deposit of cookies before any action of the user necessarily deprives the information of its prior nature, contrary to the provisions of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, according to which Such access or registration can only take place if the subscriber or user has expressed, after having received this information, his consent (emphasis added). 107. Finally, the restricted session reminds that although the recommendations on cookies have evolved, the practices reproached to the company have continually been considered as non-compliant by the CNIL and this was confirmed in the guidelines of July 4, 2019 and that this position remains unchanged in its second recommendation and in the latest version of the guidelines which do not call this state of affairs into question. 108. The restricted session further notes that in its press release published on its website on July 18, 2019, which provided for a moratorium before the effective application of its second recommendation on cookies, the CNIL had been careful to specify that it would continue to monitor compliance with the obligations that had not been modified in any way, indicating that In particular, operators must respect the prior nature of consent to the deposit of tracers \[... and\] must provide a device for withdrawing consent that is easy to access and use. Thus, the company cannot validly argue that the obligations of which it is accused of being unaware in the present procedure were not clearly identified. 109. The restricted session specifies that, moreover, the breach alleged against the company is not based on a lack of knowledge of the guidelines or recommendations of the CNIL but on a lack of knowledge of the provisions of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, which only contain obligations that were already included in the previous versions of the said Act. 110. 110. The restricted session also notes that on the basis of these provisions, it has already adopted several sanction decisions, sometimes concerning identical practices, some of which have been made public (see, in this regard, deliberation no. SAN-2016-204 of July 7, 2016 and deliberation no. SAN-2017-006 of April 27, 2017). 111. In light of these elements, the restricted session considers that the breach of the provisions of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act is characterized by the fact that the company places cookies on the terminal of users located on French territory before collecting their consent and without providing them with the information prescribed by this article, under the conditions it defines. III. On the pronouncement of corrective measures and advertising 112. Article 20 of Law no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended provides that: when the controller or its processor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or the present law, the president of the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés may \[...\] refer the matter to the restricted session of the commission with a view to the pronouncement, after an adversarial procedure, of one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 2° An injunction to bring the processing into conformity with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or from this Law or to comply with the requests made by the data subject to exercise his rights, which may be accompanied, except in cases where the processing is implemented by the State, by a penalty payment not exceeding €100,000 per day of delay from the date set by the restricted session; \[...\]. 7° Except in cases where the treatment is implemented by the State, an administrative fine may not exceed 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the total annual worldwide turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher. In the cases referred to in Article 83 (5) and (6) of EU Regulation 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased to 20 million euros and 4% of said revenue, respectively. The restricted session takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same Article 83. 113. Article 83 of the RGPD, as referred to in Article 20(III) of the Data Protection Act, provides that : 1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the administrative fines imposed under this Article for violations of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 2. 2. Depending on the specific features of each case, administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). In deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the amount of the administrative fine, due account shall be taken, in each individual case, of the following elements : a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the violation, taking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage they have suffered ; (b) whether the breach was committed intentionally or through negligence ; (c) any measure taken by the controller or the processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects ; (d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical and organisational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32; (e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or processor ; (f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach and mitigating its possible negative effects ; (g) the categories of personal data concerned by the breach; (h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether and to what extent the controller or processor notified the breach; (i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the same purpose, compliance with those measures ; (j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or certification schemes approved pursuant to Article 42; and (k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstances applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, as a result of the violation. A. On the imposition of an administrative fine 114 In defense, the company argues that the amount of the fine proposed by the rapporteur is disproportionate and that the rapporteur failed to take into account several criteria set out in Article 83(2) of the Regulation, including the fact that a user information system was in place, the lack of intent to commit the breach, the measures taken to mitigate the damage or the absence of previous violations. It argues that it is not possible, in order to determine the amount of the fine, to take into account the processing carried out using cookies because these elements are not part of the scope of the CNIL's investigations. Finally, it notes that the fine proposed by the rapporteur is out of proportion with the fines imposed by other authorities in relation to cookies. 115. In light of the elements developed above, the restricted session considers that the aforementioned facts, which constitute a breach of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act, justify the imposition of an administrative fine against AEC, the legal entity responsible for the processing. It recalls that the changes made by the company to the Amazon.fr site since September 2020 have no impact on the imposition of a fine insofar as the fine is intended to punish the facts observed during the controls. 116. The restricted session recalls, as a general rule, that Article 20, paragraph III of the French Data Protection Act gives it the power to impose various sanctions, including an administrative fine, the maximum amount of which may be equivalent to 2% of the total annual worldwide turnover of the previous financial year of the data controller. It adds that the determination of the amount of this fine is assessed in the light of the criteria specified by article 83 of the RGPD. 117. In the case in point, the restricted session considers that the breach in question justifies the imposition of an administrative fine against the company for the following reasons. 118. First of all, the restricted session notes that the breach committed is particularly serious in so far as, by placing cookies on the terminals of users located in France prior to any action on their part, without providing them with the necessary information, the company deprives them of the possibility of exercising their choice in accordance with the provisions of Article 82 referred to above. 119. The restricted session considers that the seriousness of the breach is accentuated in the case of French users who access the Amazon.fr site after clicking on an ad in a search engine or on a third-party site. Indeed, given that the deposit of cookies is carried out in this context in the absence of any information from the persons concerned, it is thus carried out without their knowledge. 120. The restricted session observes that the seriousness of the breach must also be assessed with regard to the scope of the reading and writing operations and the number of persons concerned. 121. With respect to the scope of the reading and writing operations, the restricted session notes that the visit of an Internet user to the Amazon.fr site results in the filing of cookies by twenty or so companies specializing in personalized advertising, the purpose of which is to track the user's navigation on the Web so that advertising corresponding to his or her behavior can be displayed later. 122. 122. It considers that it is appropriate to take into account the extent of the processing that will be carried out thanks to the prior deposit of cookies on the terminals of users residing in France and the imperative need for the latter to maintain control over their data. In this sense, users must be put in a position to be sufficiently informed of the scope of the processing implemented. 123. With respect to the number of persons concerned, information provided by the company shows that approximately 300 million AMAZON identifiers were assigned in France over a nine-month period. The restricted session notes that even if a single person is likely to correspond to several different identifiers due to the use of multiple terminals and browsers, this volume reflects the central place occupied by the Amazon.fr site in the daily lives of people residing in France. The information that may be collected for a single identifier using these advertising cookies is also numerous, varied, and sometimes related to aspects affecting the privacy of individuals, and it is not impossible that some may reveal information corresponding to sensitive data (religious opinions, politics, state of health, etc.) governed by Article 9 of the RGPD. 124 Secondly, the restricted session considers that the company AEC, which in 2019 had a worldwide turnover of approximately 7.7 billion euros, derived a clear financial benefit from the breach. Indeed, as recalled in point 121, the use of cookies allows the company to present users, when they browse other sites, personalized advertisements promoting its products. The restricted session notes that if the company's main activity lies in the sale of consumer goods, the personalization of advertisements, made possible in particular by cookies, makes it possible to considerably increase the visibility of these goods and to increase the likelihood that they will be purchased. However, by not delivering clear and complete information to users and by placing cookies before individuals consent, the company eliminates the risk that these cookies will be refused. 125 It follows from all of the foregoing and the criteria duly taken into account by the restricted session, in view of the maximum amount incurred established on the basis of 2% of revenues, that an administrative fine of 35 million euros is warranted. B. On the pronouncement of an injunction accompanied by a penalty payment 126. The rapporteur proposes, in addition to the administrative fine, that an injunction be issued with a penalty payment of 100,000 euros in that the company does not inform users of the exact purposes of the registration of cookies and the means available to them to oppose them. 127. In defense, the company argues that this injunction is unjustified insofar as, on the one hand, it has already changed its practices and, on the other hand, the amount proposed is disproportionate. It recalls that no more cookies are deposited before the user has expressed his consent. It also notes that the pronouncement of an injunction on this point may come up against the publication by the CNIL of its new guidelines and recommendations on cookies. It stresses that it would be forced to undertake two series of changes, the first to comply with the injunction and the second to implement the new recommendations of the CNIL. 128. The restricted session notes that since receiving the sanction report, the company has made changes to the Amazon.fr site. It notes first of all that regardless of the path by which the user goes to the site, no more cookies are deposited on his terminal before he has expressed his consent. 129. It then notes that upon arrival on the site, regardless of the path followed by the user, the banner displayed contains the following text: Choose your cookie preferences. We use cookies and similar tools to facilitate your purchases, to provide our services, to understand how customers use our services so that we can make improvements, and to present advertisements. Approved third parties also use these tools as part of our ad display. This banner also contains two buttons, Accept Cookies and Personalize Cookies . 130. 130. The restricted session nevertheless considers that this new device still does not deliver clear and complete information as provided for in Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act . 131. The restricted session observes that the information provided still does not allow Internet users to understand precisely some of the purposes pursued by the deposit of cookies, in particular advertising purposes, whereas the latter are used largely to offer them personalized advertising based on their behavior. 132. Consequently, without ignoring the steps taken by the Company to comply with the provisions of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act, the restricted session considers that it has not demonstrated, at the closing date of the investigation, its compliance with the provisions of the aforementioned article and that it is therefore appropriate to issue an injunction on this point. 133. With regard to the amount of the daily penalty, the restricted session recalls that it is a financial penalty per day of delay that the controller will have to pay in the event of non-compliance with the injunction at the end of the execution period provided for. 134. 134. In order to keep the on-call duty in its comminatory function, its amount must be both proportionate to the seriousness of the alleged breach but also adapted to the financial capacities of the data controller. It should also be taken into account that the breach in question indirectly contributes to the profits generated by the controller. In the light of these elements, the restricted session considers that a penalty payment of EUR 100 000 per day of delay from the notification of this Decision appears proportionate. 135. 135. With regard to the period of time granted to the company to comply with the injunction, the restricted session considers that a period of three months from the notification of this decision is sufficient to regularize the situation. C On the publicity of the decision \[…\] 137. The restricted session considers that, in view of what has been stated above, it is justified to impose an additional sanction of advertising. Account is also taken of the predominant place occupied by the company in the field of online commerce, the seriousness of the breaches and the interest that this decision represents for informing the public, in determining the duration of its publication. \[…\] FOR THESE REASONS The restricted session of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to : - impose an administrative fine of 35 (thirty-five) million euros on AMAZON EUROPE CORE; - 35 (thirty-five million euros); to issue an injunction to bring the processing in conformity, within three months from the notification of this decision, with the provisions of article 82 of the French Data Protection Act, and in particular : - inform the persons concerned beforehand in a clear and complete manner, for example by means of an information banner appearing at the time of the first arrival of the Internet user on the Amazon.fr site, regardless of the first page accessed: - the precise purposes of all cookies whose registration is subject to consent - as well as the means at their disposal to refuse them; - attach to the injunction a penalty payment of 100,000 (one hundred thousand) euros per day of delay, with proof of compliance to be sent to the restricted session within this period; - to send this decision to the company AMAZON ONLINE France SAS with a view to its execution; - to make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its decision, which will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. The Chairman Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be appealed before the Council of State within four months of its notification."

Facts and procedure Mr. \[...\] exercises a liberal activity \[...\] in Paris \[...\]. On \[…\], the \[…\] website, reported free access to medical imaging computer servers located \[…\] allowing consultation and downloading \[…\] of medical images (MRI, radios, scanners, etc…) followed in particular by surname, first name, date of birth and date of consultation of patients. In application of the decision n ° 2019-152C of September 20, 2019 of the President of the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms (hereinafter the CNIL or the Commission), the services of the CNIL carried out a control in line, September 20 and 24, 2019, which confirmed the freely accessible nature of this data, which can be used through a simple medical image consultation software. The check also made it possible to establish a list of the IP addresses of these servers which are located in France. The purpose of this control was in particular to verify that the beneficiaries of these IP addresses complied with all the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter the Regulation or the RGPD) and law n o 78-17 of 6 January 1978 relating to computers, files and liberties (hereinafter the data Protection Act). After asking the various Internet service providers to provide them with the identity and contact details of the data controllers using these French IP addresses, the CNIL services were informed that one of these addresses, bearing the number \[ ...\], was awarded Mr. \[...\]. By e-mail of October 8, 2019, the control delegation notified Mr. \[...\] of the online control, after having informed him of the freely accessible nature of the medical images of his patients from the IP address of his server. By e-mail of October 9, Mr. \[...\] replied that he had taken the necessary steps to put an end to the violation. On December 6, 2019, Mr. \[...\] was interviewed by the control delegation on the premises of the CNIL. He indicated that in order to be able to remotely access the medical images stored in the hard drive of the fixed computer at his home, he opened the ports of the LiveBox used at his home by activating the latter's DMZ mode, in the goal of making the VPN work . For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission appointed Mr. François PELLEGRINI as rapporteur, on July 27, 2020, on the basis of Article 22 of the Data Protection Act. At the end of his investigation, the rapporteur had Mr. \[...\] personally delivered, on September 23, 2020, a report detailing the breaches of the GDPR that he considered constituted in this case. On the same day, the CNIL services notified him of an invitation to the restricted training session on December 3, 2020. This report proposed to the restricted formation of the Commission to pronounce an administrative fine against Mr. \[...\] for breaches of Articles 32 and 33 of the Rules. On November 20, 2020, Mr. \[...\] requested, through his counsel, the postponement of the session of the restricted formation. This request was rejected on November 26, 2020 by the president of the restricted formation. The counsel for Mr \[...\] and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the session of the restricted formation. II.Reasons for the decision A. On the breach of the obligation to ensure the security of the data processed 14. Pursuant to Article 32 (1) of the GDPR, the controller implements the appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee a level of security adapted to the risk . 15. The a) and b) of this same paragraph 1 provide that depending in particular on the scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks for the data subjects, the data controller implements the encryption of the data. of a personal nature and the means to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and continued resilience of processing systems and services . 16. The rapporteur argues that the vulnerability of the medical imaging device at the origin of the data breach is attributable to Mr \[...\] who did not implement the appropriate technical measures to guarantee security processing. 17. The counsel for M. \[...\] replies that his client had no desire to allow free access to these medical images and that the violation is only the unfortunate consequence of the connection to his Internet box on the hard drive. external connected to his home computer. 18. The restricted committee notes that, pursuant to article 32 of the GDPR, it was up to M. \[...\], as data controller, to ensure the security of the data that he processed in the context of of his professional activity. 19. First of all , the restricted committee emphasizes that it is not disputed that the data breach was caused by the opening of the network ports of the Internet box used at Mr.'s home \[...\] coupled with the configuration of the imaging software server function \[...\]. 20. It notes that in his email of 9 December 2019, Mr. \[...\] indicated: it so happens that this software \[the imaging software \[...\]\] includes a server function, that the mac is behind a LiveBox connected to the Internet and that (…) I think the 11112 port of the LiveBox is open to all winds. In addition, during his hearing on December 6, 2019, the latter specified that he had not had recourse to a service provider for the installation and configuration of the software \[...\] and had himself opened the ports of the LiveBox used at home (…) with the aim of making the VPN work . 21. It therefore emerges from these elements that Mr. \[...\] did not take care to limit the network functions to those which were strictly necessary for the processing to function. 22. However, the restricted committee emphasizes that the protection of the internal computer network and the encryption of personal data are part of the elementary requirements in terms of computer security, which are incumbent on any data controller. 23. In this regard, in the guide The security of personal data, which provides useful information to data controllers as to the measures to be implemented in order to guarantee the security of their processing, the Commission recommends authorizing only network functions. necessary for the treatments implemented. Likewise, the Practical Guide for physicians , published by the CNIL in consultation with the National Council of the Order of Physicians, invites physicians to limit as much as possible the connection of non-professional devices to the network within which are treated. patient data, as well as using strong authentication means to access this network. 24. Next, the restricted panel stresses that it also emerges from the hearing of 6 December 2019 that Mr. \[...\] had not taken care to encrypt the data contained in his three laptops and in his computer either. desktop. 25. However, in the absence of encryption, the medical data contained in the hard disk of these computers could be read in clear by any person taking possession of these devices (for example, following their loss or their theft) or by any person entering improperly on the network to which these devices were connected. 26. In this regard, in its guide The security of personal data, the CNIL recommends providing means of encryption for nomadic workstations and mobile storage media (laptop, USB keys, external hard drive, CD-R, DVD-RW , etc.), for example via encryption of the entire hard disk when the operating system offers it, file-by-file encryption or the creation of encrypted containers (file that may contain several files). Likewise, the Practical Guide for Physicians invites physicians to encrypt their patient data with appropriate software. 27. Finally , the restricted committee notes that the processing in question concerns medical data, which constitute special categories of personal data, within the meaning of Article 9 of the Regulations. The nature of this information therefore called for special vigilance in order to avoid a data breach. 28. The restricted committee thus recalls that among the data concerned by the violation, there appeared, in addition to the medical images, the surname, first names and date of birth of the patient, the date of the examination, the name of the referring practitioner and of the patient. practitioner who carried out the examination and the name of the establishment in which it took place. 29. She stresses that it emerges from Mr. \[...\] 's own statements in the context of his hearing on December 6, 2019 that more than five thousand three hundred sets of medical images are concerned. 30. Lastly, it notes that the file shows that these data were disclosed for approximately four months. 31. In view of all of these elements, the restricted committee considers that a breach of Article 32 of the GDPR has occurred. B. On the failure to notify the data breach to the CNIL 32. Pursuant to Article 33 (1) of the GDPR, in the event of a personal data breach, the controller shall notify the breach in question to the competent supervisory authority in accordance with Article 55, as soon as possible and, if possible, 72 hours at the latest after becoming aware of it. 33. The rapporteur argues that Mr \[...\] did not report the data breach to the relevant Commission services. 34. Mr \[...\] replied that the need to notify the data breach to the Commission was never indicated to him. He also invokes the artificial nature of such an obligation once he has been made aware of the free access to his medical imaging server by the CNIL control delegation. 35. The restricted committee considers that the data controller must comply with the notification requirement provided for in article 33 of the Regulation, unless the violation in question is not likely to create a risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. . The fact that the data breach was brought to the attention of M. \[...\] by the CNIL's control service did not release him from this obligation. 36. In fact, following the control, the data controller may become aware of additional elements relating to the data breach which deserve to be communicated to the competent services of the CNIL, whose mission in particular is to centralize the various breaches of the data. data and monitor it in order to prevent the compromise of personal data. A teleservice is available on the CNIL website to make these notifications. 37. In the present case, the restricted panel recalls that the existence and nature of the notification obligation appeared in the email of 8 October 2019 which informed Mr. \[...\] of said data breach. 38. The restricted panel therefore considers that there has been a breach of article 33 of the Rules. III.On corrective measures and publicity 39. Under the terms of III of article 20 of the Data Protection Act: When the data controller or his subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or from this law, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms may also, if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, if necessary in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted committee with a view to pronouncing, after adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 7 ° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the worldwide annual turnover total for the previous financial year, whichever is higher. In the hypotheses mentioned in 5 and 6 of article 83 of regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are raised, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted committee takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83. 40. Article 83 of the GDPR provides: 1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this Article for violations of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 2. Depending on the specific characteristics of each case, administrative fines are imposed in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in Article 58 (2) (a) to (h) and (j). In deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the amount of the administrative fine, due account shall be taken, in each individual case, of the following: (a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage they suffered; (b) whether the violation was committed willfully or negligently; c) any measure taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects; d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical and organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32; e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or processor; (f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach and mitigating any negative effects thereof; g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach; (h) how the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, including whether and to what extent the controller or processor notified the breach; (i) where measures referred to in Article 58 (2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the same purpose, compliance with those measures; (j) the application of codes of conduct approved under Article 40 or certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or indirectly, as a result of the violation. 41. Regarding the pronouncement of an administrative fine , counsel for Mr. \[...\] considers in particular that the corrective measure proposed by the rapporteur is disproportionate with regard to his responsibility for the data breach and that the pronouncement of a call to order would be more justified. 42. He also claims that he reacted very quickly to put an end to the violation, as soon as he became aware of it by the delegation, and asserts his full cooperation with the Commission services. 43. The restricted committee recalls that in order to assess the advisability of pronouncing an administrative fine, it is necessary to refer to the relevant criteria specified by Article 83, paragraph 2, of the GDPR. 44. In the present case, it considers that it is appropriate to first apply the criterion provided for in subparagraph f) of article 83, paragraph 2, of the Regulations relating to the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority. monitoring with a view to remedying the violation and mitigating any negative effects. 45. The restricted panel notes that as soon as he learned of the violation, Mr. \[...\] immediately took the necessary measures to put an end to it immediately. 46. ​​It thus recalls that in its email of October 9, 2019 in response to the delegation of control, Mr. \[...\] indicated that he had deactivated the server function of the software and blocked the unnecessary ports on the Livebox . 47. However, the restricted panel underlines that the criteria provided for in subparagraphs a) and g) of article 83, paragraph 2, of the Rules relating, on the one hand, to the nature and seriousness and the duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and on the other hand, the categories of personal data affected by the breach. 48. It thus notes that Mr. \[...\] has failed in two elementary principles in terms of computer security, namely the protection of the internal computer network by limiting network flows to what is strictly necessary and the encryption of personal data. . 49. The restricted formation again underlines that the seriousness of the breach of article 32 of the GDPR is all the more characterized as health data is concerned and that this particular category of personal data must benefit from reinforced security measures. , in accordance with recital 75 of the GDPR. 50. It repeats that the non-respect of these elementary practices had the direct consequence of making accessible more than five thousand three hundred series of health images comprising, for each of these series, in addition to the medical image, the names, first names and date of birth of each patient, the date of the examination, the name of the referring practitioner and of the practitioner who performed the examination and the name of the establishment in which it took place. 51. It recalls that the personal data housed on the hard drive of the fixed computer at Mr's home \[...\] remained accessible without any authentication for a period of approximately four months. 52. Finally, the restricted panel underlines that it is also appropriate to apply the criterion provided for in subparagraph h) of article 83, paragraph 2 of the Regulation relating to the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the violation, including whether and to what extent the controller notified the violation. 53. It recalls in this case that the Commission learned of the data breach through a press article and that Mr ... never notified it to the competent Commission services, even after the delegation of control has drawn its attention to this point. 54. In the light of these elements, the restricted committee considers it necessary to issue an administrative fine against Mr. \[...\]. 55. Regarding the determination of the amount of this fine , the restricted committee considers that the breach of Article 32 of the GDPR is of certain seriousness, that, on the other hand, the breach of Article 33 is of a formal nature in this case. 56. She noted that according to the statements of her counsel at the meeting of December 3, 2020, Mr. \[...\] received € 97,000 in income in 2018 and that pursuant to the provisions of Article 83, paragraph 4, of the GDPR, it incurs a financial penalty of a maximum amount of 10 million euros. 57. Consequently, having regard to Mr \[...\] financial capacities and the relevant criteria of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the Rules, the Restricted Committee considers that the pronouncement of a fine of € 3,000 appears to be both effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the requirements of Article 83, paragraph 1, of this Regulation. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: pronounce against Mr. \[...\] an administrative fine in the amount of € 3,000 (three thousand euros) for breaches of Articles 32 and 33 of the GDPR; make this decision public on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website without identifying the data controller. President Alexandre linden This decision may be appealed against to the Council of State within two months of its notification."

En application de la décision n° 2019-152C du 20 septembre 2019 de la présidente de la Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés (ci-après la CNIL ou la Commission), les services de la CNIL ont procédé à un contrôle en ligne, les 20 et 24 septembre 2019, qui a confirmé le caractère librement accessible de ces données, exploitables par l’intermédiaire d’un simple logiciel de consultation d’images médicales. Le contrôle a également permis d’établir la liste des adresses IP de ces serveurs qui sont localisées en France. Ces missions avaient notamment pour objet de vérifier le respect, par les attributaires de ces adresses IP, de l’ensemble des dispositions du règlement (UE) 2016/679 du Parlement européen et du Conseil du 27 avril 2016 (ci-après le Règlement ou le RGPD ) et de la loi no 78-17 du 6 janvier 1978 modifiée relative à l’informatique, aux fichiers et aux libertés (ci-après la loi informatique et libertés ).

Par un courrier électronique du 2 octobre 2019, la délégation de contrôle a notifié le contrôle en ligne à M. \[...\], après l’avoir informé du caractère librement accessible des images médicales de ses patients à partir de l’adresse IP de son serveur. Par un courrier électronique du même jour, M. \[...\] a répondu avoir pris les mesures nécessaires pour mettre fin à la violation. Le 17 décembre 2019, M. \[...\], assisté de son conseil, a été auditionné par la délégation de contrôle dans les locaux de la CNIL. Il a indiqué avoir, en 2015, paramétré son logiciel d’imagerie \[...\] pour pouvoir transférer automatiquement des images issues de son équipement de radiographie vers la base de données de son logiciel d’imagerie hébergée dans son cabinet et accéder à distance aux images. Par courrier du 7 janvier 2020, M. \[...\] a fait parvenir à la délégation de contrôle plusieurs documents sollicités dans le cadre de son audition, tels que la volumétrie des images contenues dans la base de données du logiciel d’imagerie médicale ainsi que les registres des traitements de données à caractère personnel mis en œuvre dans son cabinet. Par courrier du 20 janvier 2020, M. \[...\] a fait parvenir à la délégation de contrôle des documents rendant compte du renforcement des mesures de sécurité apportées au dispositif d’imagerie médicale de son cabinet. Aux fins d’instruction de ces éléments, la présidente de la Commission a désigné M. François PELLEGRINI en qualité de rapporteur, le 27 juillet 2020, sur le fondement de l’article 22 de la loi informatique et libertés . À l’issue de son instruction, le rapporteur a fait remettre en main propre à M. \[...\], le 23 septembre 2020, un rapport détaillant les manquements au RGPD qu’il estimait constitués en l’espèce. Le même jour, les services de la CNIL ont notifié à ce dernier une convocation à la séance de la formation restreinte du 3 décembre 2020. Ce rapport proposait à la formation restreinte de la Commission de prononcer une amende administrative à l’encontre de M. \[...\] au titre de manquements aux articles 32 et 33 du Règlement. Le 22 octobre 2020, par l’intermédiaire de son conseil, M. \[...\] a produit des observations et formulé une demande pour que la séance devant la formation restreinte se tienne à huis clos. Le 29 octobre 2020, le président de la formation restreinte a fait droit à cette demande au motif que les données à caractère personnel versées au débat étaient protégées par le secret médical. M. \[...\] et le rapporteur ont présenté des observations orales lors de la séance de la formation restreinte. II.Motifs de la décision A.Sur le manquement à l’obligation d’assurer la sécurité des données traitées 17. Aux termes de l’article 32, paragraphe 1, du RGPD, le responsable du traitement met en œuvre les mesures techniques et organisationnelles appropriées afin de garantir un niveau de sécurité adapté au risque . 18. Les a) et b) de ce même paragraphe 1 prévoient qu’en fonction notamment de la portée, du contexte et des finalités du traitement ainsi que des risques pour les personnes concernées, le responsable de traitement met en œuvre le chiffrement des données à caractère personnel et des moyens permettant de garantir la confidentialité, l'intégrité, la disponibilité et la résilience constantes des systèmes et des services de traitement . 19. Le rapporteur fait valoir que la vulnérabilité du dispositif d’imagerie médicale à l’origine de la violation de données est imputable à M. \[...\] qui n’a pas mis en œuvre les mesures techniques appropriées pour garantir la sécurité du traitement. 20. M. \[...\] répond notamment n’être pas à l’origine de la violation de données dès lors que le paramétrage de la box Internet, qui sert de routeur à son matériel informatique professionnel, a selon lui été effectué par des prestataires externes au cabinet. Il reconnaît toutefois ne pas être en mesure de prouver la matérialité de ces interventions, n’en n’ayant conservé aucun compte rendu. 21. La formation restreinte relève qu’en application de l’article 32 du RGPD, c’est à M. \[...\] qu’il incombait, en tant que responsable de traitement, de veiller à la sécurité des données qu’il traitait, la détermination de l’auteur du paramétrage de la box Internet étant inopérante en l’espèce. 22. Tout d’abord, la formation restreinte souligne qu’il n’est pas contesté que la violation de données a pour cause l’ouverture des ports réseaux de la box Internet utilisée au cabinet de M. \[...\] couplée au paramétrage de la fonction serveur ( PACS ) du logiciel d’imagerie \[...\]. 23. Elle relève que dans son courrier électronique du 2 octobre 2019, M. \[...\] a indiqué : Je ne me sers pas d’un PACS au cabinet car nous visionnons directement les clichés réalisés sur le réseau Ethernet sécurisé . Par ailleurs, dans le cadre de son audition du 17 décembre 2019, il a précisé avoir mis en œuvre l’accès à distance aux images en 2015 et n’avoir pas eu recours à un prestataire pour l’installation et le paramétrage du logiciel \[...\] . Il ressort donc de ces éléments que M. \[...\] n’avait pas pris soin de limiter les fonctions réseaux à celles qui étaient strictement nécessaires au fonctionnement du traitement. 24. Or, la formation restreinte souligne que la protection du réseau informatique interne et le chiffrement des données à caractère personnel font partie des exigences élémentaires en matière de sécurité informatique, qui incombent à tout responsable de traitement. A cet égard, dans le guide La sécurité des données personnelles , qui offre un éclairage utile aux responsables de traitement quant aux mesures à mettre en œuvre afin de garantir la sécurité de leur traitement, la Commission recommande d’ autoriser uniquement les fonctions réseau nécessaires aux traitements mis en place . De même, le Guide pratique pour les médecins , publié par la CNIL en concertation avec le Conseil national de l’ordre des médecins, invite les médecins à limiter le plus possible la connexion d’appareils non professionnels sur le réseau au sein duquel sont traitées les données des patients, ainsi qu’à recourir à des moyens d’authentification forte pour accéder à ce réseau. 25. Ensuite, la formation restreinte souligne qu’il ressort également de l’audition du 17 décembre 2019 que M. \[...\] n’avait pas non plus pris soin de chiffrer les données contenues dans son ordinateur portable personnel, estimant que le chiffrement ralentit trop l’exécution des applications (dossier médical, outil de visualisation des images) . 26. Or, en l’absence de chiffrement, les données médicales contenues dans le disque dur de cet ordinateur étaient lisibles en clair par toute personne prenant possession de cet appareil (par exemple, à la suite de sa perte ou de son vol) ou par toute personne s’introduisant de manière indue sur le réseau auquel cet ordinateur était raccordé. 27. A cet égard, dans son guide La sécurité des données personnelles , la CNIL recommande de prévoir des moyens de chiffrement des postes nomades et supports de stockage mobiles (ordinateur portable, clés USB, disque dur externes, CD-R, DVD-RW, etc.), par exemple via le chiffrement du disque dur dans sa totalité lorsque le système d’exploitation le propose, le chiffrement fichier par fichier ou la création de conteneurs (fichier susceptible de contenir plusieurs fichiers) chiffrés. De même, le Guide pratique pour les médecins invite les médecins à procéder au chiffrement des données de leurs patients avec un logiciel adapté. 28. Enfin, la formation restreinte relève que le traitement en cause concerne des données médicales, qui constituent des catégories particulières de données à caractère personnel, au sens de l’article 9 du Règlement. La nature de ces informations appelait donc une vigilance toute particulière afin d’éviter une violation de données. 29. Elle rappelle ainsi que parmi les données concernées par la violation figuraient, outre l’image médicale, les nom, prénoms et date de naissance du patient, la date de réalisation de l’examen, le nom du praticien référent et du praticien ayant réalisé l’examen et le nom de l’établissement dans lequel l’examen a eu lieu. 30. Elle souligne qu’il ressort des propres déclarations de M. \[...\] dans le cadre de son audition du 17 décembre 2019 que plus de mille deux cents séries d’images médicales sont concernées. 31. Enfin, elle relève qu’il ressort du dossier que ces données ont été exposées environ cinq ans. 32. Au regard de l’ensemble de ces éléments, la formation restreinte considère qu’un manquement à l’article 32 du RGPD est constitué. B.Sur le manquement à l’obligation de notifier la violation de données à la CNIL 33. Aux termes de l’article 33, paragraphe 1, du RGPD, en cas de violation de données à caractère personnel, le responsable du traitement en notifie la violation en question à l'autorité de contrôle compétente conformément à l'article 55, dans les meilleurs délais et, si possible, 72 heures au plus tard après en avoir pris connaissance . 34. Le rapporteur fait valoir que le M. \[...\] n’a pas déclaré la violation de données auprès des services compétents de la Commission. 35. M. \[...\] répond que la nécessité de notifier la violation de données à la Commission ne lui a jamais été indiquée. Il invoque, par ailleurs, le caractère artificiel d’une telle obligation dès lors qu’il a eu connaissance du libre accès de la base de données de son logiciel d’imagerie médicale par la délégation de contrôle de la CNIL. 36. La formation restreinte considère que le responsable de traitement doit, en toute circonstance, respecter l’exigence de notification prévue à l’article 33 du Règlement à moins que la violation en question ne soit pas susceptible d'engendrer un risque pour les droits et libertés des personnes physiques. La circonstance que la violation de données avait été portée à la connaissance de M. \[...\] par le service des contrôles de la CNIL ne le déchargeait pas de cette obligation. 37. En effet, consécutivement au contrôle, le responsable de traitement peut avoir connaissance d’éléments complémentaires relatifs à la violation de données qui méritent d’être communiqués aux services compétents de la CNIL, lesquels ont notamment pour mission de centraliser les différentes violations de données et d’en assurer le suivi afin de prévenir la compromission de données à caractère personnel. Un téléservice est disponible sur le site de la CNIL pour effectuer ces notifications. 38. En l’espèce, la formation restreinte rappelle que l’existence et la nature de l’obligation de notification figuraient dans le courrier électronique du 2 octobre 2019 qui informait M. \[...\] de ladite violation de données. 39. La formation restreinte relève qu’au 24 septembre 2020, jour de la notification du rapport de sanction, M. \[...\] n’avait toujours pas notifié la violation de données à la Commission, alors qu’il en avait connaissance depuis le 2 octobre 2019. 40. La formation restreinte considère donc qu’un manquement à l’article 33 du Règlement est constitué. III.Sur les mesures correctrices et la publicité 41. Aux termes du III de l’article 20 de la loi informatique et libertés : Lorsque le responsable de traitement ou son sous-traitant ne respecte pas les obligations résultant du règlement (UE) 2016/679 du 27 avril 2016 ou de la présente loi, le président de la Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés peut également, le cas échéant après lui avoir adressé l'avertissement prévu au I du présent article ou, le cas échéant en complément d'une mise en demeure prévue au II, saisir la formation restreinte de la commission en vue du prononcé, après procédure contradictoire, de l'une ou de plusieurs des mesures suivantes : \[…\] 7° À l'exception des cas où le traitement est mis en œuvre par l'État, une amende administrative ne pouvant excéder 10 millions d'euros ou, s'agissant d'une entreprise, 2 % du chiffre d'affaires annuel mondial total de l'exercice précédent, le montant le plus élevé étant retenu. Dans les hypothèses mentionnées aux 5 et 6 de l'article 83 du règlement (UE) 2016/679 du 27 avril 2016, ces plafonds sont portés, respectivement, à 20 millions d'euros et 4 % dudit chiffre d'affaires. La formation restreinte prend en compte, dans la détermination du montant de l'amende, les critères précisés au même article 83. 42. L’article 83 du RGPD prévoit : 1. Chaque autorité de contrôle veille à ce que les amendes administratives imposées en vertu du présent article pour des violations du présent règlement visées aux paragraphes 4, 5 et 6 soient, dans chaque cas, effectives, proportionnées et dissuasives. 2. Selon les caractéristiques propres à chaque cas, les amendes administratives sont imposées en complément ou à la place des mesures visées à l'article 58, paragraphe 2, points a) à h), et j). Pour décider s'il y a lieu d'imposer une amende administrative et pour décider du montant de l'amende administrative, il est dûment tenu compte, dans chaque cas d'espèce, des éléments suivants : a) la nature, la gravité et la durée de la violation, compte tenu de la nature, de la portée ou de la finalité du traitement concerné, ainsi que du nombre de personnes concernées affectées et le niveau de dommage qu'elles ont subi ; b) le fait que la violation a été commise délibérément ou par négligence ; c) toute mesure prise par le responsable du traitement ou le sous-traitant pour atténuer le dommage subi par les personnes concernées ; d) le degré de responsabilité du responsable du traitement ou du sous-traitant, compte tenu des mesures techniques et organisationnelles qu'ils ont mises en œuvre en vertu des articles 25 et 32 ; e) toute violation pertinente commise précédemment par le responsable du traitement ou le sous-traitant ; f) le degré de coopération établi avec l'autorité de contrôle en vue de remédier à la violation et d'en atténuer les éventuels effets négatifs ; g) les catégories de données à caractère personnel concernées par la violation ; h) la manière dont l'autorité de contrôle a eu connaissance de la violation, notamment si, et dans quelle mesure, le responsable du traitement ou le sous-traitant a notifié la violation ; i) lorsque des mesures visées à l'article 58, paragraphe 2, ont été précédemment ordonnées à l'encontre du responsable du traitement ou du sous-traitant concerné pour le même objet, le respect de ces mesures ; j) l'application de codes de conduite approuvés en application de l'article 40 ou de mécanismes de certification approuvés en application de l'article 42 ; et k) toute autre circonstance aggravante ou atténuante applicable aux circonstances de l'espèce, telle que les avantages financiers obtenus ou les pertes évitées, directement ou indirectement, du fait de la violation. 43. Concernant le prononcé d’une amende administrative, M. \[...\] estime notamment que la mesure correctrice proposée par le rapporteur est disproportionnée au regard de sa responsabilité dans la violation de données. 44. Il revendique également le fait d’avoir réagi très rapidement pour mettre un terme à la violation dès qu’il en a eu connaissance par la délégation, et souligne qu’il s’est, pour cela, entouré de spécialistes compétents. 45. Il fait valoir, en outre, avoir mis en œuvre de nombreuses mesures de sécurité avant l’audition et souligne sa pleine coopération avec les services de la Commission. 46. La formation restreinte rappelle que pour apprécier l’opportunité de prononcer une amende administrative il convient de se référer aux critères pertinents précisés par l’article 83, paragraphe 2, du RGPD. 47. En l’espèce, elle estime qu’il convient de faire d’abord application du critère prévu à l’alinéa f) de l’article 83, paragraphe 2, du Règlement relatif au degré de coopération établi avec l'autorité de contrôle en vue de remédier à la violation et d'en atténuer les éventuels effets négatifs. 48. La formation restreinte relève que dès qu’il a eu connaissance de la violation, M. \[...\] a pris les mesures nécessaires permettant d’y mettre un terme aussitôt. 49. Elle rappelle ainsi que dans son courrier électronique du 2 octobre 2019 en réponse à la délégation de contrôle, M. \[...\] a indiqué avoir fait supprimer purement et simplement ce PACS logiciel dès la réception de votre appel et avoir écrit une procédure interne pour éviter qu’à l’avenir un prestataire n’ouvre un port ou un PACS sur le serveur et qu’il soit possible de se connecter dessus comme vous semblez avoir pu le faire . 50. Elle souligne également qu’il s’est, par la suite, entouré de prestataires, dont la société \[…\], afin de renforcer les mesures de sécurité apportées au dispositif d’imagerie médicale du cabinet, à travers notamment le chiffrement du disque dur de démarrage et l’installation d’un certificat SSL destiné au serveur web du logiciel \[...\]. 51. Cependant, la formation restreinte souligne qu’il convient de faire également application des critères prévu aux alinéas a) et g) de l’article 83, paragraphe 2, du Règlement relatifs, d’une part, à la nature, la gravité et la durée de la violation, compte tenu de la nature, de la portée ou de la finalité du traitement concerné, ainsi que du nombre de personnes concernées affectées et d’autre part, aux catégories de données à caractère personnel concernées par la violation. 52. Elle relève ainsi que M. \[...\] a failli à deux principes élémentaires en matière de sécurité informatique, à savoir la protection du réseau informatique interne par la limitation des flux réseau au strict nécessaire et le chiffrement des données à caractère personnel. 53. La formation restreinte souligne à nouveau que la gravité du manquement à l’article 32 du RGPD est d’autant plus caractérisée que des données de santé sont concernées et que cette catégorie particulière de données à caractère personnel doit bénéficier de mesures de sécurité renforcées, conformément au considérant 75 du RGPD. 54. Elle répète que le non-respect de ces pratiques élémentaires a eu pour conséquence directe de rendre accessibles plus de mille deux cents séries de données de santé comprenant, pour chacune de ces séries, outre l’image médicale, les nom, prénoms et date de naissance de chaque patient, la date de réalisation de l’examen, le nom du praticien référent et du praticien ayant réalisé l’examen et le nom de l’établissement dans lequel l’examen a eu lieu. 55. Elle rappelle que les données à caractère personnel hébergées sur la base de données du logiciel d’images \[...\] sont restées accessibles sans aucune authentification pendant une durée d’un peu moins de cinq ans, prolongeant de la sorte le risque que des tiers non autorisés accèdent aux données et puissent éventuellement les compromettre. 56. Enfin, la formation restreinte souligne qu’il convient également de faire application du critère prévu à l’alinéa h) de l’article 83, paragraphe 2, du Règlement relatif à la manière dont l'autorité de contrôle a eu connaissance de la violation, notamment si, et dans quelle mesure, le responsable du traitement a notifié la violation. 57. Elle rappelle en l’occurrence que la Commission a eu connaissance de la violation de données par le biais d’un article de presse et que M. \[...\] ne l’a jamais notifiée aux services compétents de la Commission, même après que la délégation de contrôle a attiré son attention sur ce point. 58. Au regard de ces éléments, la formation restreinte considère donc nécessaire le prononcé d’une amende administrative à l’encontre de M. \[...\]. 59. Concernant la détermination du montant de cette amende, la formation restreinte considère que le manquement à l’article 32 du RGPD présente une gravité certaine, qu’en revanche le manquement à l’article 33 présente en l’espèce un caractère formel. 60. Elle note que selon ses déclarations lors de la séance du 3 décembre 2020, M. \[...\] indique gagner environ 8 000 € par mois et qu’en application des dispositions de l’article 83, paragraphe 4, du RGPD, il encourt une sanction financière d’un montant maximum de 10 millions d’euros. 61. Dès lors, au regard des capacités financières de M. \[...\] et des critères pertinents de l’article 83, paragraphe 2, du Règlement, la formation restreinte estime que le prononcé d’une amende de 6 000 € apparaît à la fois effectif, proportionné et dissuasif, conformément aux exigences de l’article 83, paragraphe 1, de ce Règlement. PAR CES MOTIFS La formation restreinte de la CNIL, après en avoir délibéré, décide de : prononcer à l’encontre de M. \[...\] une amende administrative d’un montant de 6 000 € (six mille euros) pour les manquements aux articles 32 et 33 du RGPD ; rendre publique cette décision sur le site de la CNIL et sur le site de Légifrance sans identifier le responsable de traitement.

The NESTOR company having had the floor last; The restricted committee adopted the following decision: I. Facts and procedure The company NESTOR SAS (hereinafter the company) is a simplified joint stock company created in February 2015, whose activity is the preparation and delivery of meals to office workers, ordered from the company's website. nestorparis.com and a mobile application. Its head office is located at 113, rue Victor Hugo in Levallois-Perret (92300). In 2018, NESTOR SAS achieved a turnover of around \[…\] euros and a negative net result of around \[…\] euros. In 2019, the company achieved a turnover of approximately \[…\] euros and a negative net result of approximately \[…\] euros. NESTOR employs approximately 74 people. On May 14, 2019, the company had 169,768 customer accounts created via its site and its mobile application. In November 2018 and January 2019, the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms (hereinafter the CNIL or the Commission) received four complaints from people who are not clients of the company, indicating that they had received prospecting emails from by the latter without their having provided their prior consent (referrals no. \[…\], \[…\], \[…\] and \[…\]). These emails contained information relating to commercial offers and menus offered by the company. Some complainants informed the CNIL that the company had told them that it had reconstituted their e-mail address, in order to contact them, on the basis of the format of their company's e-mail address from the data disseminated on the company's professional social network \[... \]. Furthermore, a complainant indicated that she encountered difficulties in objecting to the processing of her personal data by the company for the purposes of prospecting by electronic mail (referral no. \[…\]). Several complainants also indicated that despite their unsubscription from the newsletter received by email, they continued to receive prospecting messages through this means. Finally, two complainants indicated that they had unsuccessfully requested from the company a copy of the personal data concerning them processed by it, as well as several information relating to the purpose of the processing, to the recipients of the data, to the retention periods. data or the source of their data (referrals no. \[…\] and \[…\]). On May 3, 2019, in application of the decision no 2019-082C of the president of the CNIL, a delegation of the CNIL carried out an online control mission, on the website and the mobile application implemented by the society. The purpose of this mission was to verify that this company complied with all the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter the Regulation or the GDPR) and of the Law n ° 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter the law of January 6, 1978 as amended or the Data Protection Act). During this control mission, the delegation followed the registration process of a person on the website as well as on the company's mobile application and created an account in the name of the CNIL. It thus carried out checks in relation to the data entered by the persons when they registered, the information relating to the protection of personal data provided to the persons concerned as well as the security measures put in place by the company with regard to passwords associated with the accounts. On May 14, 2019, a delegation from the CNIL carried out a control mission on the company's premises, in application of the aforementioned decision n ° 2019-082C. During this check, the company told the delegation that it was redesigning its website in order to comply with the GDPR, in particular with regard to informing individuals and the means of opposition to the receipt of the newsletter. The company also explained to the delegation how they build their prospect database. Finally, verifications were carried out with regard to the follow-up to complaints submitted to the CNIL, with regard to the rights of access and opposition of individuals. In response to a request of June 21, 2019, the company provided the CNIL control delegation, by email of the following July 3, with information relating to the source of the personal data contained in its prospect database. Finally, by email of September 11, 2019, the company provided the CNIL with information relating to the legal basis of the processing carried out for the purposes of commercial prospecting, the right of opposition as well as the retention periods for the data of prospects and customers. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission appointed Mr. François PELLEGRINI as rapporteur, on December 19, 2019, on the basis of article 22 of the law of January 6, 1978 amended in the version applicable to day of designation. On February 20, 2020, in order to update the findings already made, a CNIL delegation carried out a new online control mission of the nestorparis.com site and the company's mobile application. The Delegation again created an account on behalf of the Commission, on the website and mobile application, and carried out checks on the transparency of the information provided to individuals as well as the strength of the passwords associated with accounts. At the end of his investigation, the rapporteur notified the company NESTOR SAS, on February 28, 2020, of a report detailing the breaches of the GDPR that he considered constituted in this case. This report proposed to the restricted formation of the Commission to issue an injunction to bring the processing into line with the provisions of Articles L. 34-5 of the Postal and Electronic Communications Code (hereinafter the CPCE) and 12, 13, 15 and 32 of the Rules, accompanied by a fine of five hundred euros per day of delay at the end of a period of three months following the notification of the deliberation of the restricted formation, as well as an administrative fine. He also proposed that this decision be made public and no longer make it possible to identify the company by name after a period of two years from its publication. Also attached to the report was a notice to attend the restricted training session of May 7, 2020 indicating to the company that it had one month to communicate its written observations in application of the provisions of article 40 of the decree. n ° 2019-536 of May 29, 2019. On March 11, 2020, through its council, NESTOR requested by reasoned letter, a deadline to produce its observations. By email of March 18, 2020, the president of the restricted formation informed the company NESTOR that it could produce its defense observations until April 20, 2020. April 8, 2020, by virtue of order n ° 2020-306 of March 25, 2020 relating to the extension of deadlines expired during the period of health emergency and to the adaptation of procedures during this same period, taken in application of emergency law n ° 2020-290 of 23 March 2020 to deal with the Covid-19 epidemic, the president of the restricted formation informed the company that it had additional time to submit its observations to the rapporteur's report, until August 24, 2020. On August 21, 2020, through its counsel, the company filed comments. The rapporteur replied on the following September 18. On September 10, 2020, the Commission services sent the company a notice to attend the restricted training session on November 5, 2020. By email of August 25, 2020, on the basis of article 40, paragraph 4, of decree n ° 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 taken for the application of the Data Protection Act (hereinafter the decree of 19 May 2019), the rapporteur asked the chairman of the restricted formation for an additional fifteen days to respond to the company's observations, which was granted to him on August 27, 2020. The company was informed on the same day. On October 16, the company produced further submissions in response to those of the rapporteur. The company and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the restricted training session on November 5, 2020. II.Reasons for the decision A. On the regularity of the procedure 1.On the complaint alleging the lack of powers of the restricted panel The company considers that the restricted formation only has the power to pronounce the measures referred to in article 20 III of the Data Protection Act in the presence of persistent breaches. First, it maintains that this analysis follows from the interpretation of the terms of the law, Article 20 III of the Data Protection Act providing for the possibility for the restricted training to have recourse to the measures provided for in the aforementioned article. when the data controller or his subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or from this law. The rapporteur maintains that the interpretation of article 20 III of the Data Protection Act presented by the company cannot be followed. The legislator intended to allow the restricted formation of the CNIL to pronounce a sanction, in particular pecuniary, including in the event of breach duly noted but for which a formal notice would be pointless, the breach having ceased and no longer calling for correction. . The restricted committee considers that the measures taken by a data controller to put an end to a noted breach, if they justify that no formal notice or no injunction be sent to it for the future, do not deprive it of the possibility of pronouncing a corrective measure, and in particular an administrative fine, insofar as the compliance of the controller does not have the effect of eliminating the existence of past breaches. It emphasizes that this interpretation of article 20 of the Data Protection Act is in line with the RGPD in that this article aims at the accountability of data controllers. The corrective measures falling under the powers of the CNIL's restricted formation can be taken directly in all cases, whether or not the breach may still be brought into conformity or not. Recital 148 of the GDPR specifies that any violation of this Regulation may be subject to sanctions: In order to strengthen the application of the rules of this Regulation, sanctions including administrative fines should be imposed for any violation of this Regulation, in addition to or instead of the appropriate measures imposed by the supervisory authority under this Regulation. \[…\]. However, due account should be taken of the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, the intentional nature of the breach and the measures taken to mitigate the damage suffered, the degree of liability or any relevant breach previously committed, the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the violation \[…\]. The criterion of duration of the breach therefore applies to both a completed and a persistent breach. In addition, the restricted formation observes that the Council of State adopted this interpretation by recalling that: It follows from these provisions, clarified by the preparatory work of the law of October 7, 2016, that the restricted formation of the CNIL can, without prior notice, sanction a data controller whose breaches of obligations incumbent on him are not likely to be rectified, either they cannot be rectified, or they have already been remedied. (CE, n ° 423559, April 17, 2019, Association for the development of stoves). Secondly, the company maintains that the absence of prescription rules for breaches in the Data Protection Act and the GDPR shows that only breaches in progress on the day of the restricted training session can be sanctioned and that an interpretation otherwise would run up against the case-law adopted by the European Court of Human Rights according to which limitation rules are a condition of a fair trial. The rapporteur recalls that the Commission received four complaints between 2018 and 2019, that checks were carried out by the CNIL delegation in May 2019 and February 2020 and that the rapporteur appointed in December 2019 for the purposes of investigating these elements notified its report on February 28, 2020. The restricted panel therefore considers that the Commission applied a reasonable time between the findings made by the control delegation and the referral to the restricted panel. The restricted committee notes in this regard that it follows from the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union that the obligation of the administration to act within a reasonable time, compliance with which is likely to be monitored by the Union judge, offers a sufficient level of protection in situations where no limitation period is fixed by the texts. (CJEU, n ° T-342/14, Order of the General Court, CR v European Parliament and Council of the European Union, December 12, 2014). The restricted committee therefore considers that the company is not justified in claiming that it only has the power to pronounce the measures referred to in Article 20 III of the Data Protection Act in the presence of persistent and current breaches, and that the procedure followed before it infringed the right to a fair trial. 2. The complaint alleging failure to understand the scope of the referral to the restricted committee The company considers that the restricted committee cannot pronounce on the alleged breach of the provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the Postal and Electronic Communications Code (hereinafter the CPCE). In the first place, the company maintains that the control decision n ° 2019-082C of the president of the CNIL, the acts of investigation or instruction which followed, as well as the decision of the president of December 19, 2019 appointing a rapporteur and referral to the restricted committee, do not apply to article L. 34-5 of the CPCE. Consequently, the restricted committee could not rule on the alleged breach of the provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE without disregarding the scope of its referral. The company also maintains that the restricted panel cannot rely on the elements of the investigation to establish a breach of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE without disregarding the principles of the investigation's specialty - requiring that the investigation or carried out within the limits of its field defined by the decision which constitutes its legal basis - and of fairness of the investigation - obliging the investigators to mention the object and the legal basis of the investigations. The rapporteur recalls that the aforementioned decisions concern the Data Protection Act and the GDPR and that the resulting investigative or investigative acts are carried out within this framework. Article 8 of the law sets the missions of the CNIL and specifies in particular that it ensures that the processing of personal data is implemented in accordance with the provisions of this law and other provisions relating to the protection of personal data. personal data provided for by laws and regulations, European Union law and France's international commitments. The rapporteur therefore maintains that the amended law of 6 January 1978 refers to all the provisions relating to the protection of personal data provided for by legislative and regulatory texts. The prospecting operations referred to in Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE concern the processing of personal data and this article gives competence to the CNIL to ensure compliance with it when the processed data is of a personal nature. Paragraph 6 of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE thus provides that: The National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms monitors, as regards direct prospecting using the contact details of a subscriber or a person physical, compliance with the provisions of this article by using the skills recognized by law n ° 78-17 of 6 January 1978 mentioned above. The restricted party considers that it is within this framework that the CNIL delegation carried out three checks on the company and that the restricted party was contacted. The restricted committee also underlines that this interpretation was adopted by the Council of State which recognized the competence of the CNIL to ensure compliance with the provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE (CE, n ° 368624, March 11, 2015, TUTO4PC Company). Consequently, the restricted committee was regularly seized and it is without disregarding the principles of specialty and loyalty that it relies on the elements of the controls to examine the facts committed by the company with regard to the provisions of article L 34-5 of the CPCE. Secondly, the company maintains that, if the restricted committee could be seized of alleged breaches of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, the investigators of the CNIL cannot carry out investigative measures to this effect, this prerogative being reserved, by virtue of paragraph 7 of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, to the agents of competition, consumption and the repression of fraud and to the civil servants in charge of missions of economic protection of the consumers. However, the rapporteur recalls that the provisions of paragraph 6 of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE provide that the CNIL uses its powers in order to ensure compliance with the aforementioned article with regard to direct prospecting using contact details of a subscriber or a natural person. These powers are specified in the law of 6 January 1978 as amended and they include, under Articles 19 and 20, powers of investigation and sanction. The restricted committee therefore considers that the CNIL agents are competent to carry out control missions under the provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE in order to ensure compliance with this article specifically concerning direct prospecting. using the contact details of a subscriber or a natural person. 3. The vagueness of the complaints against the company The company stresses that the grievances notified in the sanction report are neither materially nor in time and do not meet the standard of proof required in criminal matters. As a result, the company maintains that it is unable to exercise its rights of defense effectively. The rapporteur indicates that the facts on which the breaches were based were noted during the checks carried out by the CNIL delegation on May 3 and 14, 2019 and February 20, 2020. These breaches were materially and temporally characterized in the notified report. to the society. The rapporteur therefore considers that he has enabled the company to exercise its rights of defense. The rapporteur also stresses that the restricted formation is not a criminal jurisdiction and that it has the power to pronounce sanctions of an administrative nature and that therefore the standard of proof required before the restricted formation must not meet the requirements of the criminal matters but to those set by the Data Protection Act and by its implementing decree. In this regard, the rapporteur also recalls that each complaint is supported by elements resulting from the control operations within the framework of which a report, including attached documents, is drawn up. In view of all of these elements, the restricted committee considers that the delegation of control ensured a high standard of proof which guarantees their reliability, that the shortcomings were materially and temporally characterized in the report notified to the company and that thus, the company cannot take advantage of an imprecision of the complaints which are opposed to it. B. On the failure to obtain the consent of the person concerned by a direct prospecting operation by means of an automated electronic communications system in application of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE 1.On the absence of consent from people to receive commercial prospecting messages Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE provides: Direct prospecting by means of an automated electronic communications system within the meaning of 6 ° of Article L. 32, a fax machine or electronic mail using the contact details of '' a natural person, subscriber or user, who has not previously expressed his consent to receive direct prospecting by this means. For the purposes of this article, consent is understood to mean any free, specific and informed manifestation of will by which a person accepts that personal data concerning him / her be used for the purpose of direct prospecting. \[…\]. Under paragraph 6 of the same article, the National Commission for Informatics and Liberties ensures, with regard to direct prospecting using the contact details of a subscriber or a natural person, compliance with the provisions of this article by using the skills which are recognized by the aforementioned law n ° 78-17 of 6 January 1978. To this end, it may in particular receive, by any means, complaints relating to breaches of the provisions of this article \[…\]. The rapporteur maintains that the company does not obtain the consent of persons whose personal data are accessible on the Internet, prior to sending commercial prospecting messages. The rapporteur noted that, during the control of March 14, 2019, the company indicated to the CNIL control delegation that it is building its prospect database from personal data accessible online on the network website. social professional of society \[...\]. She specified that she was working with two companies, A and B, for the creation of personal databases intended for commercial prospecting. First, company A establishes prospecting lists containing the first and last names of prospects, associated with the name of the company in which they work. These data are collected by the Sales Navigator service offered by the company \[...\], which lists all the people working in a company and a region. The NESTOR company then transfers the file established by company A to company B, which enriches this file, in particular by adding the professional e-mail address of the persons. The company indicated to the CNIL control delegation that the files compiled with the help of these two companies allow it, subsequently, to contact people likely to be interested in its services. To do this, it is finally up to another company, company C, to send these prospects information emails and promotional codes on behalf of NESTOR. The company informed the delegation that, since 2017, 635,033 prospects have received such prospecting emails. The company maintains that the legal basis of the processing for the purpose of commercial prospecting of people, carried out on their professional email address, is the legitimate interest of the controller. The company also specified that its ambition is to become the benchmark for business lunch delivery services to its clients' business premises and that it is therefore vital for it to acquire a base of potential business clients. The rapporteur noted that at first, the company had informed the delegation that it was not obtaining the consent of the people since this prospecting emailing - the legal basis of which is the legitimate interest of NESTOR - strictly intervenes in the professional framework constituted by company lunches (professional email address, delivery to professional premises, during the client's professional activity hours, etc.). In its response to the sanction report, the company went on to argue that it ensured individuals' consent for their personal data to be used for ad targeting purposes by choosing the services of the company ... \], whose confidentiality policy provides for the communication of the personal data of its members to advertisers: By choosing the services of the company \[...\], NESTOR has taken the necessary precautions to ensure the consent of prospects to that their data is used for advertising targeting purposes and that it is communicated to advertisers. In this case, NESTOR uses the services of the company \[...\] as one of its subcontractors. The company \[...\] therefore acts in the name and on behalf of NESTOR, which can therefore legitimately rely on the consent obtained by the company \[...\] on its behalf. The restricted training notes that the professional social network \[...\] allows people to register in order to get in touch with professionals, as part of a job search, or to share information with their professional network and to extend this professional network. The limited training therefore considers that the prospecting messages sent by the company for the sale of meals at the workplace of people have little connection with the professional activity of prospects. The restricted party also considers that the prospects canvassed were not aware of the collection of their personal data by the company and that it carried out prospecting by email and SMS, without having previously obtained their consent. In addition, the restricted committee emphasizes that the commercial prospecting carried out by the company falls within the scope of paragraph 1 of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE which provides for a specific legal basis based on consent, thus ruling out the possibility legitimate interest as a legal basis for these prospecting operations. In such circumstances, the restricted party considers that the company is required to obtain the prior, free, specific and informed consent of people to receive direct prospecting messages by e-mail, in accordance with article L. 34-5 of the CPCE. , which it does not do. The restricted training considers that the deletion of personal data collected without the consent of the persons is necessary insofar as this data is processed in the absence of a legal basis, the persons concerned having not given their consent. She notes that the company told her that it had destroyed its database containing the personal data of prospects, without however justifying it. It also considers that it is not necessary to delete the data of prospects who have now become customers of the company. Under these conditions, the restricted committee considers that the company has disregarded the provisions of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE. 2. On the absence of consent from persons creating an account on the website or the application of the company, upon receipt of commercial prospecting messages The rapporteur maintains that the company does not collect the consent of people creating an account on its website or its application for the processing of their personal data for the purposes of commercial prospecting by e-mail. The rapporteur noted that during the creation of an account by the CNIL delegation on the company's website, during the control carried out on May 3, 2019, no process aimed at obtaining consent to the collection and data processing for commercial prospecting purposes by e-mail was not implemented. The rapporteur also noted that the CNIL delegation, which had neither placed any order nor given such consent, received prospecting emails and SMSs from the company. Such mailings continued until August 2019 and are recognized by the company. The restricted party considers that the company is required to obtain the prior, free, specific and informed consent of people creating an account on the company's website or application, to receive direct prospecting messages by e-mail, in accordance with in paragraph 1 of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE. As part of the procedure, the company has justified having inserted a method of obtaining consent from September 11, 2019 on the website and from March 5, 2020 on the application, and its compliance with article L 34-5 of the CPCE since when creating a customer account on the website or on the NESTOR application, the user must complete a registration form, one of the sections of which is to fill in, in particular, his choice to receive daily or weekly menus or special offers by email by checking one of the corresponding boxes. Under these conditions, the restricted committee considers that the breach of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE has been established, but that the company has completely brought itself into compliance on the closing date of the instruction. C. On the breach relating to the obligation to inform individuals pursuant to Articles 12 and 13 of the GDPR Under the terms of paragraph 1 of article 12 of the GDPR: The controller takes appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in articles 13 and 14 as well as to proceed with any communication under articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 as regards the processing of the data subject in a concise, transparent, understandable and easily accessible manner, in clear and simple terms \[…\]. Article 13 of the GDPR requires the controller to provide, at the time the data is collected, information relating to his identity and contact details, the purposes of the processing and its legal basis, the recipients or the categories of recipients. personal data, where applicable transfers of personal data, the retention period of personal data, the rights enjoyed by individuals as well as the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. The rapporteur notes that, as it emerges from the findings made during the online check of February 20, 2020, the information made available to users of the site and the application was not complete within the meaning of Article 13 of the Rules or easily accessible within the meaning of section 12 of the Rules. In defense, the company indicated that it had made corrections, as part of the procedure, in order to deliver information in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR. The restricted committee recalls that in order to consider that a data controller fulfills his obligation of transparency, the information provided must in particular be easily accessible to the persons concerned within the meaning of Article 12 of the Regulation. It notes, in this regard, that this provision must be interpreted in the light of recital 61 of the Regulation, according to which: information on the processing of personal data relating to the data subject should be provided to him at the time when such data are collected from it. In this sense, it shares the position of the G29 presented in the guidelines on transparency within the meaning of the Regulation, adopted in their revised version on 11 April 2018 (hereinafter the guidelines on transparency), which recalls that the person concerned shouldn't have to search for the information but should be able to access it right away. In this case, the restricted committee notes that the personal data collection form allowing registration on the company's website did not include all of the information required by Article 13 of the GDPR or did not refer not to a dedicated page containing all the information provided for by the GDPR. Thus, the restricted committee notes that no information relating to the legal bases of the processing implemented, to the recipients or categories of recipients of the data, to the retention period of the latter or even the existence of the right to introduce a complaint to a supervisory authority was not provided. In addition, the restricted committee considers that the confidentiality policy on the home page of the website was incomplete with regard to the information relating to the retention periods for the personal data of prospects. The restricted party also considers that the confidentiality policy does not allow people to know, for each treatment, what legal basis it is based on, nor the legitimate interest pursued by the data controller when processing of personal data is based on this legal basis. The restricted committee also considers that the confidentiality policy is imprecise with regard to information relating to the recipients of personal data since it is indicated that the data may be transmitted to certain partners \[…\]. The restricted committee considers that if the company is not required to provide the identity of all the recipients of the data, it must, however, at least inform people of the categories of recipients of the data. Finally, the restricted committee observed that no information relating to the protection of personal data was provided to people creating an account on the mobile application. It nevertheless notes that, in the context of the procedure, the company has justified having taken measures to comply with Articles 12 and 13 of the GDPR. First of all, concerning the registration form on the website, the company justifies having inserted in the form, a link entitled Your personal data referring to the confidentiality policy. The company also justifies having brought its confidentiality policy into compliance, which now contains all the information required by article 13 of the GDPR. Finally, the company indicates that it has operated a redesign of its mobile application since March 5, 2020, and that the registration page and the home page of the application have since offered a link to the policy of confidentiality, which also contains all the information required by Article 13 of the GDPR. Under these conditions, the restricted committee considers that the breach of articles 12 and 13 of the GDPR has been established, but that the company had brought itself into compliance by the closing date of the instruction. D. On the breach relating to the obligation to respect the right of access of individuals pursuant to Article 15 of the GDPR Article 15, paragraph 1, of the GDPR provides that the right for a person to obtain from the controller access to personal data concerning him and in particular when the personal data are not collected from the person concerned, any available information as to their source. It is also provided for in paragraph 3 of the same article that the controller provides a copy of the personal data being processed. Finally, article 12.4 of the GDPR provides that the data controller provides the data subject with information on the measures taken following a request made in application of articles 15 to 22, as soon as possible and in any event. within one month of receipt of the request. During the investigation of two complaints received by the CNIL (referrals no. \[…\] And \[…\]), it appeared that the company failed in its obligation to provide the complainants with a copy of the personal data concerning them which 'it held in its database, as well as information relating to the source of these data. Regarding the first complaint (no. \[…\]), The company maintains that after the complaint was referred to the CNIL by the complainant, Mr. X, it communicated to it supporting information specifying that the unsubscription from the lists had been unsuccessful from redirects emails from a second email address to the first. Regarding the second complaint (no. \[…\]), The company maintains that, after the complaint was referred to the CNIL by the complainant, Mr. Y, it communicated to him the source of his personal data. The company adds that the request made by Mr. Y was a request for portability falling under article 20 of the GDPR and not a request relating to the right of access falling under article 15 of the GDPR. In the course of the proceedings, the company argued that it had not understood the scope of these two requests. First, the restricted committee notes that it emerges from the complaint lodged by Mr. X that the latter asked the company, by email of November 8, 2018, for a copy of all of his personal data. is sent as well as information on the source of its data. The restricted committee notes that the company only indicated in return to Mr. X that he was indeed unsubscribed from its mailing lists. The restricted committee thus notes that it emerges from the responses provided by the company to the complainant that it did not provide him with a copy of his personal data, nor their source, as requested. Secondly, the restricted committee notes that it emerges from the complaint lodged by Mr. Y that the company responded to its access request of December 14, 2018 more than five months later, i.e. May 14, 2019. The restricted party considers that the company did not indicate the source of the data, but was content to tell Mr. Y that he had reconstituted his email address on the basis of another email address without indicating to him that this other address. electronic had been obtained via the professional social network \[...\]. So the company only listed the type of data it was processing. The restricted committee also considers that it was clear that this was not a request for portability, in particular in that Mr. Y precisely indicated in his email sent to the company on December 14, 2018 \[…\] I would like to introduce a request for access under the European Data Protection Regulation (RGPD / GDPR) in order to obtain a copy of any information that you keep about me, whether in computerized or manual form, in relation to my information \[…\]. In any event, whether it is a request addressed to the company under article 15 of the GDPR or on the basis of its article 20, the restricted committee considers that the company has not granted it since no his dataset has not been communicated in any format whatsoever. Under these conditions, the restricted committee considers that the breach of article 15 of the GDPR is constituted on these two complaints, although the latter do not demonstrate a structural nature of the breach alleged against the company. The restricted committee also considers that the company had still not brought itself into compliance by the closing date of the instruction. E. On the failure to ensure the security of personal data pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR Article 32 of the Rules provides: 1. Taking into account the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks, the degree of probability and severity of which vary, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a level of security adapted to the risk, including, among others, as needed: a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data; b) the means to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and continued resilience of processing systems and services; c) the means to restore the availability of personal data and access to them within an appropriate timeframe in the event of a physical or technical incident; d) a procedure for testing, analyzing and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of processing. \[…\]. The rapporteur noted that during the online check of May 3, 2019, the delegation observed that a single character password was accepted when creating an account by a person via the mobile application and that a password consisting of six characters was accepted when creating an account via the company's website. During the control of February 20, 2020, the rapporteur noted that if the company had taken measures to strengthen the composition of the password required for the creation of an account on the website of the company, a password composed of a single character was always accepted for the creation of an account on the mobile application. The rapporteur therefore maintains that the password for connecting customers to their personal space, accessible from the mobile application, was still insufficiently robust to ensure the security of personal data, since it was composed of a single character. In defense, the company disputes the deliberate nature of the security defect for which it is accused and indicates that it has modified the measures relating to the management of login passwords to user accounts on its mobile application during the update. of the latter, on March 5, 2020. The restricted group considers that the length and the complexity of a password remain elementary criteria allowing to appreciate the strength of this one. It notes in this regard that the need for a strong password is also underlined by the National Information Systems Security Agency, which indicates that a good password is above all a strong password. is difficult to find even using automated tools. The strength of a password depends on its length and the number of possibilities available for each character in it. This is because a password made up of lower case letters, upper case letters, special characters and numbers is technically more difficult to discover than a password made up of all lower case letters. By way of clarification, the restricted training recalls that to ensure a sufficient level of security and meet the requirements of the robustness of passwords, when authentication is based solely on a username and password, the CNIL recommends, in its deliberation n ° 2017-012 of January 19, 2017, that the password has at least twelve characters - containing at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number and one special character - or has at least eight characters - containing three of these four categories of characters - if it is accompanied by an additional measure such as, for example, the timeout of access to the account after several failures (temporary suspension of access whose duration increases with the number of attempts), the implementation of a mechanism to guard against automated and intensive submission of attempts (eg: captcha) and / or blocking of the account after several authentication attempts we unsuccessful. In the present case, the restricted committee considers, first of all, that with regard to the undemanding rules governing their composition, the strength of the passwords accepted by the company was too weak, leading to a risk of compromise of the associated accounts and of the data they contain. However, the training notes that the company justifies having modified the measures relating to the management of login passwords to user accounts. Consequently, the restricted committee considers that the breach relating to the obligation to ensure the security of personal data is established but that in view of the elements provided by the company during the procedure, there is no instead of issuing an injunction. III. On corrective measures and their publicity Under the terms of III of article 20 of the law of 6 January 1978 as amended: When the data controller or his subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or from this law, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms may also, if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, if necessary in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, seize the restricted committee of the committee with a view to pronouncing, after contradictory procedure, of one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 2 ° An injunction to bring the processing into line with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or from this law or to meet the requests presented by the data subject in order to exercise their rights, which may be accompanied, except in cases where the processing is implemented by the State, a penalty payment the amount of which may not exceed € 100,000 per day of delay from the date set by the restricted group; \[…\] 7 ° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the worldwide annual turnover total for the previous fiscal year, whichever is greater. Under the assumptions mentioned in 5 and 6 of article 83 of regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are raised, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted committee takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the administrative fines imposed under this article for violations of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive. , First, concerning the pronouncement of an administrative fine, the company maintains that the restricted body does not have the power to pronounce a fine for a breach of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE. In addition, the company notes that articles 20 of the law of January 6, 1978 and 83 of the GDPR do not indicate any fine limit applicable for a breach of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE and do not specify the criteria to be taken into account in determining the amount of the fine. As the restricted formation has previously demonstrated, paragraph 6 of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE gives full competence to the CNIL to ensure its respect for the matter which concerns it by using the competences which are recognized to it. by the Data Protection Act. Article 20, paragraph III, point 7) of the amended law of 6 January 1978 specifies that the CNIL has the power to pronounce administrative fines, sets the ceilings and makes a reference to article 83 of the GDPR to know the criteria to be taken into account in determining the amount of these fines. Thus, contrary to what seems to be maintained by the company, it is not Article 83 of the GDPR which is in this case applied to allow the restricted formation to pronounce a fine, but indeed Article 20 of the Law of January 6, 1978, the application of which is expressly provided for by paragraph 6 of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE and which, for its part, makes a reference to the criteria of Article 83 of the GDPR for determining the Amount of the fine. In view of the aforementioned provisions, the restricted committee therefore considers that it has the power to pronounce a fine for a breach of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE. Secondly, the company maintains that the sanction report does not contain any motivation with regard to the legal criteria justifying the imposition of a fine and its amount. The company adds that the proposed fine is disproportionate given the economic context caused by the Covid-19 health crisis. It emphasizes that its financial situation is already severely impacted by this crisis so that the imposition of a fine against it would seriously compromise the sustainability of its activities. In this regard, the company produces an accounting certificate certifying that the estimated available cash for the month of December 2020 would amount to \[…\] euros. On the contrary, the restricted committee considers that the pronouncement of an administrative fine is justified with regard to the criteria laid down by Article 83 paragraph 2 of the GDPR. With regard to the breach of Article L. 34-5 of the GDPR, the restricted committee considers that the company has shown serious negligence in considering that it could, in order to constitute its base of prospects, refrain from collect people's consent. The seriousness of this violation is proven due in particular to the particularly large number of people concerned by the violation and the fact that the CNIL received several complaints, at the origin of the CNIL control procedure. Regarding the breach of the obligation to inform individuals, the restricted training recalls that information and transparency relating to the processing of personal data are essential obligations incumbent on data controllers so that individuals are fully aware of the use that will be made of their personal data, once it has been collected. Therefore, the restricted committee considers that it is necessary to pronounce an administrative fine with regard to the breaches of articles L. 34-5 of the CPCE and 12 and 13 of the RGPD. Regarding the breach of the obligation to respect people's right of access, pursuant to Article 15 of the GDPR, the restricted panel notes that, in the context of the procedure, the company argued that it did not understand the scope of the requests and that the two complaints received do not demonstrate a structural nature of the breach alleged against the company. Regarding the breach of the obligation to ensure data security, in application of article 32 of the GDPR, the restricted committee considers that, in view of the measures taken by the company, it has shown good faith in the framework of the procedure. Consequently, the restricted panel considers, in view of the circumstances of the case, that there is no need to base its fine on the basis of these two breaches, although they are characterized. Regarding the amount of the administrative fine, the restricted panel recalls that paragraph 3 of Article 83 of the Rules provides that in the event of multiple violations, as is the case in the present case, the total amount of the fine cannot exceed the amount fixed for the most serious violation. Insofar as the company is accused of a breach of Articles L. 34-5 of the CPCE and 12 and 13 of the Regulations, the maximum amount of the fine that may be retained is 20 million euros or 4% of worldwide annual sales, whichever is greater. However, the restricted committee also takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine imposed, the financial situation of the company. The company reported its estimated turnover for the year 2020, for the period from January 1 to July 31, at \[…\] euros, a sharp drop compared to 2019 when its turnover had reached \[…\] Euros at December 31. The company also reports an estimate for the period from January 1 to July 31, 2020, of its profit before interest, taxes and depreciation, negative of \[…\] euros. Therefore, in view of the economic context caused by the Covid-19 health crisis, its consequences on the financial situation of the company and the relevant criteria of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the Regulation mentioned above, the restricted committee considers that the imposition of a fine of 20,000 euros appears to be at the same time effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the requirements of article 83, paragraph 1, of these Rules. Third, an injunction to bring the processing into line with the provisions of Articles L. 34-5 of the CPCE, 12, 13, 15 and 32 of the GDPR was proposed by the rapporteur when the report was notified. Regarding the failure to obtain the consent of the person concerned by a direct prospecting operation by means of an automated electronic communications system in application of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, the training Restricted considers that the company having taken the satisfactory measures to obtain the consent of persons when creating an account on the application and on the website, and having undertaken, as part of the procedure, not to send direct prospecting messages by e-mail to prospects without their prior consent, the injunction proposed in the report is no longer necessary. However, the restricted committee considers that the company has not demonstrated that it has deleted from the database of prospects whose prior, free, specific and informed consent to receive direct prospecting messages by e-mail has not been collected by the company. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that an injunction should be issued on this point. Regarding the breach of the obligation to respect people's right of access, in application of article 15 of the GDPR, the company maintains that it has put in place an internal procedure making it possible to grant the requests made with regard to the Article 15 of the GDPR and to have amended it in order to satisfy requests for the right of access in a satisfactory manner. It communicated its internal procedure to the restricted formation, in accordance with the latter's invitation, on November 6, 2020. The restricted committee considers, however, that the company has not fully responded to the requests for access rights presented by Mr. X and Mr. Y. Thus, without ignoring the steps taken by the company to comply with the GDPR and the establishment and amendment of its internal procedure, the restricted committee considers that the company has still not demonstrated its compliance with the Article 15 of the Rules, for lack of having satisfied the requests of Mr. X and Mr. Y. The restricted panel therefore considers that an injunction should be issued. Fourth, the restricted committee considers that the publication of the sanction is justified in view of the plurality of breaches noted, their persistence and their seriousness. Indeed, the restricted committee considers that, if the company has taken measures within the framework of the sanction procedure making it possible to bring the processing of personal data that it carries out into conformity, it has however not taken into account all the requirements set by Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE in terms of obtaining consent, nor those resulting from the Data Protection Act. In addition, the restricted committee considers that the practices of the company, which carried out prospecting operations by e-mail in the absence of contentment of the people, justify the publication of its decision. Finally, the restricted committee considers that publication would strengthen the dissuasive nature of the main sanction. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: - pronounce on the company NESTOR SAS an administrative fine in the amount of 20,000 (twenty thousand) euros for breaches of Articles L. 34-5 of the Postal and Electronic Communications Code (hereinafter the CPCE ) and 12 and 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter the GDPR); - issue an injunction against the company NESTOR SAS to bring the processing into line with the obligations resulting from Articles L. 34-5 of the CPCE and 15 of the RGPD, and in particular: • with regard to the failure to obtain the consent of the person concerned by a direct prospecting operation by means of an automated electronic communications system: \* Justify the deletion of all personal data previously collected without the consent of prospects; • with regard to the breach of the obligation to respect the right of access: \* Fully comply with requests for access rights by communicating a copy of all their personal data held to the requesters, as well as, where applicable, information relating to the source from which their data comes; - match the injunction with a penalty of 500 (five hundred) euros per day of delay at the end of a period of 3 (three) months following the notification of this deliberation, the supporting documents for compliance must be be sent to the restricted group within this period; - make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the company by name after the expiration of a period of two years from its publication. The vice president Philippe-Pierre CABOURDIN This decision may be appealed against to the Council of State within two months of its notification."

The French data protection authority (hereafter the “Commission”), Entered by the Minister of Solidarity and Health a request for an opinion on a draft decree relating to the mobile application known as ""StopCovid""; Having regard to Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data n° 108; Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC; Having regard to the French act n° 78-17 of 6 January 1978, modified, on information technology, data files and civil liberties, in particular its article 6-III; Having regard to the emergency law n° 2020-290 of 23 March 2020 to deal with the COVID epidemic - 19, in particular its article 4; Having regard to law n° 2020-546 of 11 May 2020 extending the state of health emergency and supplementing its provisions; Considering the decree n° 2019-536 of 29 May 2019 modified taken for the application of the law n° 7817 of 6 January 1978 relating to data processing, files and freedoms; Considering the decree n° 2020-551 of 12 May 2020 relating to the information systems mentioned in Article 11 of law n° 2020-546 of 11 May 2020 extending the state of health emergency and supplementing its provisions, in particular its article 9; Having regard to the CNIL’s deliberation n°. 2020-046 from 24 April 2020 delivering an opinion on a proposed mobile application called ""StopCovid""; Considering deliberation n° 2020-051 of 8 May 2020 giving its opinion on a draft decree relating to the information systems mentioned in Article 6 of the law extending the state of health emergency; After hearing Ms Marie-Laure DENIS, Chairwoman, in her report, and Ms Nacima BELKACEM, Government Commissioner, in her observations; Delivers the following opinion: 1. On 15 May 2020, the Commission was urgently requested by the Minister of Solidarity and Health (hereinafter ""the Ministry"") to deliver its opinion on a draft decree relating to the mobile application known as ""StopCovid"", pursuant to the provisions of Article 6.III of the aforementioned Act N° 78-17 of January 6, 1978 (hereinafter the ""French data protection act""). 2. In accordance with these provisions, this opinion shall be published with the corresponding decree. This submission comes in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, and more specifically the so-called ""progressive lockdown exit"" strategy. In this context, the Government is considering implementing an application, called ""StopCovid"", available on smartphones and, maybe in the future, on other mobile devices. It is intended to inform users that they have been in close proximity to persons diagnosed as COVID-19- positive and having the same application, as this proximity entails a risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 3. In its opinion of 24 April 2020, the Commission ruled on the general conformity with the rules on the protection of personal data of a ""contact tracing"" system as envisaged by the Government at the time. The present submission on a draft decree relating to the so-called ""StopCovid"" application, along with a privacy impact assessment (hereinafter ""PIA"") relating to the envisaged system, specifies the proposed conditions of implementation of the contact tracing application. This processing of personal data, which must comply with the applicable provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 15 April 2016 referred to above (hereinafter ""the GDPR"") and the French data protection act, calls for the following comments from the Commission. Regarding the necessity and proportionality of the system 3. The Commission stresses, firstly, that it is fully aware of the seriousness of the crisis linked to the health situation created by the COVID-19 epidemic, which is on an exceptional scale. The implementation of the ""StopCovid"" application is part of the Government's strategy to deal with the epidemic and reflects the desire not to overlook any solutions in the fight against the epidemic, and in particular to better manage the period of deconfinement. 4. The fight against this epidemic, which comes under the constitutionally valid objective of health protection, is a major imperative which may justify, under certain conditions, temporary infringements of the right to protection of privacy and personal data. It has thus justified the authorisation, by the above-mentioned Act of 11 May 2020, of measures based on the processing of personal data, which are particularly sensitive and on a national scale. The ""Contact Covid"" and ""SI-DEP"" information systems, which aim to identify the chains of contamination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and to ensure the monitoring and support of the persons concerned, were authorised in this respect by the aforementioned decree of 12 May 2020, adopted after the Commission's opinion dated May 8, 2020. 5. The Commission would nevertheless point out that the constitutional and conventional protection of the right to respect for private life and the protection of personal data, based in particular on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights, require that infringements of these rights by public authorities must not only be justified on grounds of general interest, as is the case here, but must also be necessary and proportionate to the achievement of that objective. 6. In addition, it recalls the sensitive nature of the implementation of a device, made available by the public authorities, for automatically tracking the contacts of users of a mobile application. While the Commission acknowledges that the planned application respects the concept of data protection by design and by default, such a collection, which is intended to apply to the largest possible part of the population, must, in any event, be considered with caution. It refers on this point to its opinion of 24 April 2020. 7. Secondly, with regard to the usefulness of the “StopCovid” application, the Commission pointed out, in its opinion of 24 April 2020, that the planned system would be admissible only if the government had sufficient information to establish its usefulness for the management of the COVID-19 crisis, particularly when the lockdown is lifted. In particular, it had insisted on the need to integrate this system into a global health policy. 8. In this respect, the Commission notes that the Ministry intends, by implementing the application, to supplement the contact tracing system authorised by the abovementioned Decree of 12 May 2020 and thus contribute more effectively to reducing chains of contamination. The purpose of the processing is thus to allow faster information and alert of contact cases regarding the risks of exposure to the virus, particularly in the case of contact cases that the contaminated or exposed persons do not necessarily know about, such as people encountered in public transport or in shopping facilities. It can also alert certain contact cases of users who may not wish to respond to health interviewers. 9. The Commission further notes that the Ministry has reported several scientific and epidemiological studies, including foreign studies, demonstrating the value to health authorities of having ""contact tracing"" applications available to support manual tracing of the spread of chains of transmission, in order to identify contacts of detected cases as quickly and widely as possible. The Ministry stated that some of these studies lead to the view that such an application is useful for reducing chains of contamination, even when it is downloaded only by a limited part of the population. It also referred to the favourable positions of the COVID-19 scientific council and the National Academy of Medicine. 10. Account should also be taken of the uncertain nature of the information available to the Ministry in this area at the beginning of the deployment of this tool and the difficulty of comparing the planned processing with those already experienced or envisaged in other countries, particularly within the European union. 11. Finally, the usefulness of the application lies in thef act that the planned processing will be linked to the health care system for people exposed to the virus, since the person alerted via the ""StopCovid"" application and who decides, following and in accordance with this notification, to consult a health professional, will then be recorded in the above-mentioned ""Covid Contact"" or ""SI-DEP"" information systems. 12. In the light of these elements, the usefulness of the application and the necessity of the planned processing to accomplish the public interest task entrusted to the public authority, within the meaning of the data protection rules, shall be sufficiently demonstrated prior to the implementation of the processing. 13. Thirdly, with regard to the proportionality of the proposed system, the Ministry provides numerous guarantees to limit the data protection infringements that may be caused by such a system. 14. Several substantial safeguards were included in the Government's initial plan, such as the choice to store pseudonymous identifiers of persons exposed to the disease and not of infected persons on the central server, the use of Bluetooth proximity communication technology to assess the proximity between two smartphones and not the use of geolocation technology, the choice of a voluntary application and the use of pseudonyms that minimise the possibility of identifying the persons concerned. 15. In addition, the Commission notes that several of the additional guarantees it requested in its opinion of 24 April 2020 have been included in the Government's draft. This applies, in particular, to the precise definition of the purposes of the planned processing, the fact that the data controllership is entrusted to the ministry responsible for health policy and the implementation of certain technical security measures. Similarly, while the alerts generated by the application will be linked to the rest of the health system, the Ministry has confirmed that it does not intend to attach any adverse legal consequences to the fact that the application has not been downloaded and that no specific rights will be reserved for those who use the application. Finally, the Commission's recommendation to have an explicit and precise legal basis in national law, on which it would be consulted beforehand, to enable its implementation, was followed by the Ministry, as evidenced by its referral to the Council of State of a draft decree on processing based on Articles 6.1(e) and 9.2(i) of the GDPR. 16. The Commission considers that these elements are such as to reduce the risks posed by data processing to the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects and make the harm proportionate to the estimated usefulness of the system. 17. Fourthly, the Commission points out that the principle of proportionality also implies that the rights to privacy and the protection of personal data should be affected only for the time strictly necessary to achieve the objective pursued. 18. In this respect, the Commission takes note of the temporary nature of the planned application, the term of which is set, by the draft decree, at six months from the end of the state of health emergency. This duration corresponds to that provided for the ""Covid Contact"" and ""SI-DEP"" information systems, the application being useful only in connection with the more general framework for conducting health investigations. 19. The Commission considers this to be a maximum duration. It requests that the actual impact of the system on the overall health strategy be, independently of the evaluation report provided for in the decree following the overall cessation of the “StopCovid” processing, studied and documented on a regular basis throughout the period of its use, in order to ensure its usefulness over time. 20. It is aware that this assessment will be delicate and must be able to take into account, where appropriate, possible periods of renewed outbreaks of the epidemic. However, it considers that this assessment is essential, since an automated contact tracing tool, made available by the public authorities and installed on the smartphones of individuals, is only admissible, as it stressed in its opinion of 24 April 2020 if it makes a useful contribution to health policy. The Commission requests that these monitoring reports be communicated to it as they are drawn up. 21. The draft decree therefore calls for the following comments from the Commission. Regarding the purposes and responsibility for processing Concerning the purposes of the processing 22. Article 1 of the draft decree specifies that the purpose of the processing is : • to inform a user that he/she were in close proximity to at least one other user of the same application who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19, so that there is a risk that they may have been contaminated in turn ; • to educate users of the application, identified as contacts at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2, on the symptoms of the disease, protective measures and how to control the spread of the virus; • referral of at-risk contacts to the competent health actors for their care and access to screening tests; • to improve the efficiency of the model used by the application for the definition of contact cases through the use of anonymous statistical data at the national level. 23. Firstly, with regard to the referral of contacts at risk to the competent health actors, the Commission notes that the draft decree will be amended to specify that contact between the user and the health professional will be recommended on the notification but will remain at the user's discretion. 24. Secondly, the Commission takes note of the Ministry's clarification that the aim of improving the effectiveness of the health model used by the application on the definition of contact cases is to improve the performance of the application and not to measure its health utility. The Commission understands that other methods, such as statistics or surveys, will make it possible to meet the latter objective. 25. Thirdly, the following are expressly excluded from the purposes pursued by the processing: identification of infected persons, identification of areas in which these persons have moved, making contact with the person alerted or monitoring compliance with containment measures or any other health recommendations. Processing should also not be used to monitor the social interactions of persons. 26. Fourthly, in view of the sensitive nature of the data collected and the purposes of the processing, the Commission welcomes the fact that, in accordance with its recommendation in its deliberation of 24 April 2020, the Ministry of Health is designated as the controller. It considers that such a designation makes it possible to help ensure that both the development and deployment and possible developments of the system are defined by or in conjunction with the competent national health authorities. A system based on volunteering 27. The government has followed the recommendations of the European data protection board in its opinion N° 04/2020 of 21 April 2020 and of the Commission in its opinion of 24 April 2020 by basing the ""StopCovid"" application on a mission of public interest, integrated into the global health policy. The Commission had recalled that the choice of this legal basis does not exclude the fact that the downloading and use of the application is voluntary. 28. Article 1 of the draft decree enshrines the principle that the downloading and use of the ""StopCovid"" application must be based on a voluntary approach by the user. 29. The Commission takes note that volunteering materialises in all components of the system: installation of the application, activation of Bluetooth communication, contacting a health professional, notification of a positive diagnosis or a positive result of a COVID-19 test in the application, testing following receipt of a notification, de- installation of the application. Regarding the data collected and processed Concerning the data collected 30. Firstly, the Commission notes that the “StopCovid” application will be based on the ROBERT protocol specified by INRIA. It notes that this protocol was designed with data minimisation and data protection by design in mind right. It also notes that this protocol takes the decision to transmit the identifiers of persons exposed to the virus rather than sending the identifiers of persons actually infected, and that it guarantees that no link will be kept between infected persons and the list of persons they may have exposed to the virus. The Commission notes that this choice protects the privacy of the persons concerned. 31. Article 2 of the draft decree lists the restrictive list of personal data that may be collected in the context of the ""StopCovid"" application. 32. As the Commission has already noted in its deliberation of 24 April 2020, while the system is intended to process personal data within the meaning of the GDPR, the application only collects adequate and relevant data limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed, in compliance with the data minimisation principle laid down in Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR. 33. In addition, personal data concerning health will be processed. The processing of these sensitive data is based on Article 9(2)(i) of the GDPR as mentioned above. 34. However, certain data referred to in the PIA are not mentioned in Article 2 of the draft decree. The Commission takes note of the Ministry's commitment to amend the draft in order to mention the collection of the periods of exposure of users to contaminated persons as well as the country codes. Furthermore, in view of the specificities of the processing, it recommends that the collection of dates of last server query should also be mentioned. Concerning the accuracy of the data 35. The Commission recalls that ensuring the accuracy and updating of the data is a legal obligation under Article 5.1(d) of the GDPR. 36. In this respect, the Commission welcomes the fact that the possibility of intentionally introducing false positives in notifications sent to individuals in order to limit the risk of re-identification in certain types of attacks is no longer envisaged. 37. The Commission notes that the algorithm for determining the distance between users of the application is still under development at this stage and may be subject to future developments. In this respect, the exchange of messages via Bluetooth technology will also be used to estimate the distance between two mobile devices according to the strength of the signal received, while the time stamping of these messages will make it possible to estimate the duration of the interaction. Many parameters need to be taken into account in order to be able to correctly estimate distances via this technology. To this end, calibration tests are currently being carried out in order to propose a suitable statistical model. The Commission thus notes that the determination of a risky interaction will be carried out on a probabilistic basis, which is in line with the general logic of the application to warn users of a risk of contamination, and that under no circumstances will the receipt of an alert from the application mean that the user has actually been contaminated. 38. The Commission notes that a mobile contact tracing application does not take into account the context in which persons were at the time an exposure to an infected person was recorded. For example, a health professional or a reception agent will be particularly likely to be notified by the application as being at risk of having been contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 even though they were protected (wearing a mask, dividing wall, etc.) at the time the contact was recorded. Thus, failure to take into account the context of the contact by the application is likely to result in the generation of numerous false positives. 39. Consequently, the Commission wonders whether the application should eventually provide for the possibility for the user to define time periods during which contacts should not be considered potentially at risk. 40. In any event, in order to take account of these particular cases, the Commission recommends that the information provided to users should include recommendations on the use of the application in specific contexts. The presence of an easily accessible temporary deactivation button on the main screen of the application could reduce the number of false alarms corresponding to moments when the user is not really at risk. 41. The Commission notes that the transfer of the history of pseudonymous identifiers of the contact cases of an infected person from a mobile application to the central server requires the use of a single-use code given by a health professional following a positive clinical diagnosis or a positive COVID-19 test. Therefore, a user will not be able to falsify the central server database of the application by declaring himself/herself positive without having been diagnosed or tested positive. Furthermore, the Commission notes that the verification of the single-use code will be limited to its validity and will not involve verification of the identity of the person to whom it was issued. The Commission also notes that this transmission will take place without the contact history transmitted to the server being able to be linked to the infected person. Regarding the recipients and persons who have access to the data 42. Article 3 of the draft decree specifies that users of the application who will be notified as being at risk of having contracted COVID-19 are recipients of the information that they have been in proximity of another user which has been diagnosed or tested positive for the virus. 43. Furthermore, the Commission notes that the forwarded PIA lists several actors acting as processors on behalf of the controller. 44. Firstly, the Commission recommends that the draft decree be completed to mention that subcontractors will only be accessing or receiving personal data they need to know with regard to their missions. 45. Secondly, the PIA specifies that the processing relations between the controller and its processors, in particular in their capacity as host, are concluded or provided for in the form of an agreement, during the various phases of the application project, namely the development, production and operating phases. The Commission recalls that such an agreement must specify the obligations of each party, in compliance with the provisions of Article 28 of the GDPR, in particular as regards the exercise of the rights of data subjects and security measures. 46. The Commission notes that the cloud computing service provider hosting the application infrastructure, acting as a subcontractor, has data centers located in France. The subcontracting contract between it and the data controller must, in particular, specify the geographical areas from which the administrators access the infrastructure. 47. Lastly, it notes that Article 1 of the draft decree qualifies INRIA as a subcontractor and states that the processing by INRIA, on behalf of the Ministry, is carried out under the conditions laid down in Article 28 of the GDPR. The Commission wonders about such a qualification in the light of the definition of a subcontractor given in Article 4.8 of the GDPR. Regarding data transfers outside the European union 48. Both the draft decree and the PIA mention that personal data are not transferred outside the European union. The Commission therefore notes that the processing will take place exclusively on the territory of the European union. Regarding the storage limitation 49. The Commission notes that Article 4 of the draft decree provides for the keys and identifiers associated with the applications to be kept for the duration of operation of the ""StopCovid"" application and for no more than six months from the end of the state of health emergency. The local histories of persons diagnosed or tested positive are to be kept for fifteen days from their emission. 50. In accordance with the principle of storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR), the period of storage of data must be limited to what is strictly necessary for the purposes previously described. Therefore, temporary identifiers exchanged between applications as well as the associated timestamps may not be kept for a longer period of time than the period during which these data are actually useful to determine whether a contact may have led to a risk of contamination. Thus, this period has been estimated at 15 days, in accordance with the recommendation of the French Public Health Agency and the Ministry. 51. The Commission takes note that the user of the application may, at any time, request the deletion of his data from his smartphone and the central server database by means of a feature made available to him in the application, prior to uninstallation. Indeed, if the user can uninstall the application at any time, this will result in the deletion of his data from his smartphone, but will have no effect on the data stored at the server level. The Commission considers that if it appears to be technically impossible to delete the data on the server after the user has deleted the application, the data should be deleted after a period of inactivity, to ensure that in such a case data that is no longer needed is not retained. In addition, users should be advised to delete their data from the central server before uninstalling the application. Regarding the respect of the rights of individuals with regard to their personal data On transparency requirements 52. With regard to compliance with transparency obligations (Articles 5.1.a) and 12 to 14 of the GDPR), Article 5 of the draft decree specifies, on the one hand, that data subjects are informed of the main characteristics of the processing and their rights when the ""StopCovid"" application is installed and, on the other hand, that information notices are also made available to the public via the ""https://www.stopcovid.gouv.fr"" website. 53. In addition, the PIA states that infographics will complement the information by making the underlying technological concepts more accessible. 54. Firstly, the Commission draws the Ministry's attention to the fact that all the information must be made available to the user within the application itself. Such an obligation does not, however, preclude the possibility of adopting a layered approach whereby the controller chooses to include the main features of the processing operation in a first layer. In any case, information in conformity with the provisions of the GDPR must be easily accessible both when the application is installed and throughout its use. 55. Secondly, the Commission insists on the need to provide information that can be understood by as many people as possible, since a large part of the population is likely to be affected by the measures. The information should also be made available in such a way as to enable people with disabilities to become acquainted with it. 56. Special attention should also be paid to minors, even though the information provided will be the same for all users of the application. Minors equipped with smartphones by their parents are indeed likely to download the application, under conditions of common law. For them, even more than for other users, particular attention must be paid to the information provided, so that the application is used properly and the alert message that may be addressed to them is adapted and properly interpreted. The Commission therefore calls for specific developments to be included in the information provided to users, both for the minors themselves and for their parents. 57. In the light of these elements, the examples of information notices provided in the PIA will require further work in order to comply with the provisions of Articles 12 to 14 of the GDPR. On the rights of access, rectification, portability and the right to restrict processing 58. The Commission notes that Article 5 of the draft decree is intended to exclude the rights of access, rectification and the right to restrict the processing on the basis of Articles 11 and 23(i) of the GDPR. 59. As regards the right to rectification and the right to limit processing, the Commission considers that, in view of the characteristics of the processing, these are not intended to apply. The same applies to the right of portability, since the processing is not based on Article 6(1)(a) or (b) of the GDPR. 60. The right of access could theoretically concern the consultation by a user of the keys and pseudonymous identifiers associated with his/her own application. Given the fact that consultation of these data is of very little use to the data subject, particularly in view of their pseudonymous nature, and that free consultation of these data by any person who could take possession of the smartphone on which the application is installed would be likely to undermine the security of the system, the Commission considers that it follows from provisions 11, 15(4) and 23 of the GDPR that the Ministry may waive the right of access. This is because the application is designed for public health purposes and pseudonymization is an important element in protecting the privacy of the individuals who will use the system. On the right of erasure and the right of opposition 61. The Commission notes that the Ministry considers that the right to erasure and the right of object to object are not applicable in this context. 62. On the one hand, the Ministry considers that the provisions of article 17.3(b) and (c) of the GDPR exclude the application of the right of erasure and, on the other hand, it intends to waive the right of objection on the basis of section 23 of the GDPR. 63. The Commission considers that since the processing is voluntary, the right to erasure and the right to object should be fully applicable. Furthermore, the Commission notes that, in practice, the PIA does provide for the possibility for the user to exercise these rights effectively. 64. Firstly, the user can request the deletion of these data directly via the application, both as regards to the data stored on the terminal and the data available on the central server. 65. Secondly, the right to object is materialised by the possibility for the user to stop using the application at any time by unsubscribing from the server or uninstalling it from the terminal equipment. The PIA specifies, in this respect, that the unsubscription must lead to the deletion of data both locally and on the central server and that the uninstallation will lead to the deletion of data locally; the data potentially present on the central server can then no longer be linked to a user. 66. The Commission takes note of the Ministry's commitment to amend the draft decree on these points. Regarding security measures 67. As a preliminary remark, the Commission notes that the envisaged system has been the subject of additional measures on a number of points raised by the Commission in its deliberation of 24 April 2020. 68. Firstly, as regards to the security of the server responsible for centralising the identifiers of users exposed to the virus, the Commission’s opinion drew attention to the need to implement organisational and technical security measures to provide the highest possible guarantees against any misuse of data, given the centralised nature of the protocol implemented within the ""StopCovid"" application. As such, the Commission notes that the Ministry will resort to security modules to protect the encryption keys allowing access to data subjects’ identifiers. 69. The Commission also notes that the controller plans to set up a committee bringing together several entities to which fragments of the encryption keys would be entrusted, in order to ensure that no single actor can misuse the data. The Commission considers that such a measure is likely to limit the risks of corruption of the central database, and calls on the Ministry to include in this committee organisations of different types and with a high level of independence, and notes that the participation of scientific research institutions would further increase the level of guarantee provided by the system. However, the Commission calls on the Ministry to specifically assess the level of guarantee offered by such a measure in the PIA, and to put in place additional guarantees if necessary. 70. Secondly, regarding the use of cryptographic mechanisms, the Commission recalls that in its opinion it expressed its views on the need to resort to state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms that comply with the General Security Reference Framework published by the National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI). The Commission notes in this respect that the protocol has evolved, with the 3DES encryption algorithm replaced by SKINNY-CIPHER64/192, as recommended by the ANSSI. 71. Thirdly, regarding the publication of the source code, the draft decree mentions that some elements of the ""computer code"" of the application or of the central server will not be made public, as this would compromise the integrity and security of the application. Even if the configuration of the software used and the details of the security measures are not intended to be made public, it is important that the entire source code be made public. The Commission welcomes the Ministry's commitment to make the entire source code public and suggests that the Decree be amended accordingly. 72. Furthermore, the Commission notes that the use of certificate pinning on mobile applications is a good practice, allowing applications to securely authenticate the server with which they are communicating and thereby ensure the strict confidentiality of the data exchanged with the server. 73. The Commission notes that only individually authorised persons will be able to access the data stored on the central server. The Commission recalls that the authentication procedures for these persons must comply with Decision No. 2017-012 of 19 January 2017 adopting a recommendation on passwords, and that, given the nature of the processing, the Commission recommends that strong authentication mechanisms be put in place. 74. The Commission notes that the infrastructure provider hosting the StopCovid platform, acting as a data processor, is qualified as SecNumCloud by ANSSI, is certified as a Health Data Host (HDS) and implements ISO/IEC 27001 certified data centers. 75. In addition, the Commission notes that, in accordance with the General Security Baseline, StopCovid will be subject to security certification before the application is put into production. It also notes that ANSSI is involved in the implementation of the application and that a number of recommendations have been issued by ANSSI to the controller. 76. In addition, the Commission welcomes the fact that security audits are planned by ANSSI throughout the development of the application. The Commission also notes that audits will be carried out by third parties. 77. The Commission notes that the Ministry plans to use a CAPTCHA when initializing the application, in order to verify that it is being used by a natural person. The Commission notes that the planned CAPTCHA is based, as a first step, on the use of a service provided by a third party. The Commission notes that the use of this service is likely to involve the collection of personal data not provided for in the Decree, data transfers outside the European Union, and read/write operations that would require the user's consent. The Commission also notes that the end user should be informed of these processing operations in accordance with the GDPR and that the relationship with this third party should be governed by a subcontracting agreement. Consequently, the Commission calls on the Ministry to be vigilant and would like to see further developments of the application to allow the use of alternative technology in the near future. 78. Finally, the Commission notes some operations are planned to be subject to logging measures. Regarding data relating to technical errors, the Commission recommends that only the minimum amount of data strictly necessary for checking the proper functioning of the system should be logged, and in particular that these logs should be free of user identifiers or cryptographic keys. With regard to the logging of actions carried out by administrators, the Commission recommends that it should be kept for a period of six months under conditions that guarantee its integrity, and that automatic analysis mechanisms should be put in place to detect any abnormal operation. 79. The Commission notes that evolutions in the application and the contact tracing protocol, in particular in order to enable EU-wide interoperability, are likely to be developed in the medium term. The Commission also takes note of the Ministry's intention to request the Commission’s opinion, including on an optional basis, on any changes to the processing operation.

Facts and procedure 1. Following the confinement decided by the Government in March 2020, several press articles reported on the use, by the police (in particular the Cergy-Pontoise police station) and the gendarmerie (in particular the grouping departmental gendarmerie of Haute-Garonne), drones equipped with a camera to ensure compliance with the measures taken in this context. The use of such drones, appearing to her likely to implement the processing of personal data, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms (hereinafter the CNIL or the Commission), by letter of 23 April 2020, asked the Ministry of the Interior for details on the processing carried out in this context. 2. In the absence of response, the Commission's Chair, by Decision o 2020-076C of 7 May 2020 initiated a review proceedings against the Department. The purpose of this procedure was to verify that the Ministry of the Interior all the provisions of complied with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (hereinafter the Regulation or the RGPD) of law No o 78-17 of 6 January 1978 relating to computers, files and liberties (hereinafter the Act of 6 January 1978 or the data Protection Act) of Directive (EU ) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereafter the police-justice directive) and the provisions provided for in articles L251-1 et seq. Of the Internal Security Code. As part of this procedure, the President of the Commission, on May 8, 2020, sent to the Ministry of the Interior, the Paris police headquarters, the Cergy-Pontoise police station and the departmental gendarmerie group of Haute -Garonne questionnaires on the use of drones to enforce the containment measures deployed in the context of the state of health emergency. The Ministry of the Interior replied to all of these questionnaires by letter of May 27, 2020. 3. On July 9, 2020, a delegation from the CNIL visited the premises of the Paris police headquarters in order to carry out an on-site check. This control notably enabled the control delegation to carry out a test flight of a drone used by the Paris police headquarters. 4. Various exchanges took place by email between the ministry and the control delegation between July and September 2020. These exchanges concerned the transmission of documents requested during the control as well as details requested subsequently. 5. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission appointed, on October 2, 2020, Mrs Sophie LAMBREMON as rapporteur, on the basis of article 22 of the law of January 6, 1978. 6. At the end of her investigation, the rapporteur, on October 30, 2020, sent the Ministry of the Interior a report detailing the breaches of the Data Protection Act that she considered to have constituted in this case. The rapporteur proposed to the restricted formation of the Commission to issue an injunction to bring the processing into conformity with the provisions of Article 87 of the Data Protection Act, as well as a call to order. It also proposed that this decision be made public and no longer allow the ministry to be identified by name after a period of two years from its publication. 7. The same day, the Ministry of the Interior was informed that this file was on the agenda of the session of the restricted formation of December 10, 2020. 8. On 1 st December 2020, the ministry has submitted observations. 9. The Ministry and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the session of the restricted formation. II. Reasons for the decision A. On the existence of processing of personal data 10. The rapporteur observes that the Paris police headquarters, the Cergy-Pontoise police station and the Haute-Garonne departmental gendarmerie group have used drones to verify compliance with the containment measures. In addition, the Paris police headquarters also used these devices for other purposes, such as judicial police missions (recognition of a place before an arrest, monitoring of drug trafficking), maintenance operations order (surveillance of demonstrations) or crisis management and road checks (surveillance of urban rodeos). 11. The rapporteur notes that the drones used are equipped with a camera allowing the capture of high resolution images and having zoom capabilities capable of enlarging the image between six and twenty times. 12. In the light of these technical capacities, the rapporteur considers that the use of these drones by the Ministry of the Interior gives rise to the processing of personal data when people are filmed in conditions allowing their identification. 13. The Ministry of the Interior, for its part, first affirmed in response to questionnaires sent by the President of the CNIL that the flight of drones did not give rise to any processing of personal data, people did not being not identifiable. In its observations in response to the sanction report, it then considered that the legal uncertainty relating to the nature of the data processed demonstrated the good faith of the administration, that in any event, the blurring system implemented excluded any processing of personal data, while specifying that technical considerations prevented this blurring system from being performed at the level of the drone capturing the images and before any transmission thereof. 14. The restricted committee considers that the qualification of processing of personal data applies to a video capture system filming people for the following reasons. 15. First , on the existence of processing of personal data, article 2 of the Data Protection Act provides: unless otherwise provided, within the framework of this law the definitions of the Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 . 16. Pursuant to article 4 of the GDPR, personal data processing constitutes any operation or set of operations carried out or not using automated processes and applied to data or sets of data of a personal nature. personal, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, preservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, dissemination or any other form provision, reconciliation or interconnection, limitation, erasure or destruction . This same article defines personal data as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person \[…\]; is deemed to be an identifiable natural person a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference \[…\] to one or more specific elements specific to his physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity . 17. In view of these definitions, the restricted committee notes that any operation - in particular the capture, transmission, modification or consultation - relating to the image of persons who can be recognized constitutes processing of personal data. 18. The restricted committee observes that this analysis, adopted for a long time by the CNIL, has been enshrined in European case law since 2014: the image of a person recorded by a camera constitutes personal data within the meaning of the provision referred to in the previous point insofar as it allows the data subject to be identified (CJEU, 11 December 2014, Ryneš, case C-212/13, point 22). It was very recently recalled by the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter the EDPS) in its guidelines 3/2019 of 29 January 2020 on the processing of personal data by video devices: Systematic surveillance and automation of a specific space by optical or audiovisual means, mainly for the purpose of protecting property or protecting human life and health, has become an important phenomenon of our time. This activity entails the collection and retention of pictorial or audiovisual information about all persons entering the monitored space that are identifiable on the basis of their appearance or other specific elements. The identity of these persons can be established on the basis of this information . 19. With regard more specifically to drones equipped with a camera, the summary judge of the Conseil d'État considered that the disputed surveillance system \[…\] which consists in collecting data, thanks to the capture of images by drone, to transmit them, in certain cases, to the command center of the police headquarters for real-time viewing and to use them for carrying out administrative police missions constitutes processing (Council of State, ordinance of 18 May 2020, nos . 440442 and 440445). Noting that no system was in place to prevent, in all cases, that the information collected could lead to making the persons identifiable, this court concludes that the data likely to be collected by the disputed processing must be regarded as of a personal nature . 20. Finally, in an opinion of September 20, 2020 on the use of airborne image capture devices by public authorities, the Council of State specified that, in particular in view of the technologies currently available and their development and material resources available to the public authorities, the Council of State considers that the images of people captured by airborne cameras by these authorities as part of public security or civil security missions should, in principle, be regarded as data personal and that, therefore, the collection and use of these images are subject to compliance with the texts recalled above. However, it could be different in the event of use under special conditions excluding the existence of reasonable possibilities of identifying people, or in the event that technical devices preventing identification are implemented (Conseil d'État section of the interior, meeting on Tuesday, September 20, 2020, n o 401 214). 21. The restricted committee recalls that in this case, the Paris police headquarters, the Haute-Garonne departmental gendarmerie group and the Cergy-Pontoise police station admitted to having used drones equipped with a camera in the context of for verifying compliance with containment measures and, for the Paris police headquarters, for other purposes, in particular for justice and law enforcement. These drones flew at an altitude of between 30 and 120 meters, according to the actors, and were equipped with a 12 million pixel lens that could enlarge the image between six and twenty times. 22. The control delegation, having carried out a drone test flight on July 9, 2020, noted that the technical characteristics mentioned above allow the identification of people. 23. Secondly , with regard to a possible blurring device which could make it possible to make the persons concerned unidentifiable, the restricted formation notes, first of all, that the Paris police headquarters, the departmental gendarmerie group de Haute-Garonne and the Cergy-Pontoise police station indicated, in their response to the questionnaires sent, that no blurring device had been put in place. 24. It then observes that the Paris police headquarters subsequently indicated, during the check carried out on July 9, 2020, that a blurring device was under development. The Interior Ministry specified, during the session of December 10, 2020, that its deployment had been effective since the end of August 2020. 25. Consequently, the restricted training noted, on the one hand, that such a device was not implemented during the flights mentioned in the questionnaires sent to the operational services, and that drones equipped with a camera were therefore carried out numerous flights without blurring the images collected before the deployment of the mechanism. It considers, on the other hand, that the device described during the present procedure cannot, however, exempt the images collected from the applicable regulations on the protection of personal data. 26. Indeed, firstly, the evoked blurring system does not apply to the images captured by the camera present on the drone and transmitted to the pilot of the drone. If the visualization of unblurred images by the drone pilot is easily explained by security imperatives (control of the aircraft during flight time), which the restricted training does not question, the fact remains that the capturing of non-blurred images by the camera and their transmission to the pilot constitute personal data processing operations. 27. Secondly, it follows from the responses provided by the police headquarters that it recorded unblurred images when using drones for the needs of judicial police missions, which also constitutes processing. of personal data. 28. Finally, and contrary to the statements made by the Ministry of the Interior during the session, it emerges from the documents communicated in defense, and more particularly from the note relating to blurring entitled Processing of video streams from drones, dated 23 November 2020, that the blurred flows can be consulted in clear by the agents of the police headquarters: The blurring device being controlled by the DILT (direction of innovation, logistics and technologies) , it is impossible for the DOPC (public order and traffic department) to access unblurred flows. Access to unblurred streams would require a modification of the configuration currently implemented; only an engineer with rights to the entire device can do this laborious work. Engineers with these rights are placed under a different command from that of the DOPC. The limited training deduces from this document that, although laborious, access to unblurred streams remains possible by persons placed under the responsibility of the data controller. Therefore, the processing must be qualified as processing of personal data. B. On the identification of the data controller 29. The restricted committee emphasizes that all the processing operations covered by this procedure, the purpose of which is to ensure compliance with the containment measures adopted in the context of the state of health emergency, to intervene for the benefit of police missions, policing missions, or as part of crisis management or traffic control, within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the interior, in accordance with Decree o 2017-1070 of May 24, 2017 relating to the powers of the Minister of the Interior, which disposes of the Minister of the Interior prepares and implements the Government's policy in matters of internal security, public freedoms, territorial administration of the State, d immigration, asylum and road safety . 30. It also underlines that the services concerned (grouping of departmental gendarmerie of Haute-Garonne, police station of Cergy-Pontoise and prefecture of police of Paris) all act under the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior. 31. The Ministry of the Interior considers itself to be the controller, its central services having, moreover, drawn up a command instruction providing for the use of drones, in particular within the framework of containment. 32. Consequently, the restricted committee holds that the latter must be considered the data controller concerned by this procedure. C. On the applicable law 33. The first paragraph of Article 87 of the Data Protection Act, Article I of Title III of the Act provides: this Title shall apply without prejudice to Title I er , data processing of personal data set implementing, for the purposes of preventing and detecting criminal offenses, investigating and prosecuting them or enforcing criminal sanctions, including protection against threats to public security and the prevention of such threats, by any competent public authority or any other body or entity to which has been entrusted, for these same purposes, the exercise of public authority and public power prerogatives, hereinafter referred to as the competent authority . 34. Title III therefore applies to processing operations which meet a dual characteristic relating to their purpose, on the one hand, and to the quality of the controller, on the other. 35. As regards the purposes pursued by the processing resulting from the flights of drones equipped with a camera, it appears from the declarations made by the departmental gendarmerie group of Haute-Garonne, by the Cergy-Pontoise police station and by the prefecture of police in Paris that the images were used by these three actors to ensure compliance with the containment measures adopted in the context of the state of health emergency and, for the last of them only, to other purposes, such as judicial police, law enforcement, crisis management and road control missions. 36. The restricted committee considers that the aforementioned missions fall within the scope of the purposes referred to in Article 87 of the Data Protection Act, either because they aim to prevent or detect criminal offenses - for example, when drones are used to ensure compliance with containment or road control measures -, to investigate or prosecute in criminal matters - for example for judicial police missions - to protect against threats to public security and prevent such threats - for example for law enforcement or crisis management missions. 37. The limited training also considers that in the framework of these missions, the Ministry of Interior must be regarded as the competent authority under Article 1 st of Decree o 2020-874 of July 15, 2020 on the powers of the Minister of the interior (previously Decree o 2017 to 1070 of 24 May 2017), supra. 38. Consequently, the restricted committee considers that in this case, the processing implemented by the Ministry of the Interior for the various purposes mentioned above must comply with the provisions of Title III of the Data Protection Act. D. On breaches 1. The breach relating to the lawfulness of the processing and the lack of an impact study 39. The second paragraph of article 87 of the Data Protection Act provides that the processing referred to in Title II of the law is only lawful if and to the extent that it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out. , for one of the purposes set out in the first paragraph, by a competent authority within the meaning of the same first paragraph and where the provisions of Articles 89 and 90 are complied with . 40. Under I of article 89 of the law, if the processing is carried out on behalf of the State for at least one of the purposes set out in the first paragraph of article 87, provision is made for by a legislative or regulatory provision made under the conditions provided for in I of Article 31 and in Articles 33 to 36 . Pursuant to II of the same article, if the processing relates to data referred to in article 6 of the law (known as sensitive data), it must be provided for by a legislative or regulatory provision taken under the conditions provided for in II of the article 31. Article 31 of the law to which reference is made requires that the data processing in question be authorized by order of the competent minister or ministers, taken after a reasoned and published opinion of the Commission and, in the event of processing of sensitive data, by a decree of the Council of State taken after a reasoned and published opinion from the CNIL. 41. Article 90 of the law provides: if the processing is likely to generate a high risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular because it relates to data mentioned in I of article 6, the data controller carries out an impact assessment relating to the protection of personal data . 42. As a preliminary point, the restricted committee notes that the Ministry of the Interior does not dispute the characterization of this failure, having wrongly considered that the processing operations in question did not relate to personal data. 43. With regard to the provisions of article 89, the restricted committee notes that no legislative or regulatory framework authorizes and regulates the processing of personal data arising from the use by the Ministry of the Interior of drones equipped of a camera. By indicating that work is underway to develop a legal framework as soon as possible, the Ministry of the Interior confirms this point. 44. With regard to the provisions of Article 90, the Restricted Committee considers that the processing carried out in this case is likely to create a high risk for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned. This high risk arises, on the one hand, from the characteristics of drones, which are flying objects carrying a camera capable of filming in high resolutions, anywhere and at any time. They are therefore capable of filming any person circulating in the public space, of following them and of processing intangible personal data such as their facial features. The risk arises, on the other hand, from the use made of drones by the Ministry of the Interior, in particular during demonstrations, occasions during which the political opinions, religious or philosophical convictions of people, or their trade union membership, are likely to be revealed. Finally, the risk is aggravated by the fact that the treatments are potentially implemented without the knowledge of the people, they are often not aware of the presence of drones, the activation of the camera and the capture. of their image. This risk is in this respect aggravated, in the present case, by the lack of information of the persons during the thefts carried out. 45. The restricted committee noted that article 90 of the Data Protection Act specifies that this risk may also arise due to the use of new mechanisms , which is indeed the case in this case. 46. ​​Consequently, the restricted committee considers that the use of drones equipped with a camera gives rise to a high risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons and that, therefore, it was up to the Ministry of the Interior to carry out an impact assessment relating to the protection of personal data. 47. The restricted committee noted that no impact analysis was carried out. 48. All of these elements show that the conditions for lawfulness of the processing operations are not met. The restricted committee therefore considers that breaches of articles 89 and 90 of the Data Protection Act have occurred. 2. On the failure to inform individuals Under the terms of article 104 of the Data Protection Act, the data controller makes the following information available to the person concerned: 1 ° The identity and contact details of the data controller and, where applicable, those of his representative; 2 ° Where applicable, the contact details of the data protection officer; 3 ° The purposes pursued by the processing for which the data are intended; 4 ° The right to lodge a complaint with the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms and the contact details of the commission; 5 ° The existence of the right to request from the data controller access to personal data, their rectification or erasure, and the existence of the right to request a limitation of the processing of personal data relating to a data subject . 49. As a preliminary point, the restricted committee notes that the Ministry of the Interior does not dispute the characterization of this failure, recalling only the commitments made to ensure, in the future, the information of the persons concerned. 50. The restricted party noted that the departmental gendarmerie group of Haute-Garonne and the Cergy-Pontoise police station indicated, in their response to the questionnaire sent, that people were informed of the presence of the drone by a voice message inviting them to disperse. The Paris police headquarters indicated that no specific information system had been put in place. 51. It emerges from the answers provided that no information meeting the requirements of Article 104 of the Data Protection Act was communicated to the persons concerned. 52. The restricted committee notes that, although article 107 of the Data Protection Act allows, under certain conditions, restrictions on the rights of individuals and in particular on the right to information, these restrictions must be provided for by the act establishing treatment . In the present case, in the absence of any act establishing the processing in question, no limitation to the right to information could be provided for. 53. All of these elements show that the information provided to individuals, when it existed, did not meet legal requirements. The restricted committee therefore considers that a breach of article 104 of the Data Protection Act has been established. III. On corrective measures and their publicity 54. Under the terms of III of article 20 of the law of 6 January 1978: When the data controller or his subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or from this law, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms may also, if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, if necessary in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, seize the restricted committee of the committee with a view to pronouncing, after contradictory procedure, of one or more of the following measures: 1 ° A call to order; 2 ° An injunction to bring the processing into line with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or from this law or to meet the requests presented by the data subject in order to exercise their rights, which may be accompanied, except in cases where the processing is implemented by the State, a penalty payment the amount of which may not exceed € 100,000 per day of delay from the date set by the restricted group; (…). 55. The rapporteur suggests to the restricted committee that a call to order be issued as well as an injunction to bring the processing into conformity with the provisions of the Data Protection Act. She also proposes that this decision be made public. 56. In defense, the Ministry of the Interior considers that the pronouncement of a corrective measure is not justified, a formal notice seeming sufficient in this case, and that the publicity of the possible measure to be taken is not does not appear necessary. Finally, he considers that the injunction to cease the use of drones is not possible, this use now constituting an undeniable operational necessity. 57. The restricted committee considers that, in the present case, the aforementioned failures justify a call to order against the Ministry of the Interior for the following reasons. 58. The restricted committee notes the seriousness of the breach relating to the lawfulness of the processing operations, this failure depriving all the processing operations carried out of a legal basis. It also emphasizes that the data subjects were deprived of all the guarantees from which they should have benefited, in particular information relating to processing and the exercise of their rights. 59. It also notes the significant risks for the rights and freedoms of individuals, previously mentioned, linked to the possibility offered by these new devices to identify any person circulating in the public space, including in circumstances that may reveal particularly sensitive, for example linked to their political opinions, their religious or philosophical convictions or their trade union membership. 60. It also notes that technological developments are making drones more and more discreet with increased capturing capacities of their cameras which give the Ministry of the Interior the possibility of flying its drones at increasingly high altitudes, while maintaining an image with great precision. People are therefore unlikely to become aware of the treatments carried out and the capture of their image. 61. Finally, the restricted training considers that the improvement of technologies such as facial recognition could entail, in the future, even greater risks for individual rights and freedoms if they were coupled with the use of drones. It therefore considers that their deployment outside any legal framework should be severely sanctioned. 62. The restricted panel considers that the aforementioned elements also make it necessary for an injunction to be issued. In addition, the ministry having indicated during the meeting that it did not intend to renounce, including temporarily, the use of drones equipped with a camera, the pronouncement of an injunction constitutes the appropriate measure to bring it to use drones for this purpose only when a legal framework authorizing it has been adopted. 63. Finally, and for the same reasons, the restricted panel considers it necessary for its decision to be made public. It notes, on this point, that the public has demonstrated, over the past few months, a legitimate interest in matters relating to the processing of their personal data by the State. The publication of a sanction decision by the authority specially responsible for the protection of personal data thus appears fully justified. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: · Issue a call to order against the Ministry of the Interior for breaches of Articles 89, 90 and 104 of the Data Protection Act; Issue an injunction against the Ministry of the Interior to bring the treatments referred to in line with the obligations resulting from Article 87 of the Data Protection Act, and in particular: o for the purposes covered by Title III of the Data Protection Act, only use the collection of personal data from drones after the adoption of a normative framework authorizing the implementation of such data processing ; · Make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the ministry by name after the expiration of a period of two years from its publication. President Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be appealed against to the Council of State within two months of its notification."

Faits et procédure 1. La Société de groupe d’assurance mutuelle AG2R LA MONDIALE (ci-après ""la SGAM AG2R LA MONDIALE"" ou ""la société"" ) est une société d’assurance mutuelle créée le 16 janvier 2008. Son siège social est situé \[…\] à Paris \[75008\]. 2. La SGAM AG2R LA MONDIALE appartient au groupe AG2R LA MONDIALE (ci-après ""le groupe"" ), organisme français de protection sociale et patrimoniale remplissant, d’une part, une mission de gestion administrative des retraites complémentaires des salariés du secteur privé et, d’autre part, une activité assurantielle. Le groupe assure environ 15 millions personnes en France, à titre individuel ou à titre collectif, et accompagne plus de cinq-cent-mille entreprises. Le groupe emploie environ dix-mille collaborateurs. 3. Au sein du groupe, la SGAM AG2R LA MONDIALE est chargée de coordonner l’activité assurantielle de prévoyance, dépendance, santé, épargne et retraite supplémentaire. Elle compte plusieurs filiales, parmi lesquelles figurent notamment les sociétés \[…\] et \[…\]. 4. En 2019, le chiffre d’affaires généré par l’activité assurantielle menée par la SGAM AG2R LA MONDIALE s’élevait à 9,6 milliards d’euros pour un résultat net de 350 millions d’euros. En 2020, son chiffre d’affaires s’élevait à 9,3 milliards d’euros pour un résultat net de 222 millions d’euros. 5. Le 29 octobre 2019, en application de la décision n° 2019-164C du 26 septembre 2019 de la présidente de la Commission, une délégation de la CNIL a mené une opération de contrôle sur place au sein des locaux du groupe AG2R LA MONDIALE. Cette mission avait pour objet de vérifier le respect par le groupe AG2R LA MONDIALE de l’ensemble des dispositions du règlement (UE) 2016/679 du Parlement européen et du Conseil du 27 avril 2016 (ci-après ""le Règlement"" ou ""le RGPD"" ) et de la loi n° 78-17 du 6 janvier 1978 modifiée relative à l’informatique, aux fichiers et aux libertés (ci-après ""la loi du 6 janvier 1978 modifiée"" ou ""la loi Informatique et Libertés"" ). 6. Le contrôle visait plus particulièrement les traitements de données à caractère personnel des clients et des prospects du groupe. Les vérifications opérées ont notamment porté sur les durées de conservation des données à caractère personnel et sur l’information portée à la connaissance des personnes concernées s’agissant des traitements effectués par la SGAM AG2R LA MONDIALE. 7. A l’issue du contrôle, le procès-verbal n° 2019-164/1 a été notifié à la SGAM AG2R LA MONDIALE, par courrier daté du 30 octobre 2019. Le 12 novembre 2019, la société a transmis à la CNIL les pièces complémentaires demandées lors du contrôle. A la suite de demandes complémentaires formulées par les services de la Commission, la société a fourni de nouveaux éléments et pièces les 9 décembre 2019, 17 janvier et 10 février 2020. 8. Aux fins d’instruction de ces éléments, la présidente de la Commission a, le 12 novembre 2020, désigné Madame Sophie LAMBREMON en qualité de rapporteure, sur le fondement de l’article 22 de la loi du 6 janvier 1978 modifiée. 9. À l’issue de son instruction, la rapporteure a, le 26 avril 2021, fait notifier à la SGAM AG2R LA MONDIALE un rapport détaillant les manquements au RGPD qu’elle estimait constitués en l’espèce et indiquant à la société qu’elle disposait d’un délai d’un mois pour communiquer ses observations écrites en application des dispositions de l’article 40 du décret n° 2019-536 du 29 mai 2019. Le courrier de notification du rapport précisait à la société que le dossier était inscrit à la séance de la formation restreinte du 17 juin 2021. 10. Ce rapport proposait à la formation restreinte de la Commission de prononcer une injonction de mettre en conformité les traitements avec les dispositions des articles 5-1-e), 13 et 14 du RGPD, assortie d’une astreinte par jour de retard à l’issue d’un délai de trois mois suivant la notification de la délibération de la formation restreinte, ainsi qu’une amende administrative. Il proposait également que cette décision soit rendue publique, mais qu’il ne soit plus possible d’identifier nommément la société à l’expiration d’un délai de deux ans à compter de sa publication. 11. Le 3 mai 2021, par l’intermédiaire de son conseil, la société a demandé à consulter le dossier de la procédure dans les locaux de la CNIL. Le 6 mai 2021, une consultation s’est tenue dans les locaux de la CNIL, au cours de laquelle le conseil de la société a pris copie des pièces souhaitées. 12. Le 26 mai 2021, par l’intermédiaire de son conseil, la société a produit des observations en réponse au rapport de sanction. 13. Le 11 mai 2021, la société a formulé une demande pour que la séance devant la formation restreinte se tienne à huis clos. Par courrier du 20 mai 2021, le président de la formation restreinte a rejeté cette demande. 14. La société et la rapporteure ont présenté des observations orales lors de la séance de la formation restreinte du 17 juin 2021. II. Motifs de la décision A. Sur le manquement à l’obligation de conserver les données à caractère personnel pour une durée n’excédant pas celle nécessaire au regard des finalités pour lesquelles elles sont traitées en application de l’article 5-1-e) du RGPD 15. Aux termes de l’article 5-1 e) du Règlement, les données à caractère personnel doivent être ""conservées sous une forme permettant l'identification des personnes concernées pendant une durée n'excédant pas celle nécessaire au regard des finalités pour lesquelles elles sont traitées ; les données à caractère personnel peuvent être conservées pour des durées plus longues dans la mesure où elles seront traitées exclusivement à des fins archivistiques dans l'intérêt public, à des fins de recherche scientifique ou historique ou à des fins statistiques conformément à l'article 89, paragraphe 1, pour autant que soient mises en œuvre les mesures techniques et organisationnelles appropriées requises par le présent règlement afin de garantir les droits et libertés de la personne concernée (limitation de la conservation)"". 1. Sur la conservation des données à caractère personnel des prospects 16. La rapporteure a tout d’abord relevé que, lors du contrôle le 29 octobre 2019, la société avait indiqué à la délégation que les sociétés du groupe AG2R LA MONDIALE disposaient d’un référentiel fixant les durées de conservation des données à caractère personnel des prospects (issus de fichiers tiers loués) et des clients (personnes titulaires d’un contrat individuel assurantiel auprès de la société ou de ses filiales). Néanmoins, la société a déclaré lors de ce même contrôle que les durées de conservation définies dans ce référentiel n’étaient effectivement pas mises en œuvre au sein de ses systèmes d’information, à l’exception des traitements relatifs à la lutte contre le blanchiment, aux actions locales et aux données de santé. Elle a précisé qu’un plan de mise en œuvre de la politique de confidentialité était prévu et aurait dû débuter au cours du premier semestre 2020. 17. La rapporteure a ensuite relevé que le référentiel relatif aux durées de conservation et le registre des traitements du groupe prévoyaient, pour la prospection visant le réseau de vente à distance, la conservation des données à caractère personnel des prospects pour une durée maximale de trois ans après l’enregistrement en base de données ou le dernier contact à l’initiative du prospect. Or, par courrier en date du 12 novembre 2019, la société a fourni à la délégation de contrôle une extraction provenant de l’application dédiée à la prospection commerciale pour la vente à distance, montrant la présence des données de prospects n’ayant pas eu de contact avec la société depuis plus de trois ans, parfois depuis plus de cinq ans. 18. Dans ses observations du 27 mai 2021, la société a tout d’abord souligné qu’un référentiel relatif aux durées de conservation des données à caractère personnel des clients et prospects ayant bien été défini, aucun manquement ne pouvait lui être reproché au titre de la définition des durées de conservation. 19. Ensuite, la société a expliqué avoir entrepris des actions afin de respecter la durée de conservation maximale des données à caractère personnel des prospects telle que définie à la fois dans son référentiel et dans le registre des traitements du groupe. 20. La formation restreinte relève que, s’agissant de la définition des durées de conservation applicables aux données des prospects de la société, il y a tout d’abord lieu de relever qu’au jour du contrôle, un référentiel relatif aux durées de conservation des données des clients et prospects avait bien été établi pour les sociétés du groupe AG2R LA MONDIALE, mais que les durées de conservation y étant définies n’étaient, selon les déclarations faites par la société lors du contrôle, ""pas effectivement implémentées dans le système d’information de la société, hormis s’agissant des traitements relatifs à la lutte contre le blanchiment, aux actions locales ainsi qu’aux données de santé"" . 21. La formation restreinte relève ensuite que, lors du contrôle du 29 octobre 2019, la délégation a constaté la présence, en base active, des données à caractère personnel de 1917 prospects n’ayant pas eu de contact avec la société depuis plus de trois ans, dont 1405 prospects n’ayant pas eu de contact avec la société depuis plus de cinq ans, sans que la société soit en mesure de justifier de la nécessité d’appliquer des durées de conservation supérieures à la durée maximale de trois ans qu’elle avait elle-même fixée. La formation restreinte relève que la durée de trois ans constitue une durée de conservation proportionnée et conforme aux recommandations faites par la CNIL dans le cadre de la norme simplifiée n° NS-056 (délibération n° 2013-213 du 11 juillet 2013) concernant les traitements automatisés de données relatifs à la gestion commerciale de clients et de prospects mis en œuvre par les organismes d’assurance, capitalisation, réassurance, assistance et par les intermédiaires d’assurance. Si depuis l’entrée en application du RGPD le 25 mai 2018, les normes simplifiées n’ont plus de valeur juridique, elles constituent toujours un point de repère pour les responsables de traitement, leur permettant de s’assurer de leur conformité. 22. La formation restreinte note par ailleurs que la société atteste, depuis le contrôle, avoir formulé et exécuté des requêtes en suppression des données des prospects et mettre en œuvre des purges mensuelles des données des prospects dans la base de données sous-jacente à l’application dédiée à la prospection commerciale pour la vente à distance. 23. Dès lors, si la formation restreinte prend note de ce que la SGAM AG2R LA MONDIALE met désormais en œuvre les durées de conservation définies dans le référentiel précité et le registre des traitements du groupe, permettant ainsi que les données à caractère personnel des prospects ne sont pas conservées pour des durées excédant celles nécessaires au regard des finalités pour lesquelles elles sont traitées, elle relève qu’au jour du contrôle, les durées de conservation que la société avait définies, et qui correspondent aux durées nécessaires à l’atteinte des finalités poursuivies, n’étaient pas respectées. La société a ainsi conservé les données à caractère personnel de ses prospects pendant des durées excessives, en l’absence de justification particulière, et alors que ceux-ci n’avaient montré aucun intérêt pour les produits et services proposés par la société durant plus de trois, voire de cinq ans. 2. Sur la conservation des données à caractère personnel des clients 24. Ainsi qu’il a été indiqué ci-dessus (point 16), la société disposait au jour du contrôle d’un référentiel relatif aux durées de conservation des données de ses clients et prospects, lequel n’était toutefois pas mis en œuvre au sein de ses systèmes d’information, excepté s’agissant des traitements relatifs à la lutte contre le blanchiment, aux actions locales et aux données de santé. 25. Dans le cadre de son rapport, la rapporteure a souligné qu’il devait être tenu compte de la spécificité de la matière assurantielle lors de l’appréciation du caractère proportionné de la durée de conservation des données des clients par une société d’assurance. En particulier, les durées de conservation des données des clients en matière assurantielle doivent permettre de respecter les délais légaux prévus, notamment, par le code des assurances et le code de commerce. Cependant, en l’espèce, la rapporteure a constaté que par courrier du 12 novembre 2019, la société avait fourni des documents montrant la conservation en base active des données à caractère personnel d’un grand nombre de clients, après le terme du contrat d’assurance, pour des durées supérieures à celles fixées par les dispositions légales applicables. Les données conservées étaient relatives, notamment, à l’identité, aux coordonnées personnelles, professionnelles et bancaires, à la vie personnelle et professionnelle, à l’assurance, ainsi que, dans le cadre de certains contrats, à la santé des personnes. 26. En défense, la société a indiqué avoir engagé des actions correctives depuis le contrôle et a produit des justifications en vue d’attester de ses démarches de mise en conformité. 27. La formation restreinte relève tout d’abord qu’il ressort des éléments communiqués par la société postérieurement au contrôle du 29 octobre 2019, que les données de milliers de clients titulaires de contrats de type incendies, accidents et risques divers, lesquelles peuvent être conservées entre deux ans après la fin du contrat (article L. 114-1 du code des assurances, fixant les délais de prescription des actions dérivant d’un contrat d’assurance, aucune autre finalité n’ayant été mise en avant par la société pour justifier d’une conservation à l’issue de l’expiration des contrats) et dix ans pour certaines pièces comptables (article L. 123-22 du code de commerce), l’ont été pour des durées excédant dix ans et parfois supérieures à trente ans. 28. Ensuite, la formation restreinte constate que les données à caractère personnel de près de cent-mille clients titulaires de contrats épargne, épargne patrimoniale, retraite supplémentaire, obsèques et prévoyance, lesquelles peuvent être conservées pour des durées variables pouvant aller jusqu’à trente ans après le dénouement du contrat pour la finalité de gestion des contentieux (article L. 114-1, dernier alinéa, du code des assurances), l’ont été pour une durée supérieure. En outre, aucune autre finalité n’avait été mise en avant pour les traitements postérieurs au contrat. 29. En outre, la formation restreinte relève que les données à caractère personnel de plus de deux millions de clients, collectées dans le cadre des contrats santé, ont été conservées pour des durées excédant la durée légale de cinq ans suivant la résiliation du contrat (délai calqué sur celui de l’article 2224 du code civil, repris dans le référentiel de la société). Elle relève également que la durée de conservation des données de 1,3 million de clients titulaires d’un contrat santé excède dix ans tandis que celle de milliers de clients excède trente ans. 30. Enfin, la formation restreinte relève qu’hormis pour les données concernant les prestations de santé, il n’existait pas, au jour du contrôle, de mécanisme d’archivage permettant la conservation des données des clients à des fins comptables, fiscales ou contentieuses dans la limite des délais de prescription que ce soit en les transférant au sein d’une base d’archives dédiée ou en mettant en place des restrictions d’accès à ces données pour qu’elles ne puissent être consultées que par des personnes spécialement habilitées, ayant un intérêt à en connaître en raison de leurs fonctions (par exemple, le service en charge du contentieux). 31. La formation restreinte observe par ailleurs qu’en défense, la société n’a pas apporté d’éléments de nature à justifier de telles durées de conservation des données. A l’inverse, elle a indiqué avoir engagé un large plan de mise en conformité. A cet égard, la société a notamment expliqué qu’un projet informatique avait été initié dès 2017 afin de parvenir à une mise en œuvre effective et intégrale des durées de conservation des données relatives à ses clients. La société a précisé que le déploiement du projet informatique aurait dû s’achever en mai 2018, mais que le calendrier n’avait pu être tenu en raison de la complexité des systèmes d’information du groupe AG2R LA MONDIALE et de l’interdépendance des applications. La société a ainsi indiqué avoir défini une nouvelle stratégie de suppression des données des clients sur trois années, fondée sur une approche par les risques et le cycle de vie des données, selon le calendrier suivant : 2020 : périmètre traitements sensibles (action sociale, lutte contre le blanchiment) ; 2021 : périmètre santé-prévoyance ; Juin 2021 : échéance du processus d’anonymisation des données liées aux produits d’épargne ; 2022 : périmètre épargne et retraite supplémentaire (cycles de vie des données plus longs - actions se prescrivant par trente ans). 32. La formation restreinte relève que la société a fourni au soutien de ses engagements des justificatifs de suppression des données de clients déjà effectuées, en 2020 et 2021, conformément au projet informatique défini, sur plusieurs applications rattachées au périmètre Santé-Prévoyance . En outre, la société a fourni un document daté du mois de mai 2021 montrant que le processus d’anonymisation des données des clients liées aux produits d’épargne était en cours. 33. Dès lors, si la formation restreinte prend note que la SGAM AG2R LA MONDIALE a fourni des éléments attestant des démarches entreprises pour garantir que les données à caractère personnel de ses clients ne sont plus conservées pour des durées excédant celles nécessaires au regard des finalités pour lesquelles elles sont traitées, elle estime qu’au jour du contrôle, ces données étaient conservées pour des durées excessives. La formation restreinte constate par ailleurs que le manquement subsiste en partie à ce jour, dans la mesure où la mise en œuvre des durées de conservation des données des clients n’est pas entièrement déployée dans les systèmes d’information de la société. En particulier, il ressort des pièces fournies par la société que la quasi-totalité du périmètre ""Santé Prévoyance"" serait en conformité d’ici la fin de l’année 2021 et que les travaux relatifs au périmètre ""Epargne retraite"" se poursuivraient en 2022. La société a précisé dans ses observations en défense et confirmé lors de la séance de la formation restreinte que les travaux de mise en conformité relatifs à la mise en œuvre des durées de conservation des clients dans ses systèmes d’information s’achèveraient à la fin de l’année 2022. 34. Au regard de l’ensemble de ces éléments, la formation restreinte considère que le manquement à l’article 5-1-e) du RGPD est caractérisé. B. Sur le manquement relatif à l’obligation d’informer les personnes en application des articles 13 et 14 du RGPD 35. Les articles 13 et 14 du RGPD imposent au responsable de traitement de fournir à la personne concernée différentes informations relatives notamment à son identité et ses coordonnées, aux finalités du traitement mis en œuvre, sa base juridique, les destinataires ou les catégories de destinataires des données, au fait que le responsable du traitement a l’intention d’effectuer un transfert de données vers un pays tiers. En outre, la réglementation impose, lorsque cela apparaît nécessaire pour garantir ""un traitement équitable et transparent"" des données personnelles en l’espèce, d’informer les personnes sur la durée de conservation des données, l’existence des différents droits dont bénéficient les personnes, l’existence du droit de retirer son consentement à tout moment et le droit d’introduire une réclamation auprès d’une autorité de contrôle. 36. L’article 14 du RGPD, qui concerne la situation dans laquelle les données à caractère personnel ne sont pas collectées directement auprès de la personne concernée, prévoit que cette dernière doit également être informée des catégories de données à caractère personnel concernées ainsi que, si cela est nécessaire pour garantir un traitement équitable et transparent, de la source dont proviennent ces données. En outre, il précise que ces informations doivent être communiquées à la personne concernée ""dans un délai raisonnable après avoir obtenu les données à caractère personnel, mais ne dépassant pas un mois, eu égard aux circonstances particulières dans lesquelles les données à caractère personnel sont traitées ou si les données à caractère personnel doivent être utilisées aux fins de la communication avec la personne concernée, au plus tard au moment de la première communication à ladite personne"" . 37. La rapporteure a relevé, ainsi qu’il ressort des constatations effectuées lors du contrôle sur place du 29 octobre 2019, que la SGAM AG2R LA MONDIALE confiait à ses sous-traitants \[…\] et \[…\] une partie des opérations de prospection téléphonique à mener auprès de ses clients et prospects. Dans ce cadre, la délégation de la CNIL a été informée que des scripts d’appels étaient établis par la société ou ses filiales et que 30% des conversations téléphoniques sortantes effectuées par ses deux sous-traitants étaient enregistrées à des fins d’amélioration de la qualité du service de la SGAM AG2R LA MONDIALE. 38. La rapporteure a relevé que l’écoute d’un échantillon des cinquante derniers appels téléphoniques passés par ces deux sous-traitants a permis de constater l’absence d’information des personnes contactées, soit du principe même de l’enregistrement de l’appel, soit de leur droit à s’y opposer. En outre, la rapporteure a également souligné que, dans le cadre de ces enregistrements, les personnes n’étaient rendues destinataires d’aucune information, même sommaire, relative au traitement de leurs données à caractère personnel ou aux autres droits dont elles disposent à l’égard de leurs données. Enfin, ces personnes ne se voyaient pas offrir la possibilité d’obtenir une information plus complète relative à la protection de leurs données à caractère personnel, par exemple via l’envoi d’un courriel ou l’activation d’une touche sur leur clavier téléphonique. 39. En défense, la société a indiqué avoir procédé à des rectifications immédiates, dès l’issue du contrôle sur place, afin de délivrer aux personnes concernées une information conforme aux exigences du RGPD. Elle a ainsi déclaré que, depuis la fin de l’année 2019, des instructions écrites relatives à l’information des personnes concernées étaient remises aux sous-traitants \[…\] et \[…\], tout comme des scripts d’appels téléphoniques actualisés contenant la plupart des mentions exigées par les articles 13 et 14 du RGPD. La société a précisé que lesdits scripts avaient été complétés avec d’ultimes mentions manquantes en 2021. Enfin, la société a indiqué qu’une notice d’information dédiée aux traitements mis en œuvre dans le cadre de l’enregistrement des appels téléphoniques sortants était désormais fournie au sein de la rubrique ""protection des données"" du site internet d’AG2R, indiquant la base légale du traitement et précisant les destinataires des enregistrements ainsi que les modalités d’exercice des droits. La société a précisé que les personnes démarchées téléphoniquement étaient désormais informées, par le téléopérateur, du fait qu’elles pouvaient consulter cette notice d’information en se rendant sur le site internet d’AG2R. 40. La formation restreinte relève qu’à la date du contrôle, les personnes démarchées téléphoniquement par les sociétés \[…\] et \[…\] pour le compte de la SGAM AG2R LA MONDIALE n’étaient pas correctement informées des traitements de données à caractère personnel mis en œuvre, en méconnaissance des dispositions applicables du RGPD. En effet, d’une part, les informations essentielles relatives en particulier au principe même de l’enregistrement de l’appel ou, selon les cas, au droit de s’y opposer, aux finalités de l’enregistrement et à sa durée de conservation, n’étaient pas communiquées aux personnes concernées par les sous-traitants de la SGAM AG2R LA MONDIALE. D’autre part, la formation restreinte souligne l’absence d’instructions données par la SGAM AG2R LA MONDIALE à ses sous-traitants afin de porter à la connaissance des personnes concernées les mentions d’information obligatoires prévues par le RGPD. En outre, elle relève que les scripts d’appels téléphoniques destinés au sous-traitant \[…\] ne contenaient aucune mention relative à la fourniture d’une quelconque information relative à la protection de leurs données à caractère personnel aux personnes concernées. 41. Au vu de ce qui précède, la formation restreinte considère qu’au jour du contrôle, la société ne respectait pas les dispositions des articles 13 et 14 du RGPD. 42. La formation restreinte relève néanmoins que, depuis le contrôle, la société s’est mise en conformité avec les exigences découlant des articles 13 et 14 du RGPD. A cet égard, la formation restreinte constate que les téléconseillers des prestataires \[…\] et \[…\] délivrent de manière effective une information aux personnes démarchées téléphoniquement concernant l’identité du responsable de traitement, le principe et la finalité de l’enregistrement de la conversation, les destinataires des enregistrements, leur durée de conservation, l’existence des droits dont disposent les personnes concernées, ainsi que la possibilité d’obtenir des informations complémentaires relatives aux traitements de données à caractère personnel mis en œuvre par la société en consultant la rubrique ""protection des données"" du site internet d’AG2R (au sein de laquelle est disponible la notice d’information dédiée aux traitements mis en œuvre dans le cadre de l’enregistrement des appels téléphoniques sortants). 43. Dès lors, la formation restreinte considère que les faits précités constituent un manquement aux articles 13 et 14 du RGPD, mais que la société a justifié s’être mise en conformité en fournissant, à la date de clôture de l’instruction, une information complète aux personnes démarchées téléphoniquement au sens des dispositions précitées. III. Sur les mesures correctrices et leur publicité 44. Aux termes du III de l’article 20 de la loi du 6 janvier 1978 modifiée : ""Lorsque le responsable de traitement ou son sous-traitant ne respecte pas les obligations résultant du règlement (UE) 2016/679 du 27 avril 2016 ou de la présente loi, le président de la Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés peut également, le cas échéant après lui avoir adressé l'avertissement prévu au I du présent article ou, le cas échéant en complément d'une mise en demeure prévue au II, saisir la formation restreinte de la commission en vue du prononcé, après procédure contradictoire, de l'une ou de plusieurs des mesures suivantes : \[…\] 2° Une injonction de mettre en conformité le traitement avec les obligations résultant du règlement (UE) 2016/679 du 27 avril 2016 ou de la présente loi ou de satisfaire aux demandes présentées par la personne concernée en vue d'exercer ses droits, qui peut être assortie, sauf dans des cas où le traitement est mis en œuvre par l'État, d'une astreinte dont le montant ne peut excéder 100 000 € par jour de retard à compter de la date fixée par la formation restreinte ; \[…\] 7° À l'exception des cas où le traitement est mis en œuvre par l'État, une amende administrative ne pouvant excéder 10 millions d'euros ou, s'agissant d'une entreprise, 2 % du chiffre d'affaires annuel mondial total de l'exercice précédent, le montant le plus élevé étant retenu. Dans les hypothèses mentionnées aux 5 et 6 de l'article 83 du règlement (UE) 2016/679 du 27 avril 2016, ces plafonds sont portés, respectivement, à 20 millions d'euros et 4 % dudit chiffre d'affaires. La formation restreinte prend en compte, dans la détermination du montant de l'amende, les critères précisés au même article 83."" 45. L’article 83 du RGPD prévoit que ""Chaque autorité de contrôle veille à ce que les amendes administratives imposées en vertu du présent article pour des violations du présent règlement visées aux paragraphes 4, 5 et 6 soient, dans chaque cas, effectives, proportionnées et dissuasives"", avant de préciser les éléments devant être pris en compte pour décider s’il y a lieu d’imposer une amende administrative et pour décider du montant de cette amende. 46. En premier lieu, la société fait valoir que si une amende devait être prononcée, la formation restreinte devrait tenir compte des mesures adoptées dans le sens d’une mise en conformité. S’agissant des durées de conservation des données des prospects, la société souligne que des actions correctrices ont été rapidement déployées afin de supprimer les données des prospects dont la durée maximale de conservation est atteinte et que des purges régulières sont désormais effectuées. S’agissant des durées de conservation des données des clients, elle rappelle que la complexité des systèmes d’information du groupe AG2R LA MONDIALE a retardé la mise en œuvre pleine et entière des durées légales de conservation, celle-ci étant toutefois en cours et déjà partiellement réalisée. Lors de la séance de la formation restreinte, la société a indiqué avoir investi au total \[…\] depuis plusieurs années. Par ailleurs, la société souligne que l’information délivrée aux personnes démarchées téléphoniquement respecte désormais les exigences des articles 13 et 14 du RGPD. La société invite enfin la formation restreinte à tenir compte de sa pleine coopération lors de la procédure et souligne une diminution de son chiffre d’affaires et de son résultat net. 47. La formation restreinte rappelle qu’elle doit tenir compte, pour le prononcé d’une amende administrative et pour la détermination de son montant, des critères précisés à l’article 83 du RGPD, tels que la nature, la gravité et la durée de la violation, les mesures prises par le responsable du traitement pour atténuer le dommage subi par les personnes concernées, le degré de coopération avec l’autorité de contrôle et les catégories de données à caractère personnel concernées par la violation. 48. En outre, la formation restreinte rappelle que dans la mesure où sont en l’espèce reprochés à la société des manquements aux articles 5-1-e), 13 et 14 du Règlement, le montant maximum de l’amende pouvant être retenu s’élève à 20 millions d’euros ou 4% du chiffre d’affaires annuel mondial, le montant le plus élevé étant retenu. 49. La formation restreinte considère tout d’abord que la société a fait preuve d’une négligence grave au regard de l’atteinte portée à des principes fondamentaux prévus par le RGPD, à savoir le principe de limitation de la durée de conservation des données et l’obligation d’informer les personnes concernées des traitements de leurs données à caractère personnel. 50. La formation restreinte relève ensuite que le manquement relatif aux durées de conservation a concerné un nombre très important de personnes, en particulier des clients de la société. En effet, la conservation en base active pour des durées supérieures aux durées légales autorisées, pouvant excéder trente ans, a concerné les données à caractère personnel de plus de deux millions de clients collectées lors de la conclusion de contrats d’assurance. 51. La formation restreinte souligne par ailleurs que, parmi les données des clients conservées pour des durées excessives, figurent des données de nature sensible, des coordonnées bancaires et des informations relatives à la vie personnelle des clients. 52. La formation restreinte relève également que les mesures de mise en conformité mises en place à la suite du contrôle n’ont pas permis de remédier entièrement au manquement relatif aux durées de conservation des données en tant qu’il concerne les clients, lequel persiste encore partiellement à ce jour. En tout état de cause, les mesures de mise en conformité adoptées n’exonèrent pas la société de sa responsabilité pour le passé. 53. De plus, la formation restreinte considère que les investissements réalisés par la société pour parvenir à la mise en œuvre des durées de conservation définies dans ses systèmes d’information ne sont pas disproportionnés au regard de son chiffre d’affaires, de la taille du groupe et de l’ampleur des travaux à réaliser compte tenu de la complexité desdits systèmes d’information soulignée par la société elle-même, qui préexistait à l’entrée en application du RGPD. La formation restreinte considère que c’est précisément le manque d’anticipation qui a contribué à des échecs dans la mise en œuvre des durées de conservation des données des clients de la société au sein de ses systèmes et, partant, à l’absence de mise en conformité avec le RGPD plus de trois ans après son entrée en application. 54. Enfin, la formation restreinte rappelle que les amendes administratives doivent être dissuasives mais proportionnées. Elle considère en particulier que l’activité de la société et sa situation financière doivent être prises en compte pour la détermination de la sanction et notamment, en cas d’amende administrative, de son montant. Elle relève à ce titre que la société fait état d’une diminution de son chiffre d’affaires, passé de 9,7 milliards en 2019 à 9,3 milliards en 2020, comme de son résultat net, passé de 350 millions en 2019 à 222 millions en 2020. Si la formation restreinte constate le résultat net a diminué de manière assez significative, elle souligne que celui-ci reste largement positif. Au vu de ces éléments, la formation restreinte considère que le prononcé d’une amende de 1 750 000 euros apparaît justifié, compte tenu notamment de la nécessité de sanctionner des manquements à des principes élémentaires du RGPD, commis par un acteur majeur de la protection sociale en France, concernant plusieurs millions de personnes et portant sur des données de nature sensible ou particulière, comme les coordonnées bancaires. 55. En conséquence, la formation restreinte considère qu’il y a lieu de prononcer une amende administrative de 1 750 000 euros au regard des manquements aux articles 5-1-e), 13 et 14 du RGPD. 56. En deuxième lieu, une injonction de mettre en conformité le traitement avec les dispositions des articles 5-1-e), 13 et 14 du RGPD a été proposée par la rapporteure dans son rapport de sanction. 57. En défense, la société soutient que les actions qu’elle a mises en œuvre s’agissant de l’ensemble des manquements relevés doivent conduire à ne pas donner suite à la proposition d’injonctions de la rapporteure. 58. S’agissant du manquement à l’obligation de définir et de respecter une durée de conservation des données à caractère personnel proportionnée à la finalité du traitement en application de l’article 5-1-e) du RGPD, la société indique avoir entrepris de nombreuses actions et avoir réalisé les investissements conséquents susmentionnés pour atteindre la mise en conformité sur ce point. 59. La formation restreinte relève, s’agissant des données des prospects, que la société met désormais en œuvre les durées de conservation définies par la société dans son référentiel, qui sont proportionnées aux finalités poursuivies et au demeurant conformes aux recommandations faites par la CNIL en la matière. S’agissant des données des clients, la société témoigne s’être engagée dans une démarche sérieuse de mise en conformité. A cet égard, la formation restreinte note d’ailleurs que la société documente avoir mené à bien une partie importante de la mise en oeuvre de ces durées de conservation dans ces systèmes, seuls restant à couvrir une partie résiduelle du périmètre ""Santé Prévoyance"" ainsi que le périmètre ""Epargne et retraite supplémentaire"" , et que la société s’est engagée à achever sa mise en conformité au 31 décembre 2022. 60. S’agissant du manquement à l’obligation d’information des personnes en application des articles 13 et 14 du RGPD, la formation restreinte prend acte de la mise en conformité de la société sur ce point. En effet, la société démontre avoir envoyé des instructions écrites à ses prestataires afin que soit délivrée une information complète aux personnes démarchées téléphoniquement pour son compte, et y avoir joint des scripts d’appels complétés des mentions d’information obligatoires. Par ailleurs, l’écoute des échantillons d’appels téléphoniques communiqués par la société atteste de la délivrance effective de ces informations aux personnes concernées. En outre, une notice d’information dédiée à ces traitements et contenant des informations complémentaires a été insérée au sein de la politique de confidentialité. La personne est désormais systématiquement informée par le téléopérateur, au début de l’appel téléphonique, du fait qu’elle peut prendre connaissance de cette notice en se rendant sur le site internet d’AG2R. 61. Au vu de ce qui précède, la formation restreinte considère qu’il n’y a plus lieu de maintenir les injonctions proposées. 62. En troisième lieu, la formation restreinte considère que la publicité de la sanction se justifie au regard du fait que les manquements aux principes élémentaires du RGPD relevés en l’espèce concernent un acteur majeur de la protection sociale et patrimoniale en France, qui gère les données à caractère personnel de millions de personnes. La formation restreinte relève que dans ce contexte, la publicité de la sanction permet d’informer les personnes concernées de la nature et de l’étendue de ces manquements. PAR CES MOTIFS La formation restreinte de la CNIL, après en avoir délibéré, décide de : - prononcer à l’encontre de la SGAM AG2R LA MONDIALE une amende administrative d’un montant de 1 750 000 (un million sept-cent-cinquante-mille) euros ; - rendre publique, sur le site de la CNIL et sur le site de Légifrance, sa délibération, qui n’identifiera plus nommément la société à l’expiration d’un délai d’un an à compter de sa publication. Le président Alexandre LINDEN Cette décision est susceptible de faire l’objet d’un recours devant le Conseil d’État dans un délai de deux mois à compter de sa notification."

Facts and procedure 1. Company X (hereinafter “Company The X group was acquired in June 2018 by the German ZZ group. 2. Company 3. During the month of May 2019, an article published in the newspaper "" \[...\]"" as well as two documentaries broadcast on the channel "" \[...\]"" revealed that between 2016 and 2017, companies Y (which became company XY) and company XX had created, on behalf of company of the environmental cause, scientists and farmers, as part of the campaign for the renewal of the authorization for the use of \[...\] by the European Commission. 4. Between May and September 2019, the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties (hereinafter “the CNIL” or “the Commission”) received seven complaints (referrals nos. 19009370, 19009429, 19009432 , 19009439, 19009604, 19009666, 19017095) against the company in which the complainants indicated in particular that they had not been informed of the existence of this processing of their personal data. 5. Pursuant to decisions No. 2019-098C and No. 2019-099C of May 13, 2019 and No. 2019-111C of June 26, 2019 of the President of the Commission, a delegation from the CNIL carried out the following control operations : - a documentary check, by sending a letter requesting documents on May 15, 2019 to company Y (which became company XY on January 1, 2017); - a hearing of company Y on January 21, 2020; - a documentary check, by sending a letter requesting documents on May 14, 2019, to company XX; - a documentary check, by sending a questionnaire on August 6, 2019, to company X. 6. The purpose of these missions was to verify compliance by these companies with all the provisions of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter ""the Data Protection Act” or “the law of January 6, 1978”) and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter “the GDPR” or “the Regulation”). In particular, this involved carrying out investigations in connection with the processing carried out at the request of company organize personal data with a view to carrying out a mission of representing interests concerning the use of \[...\] in Europe and around the world. 7. It emerges from the investigations carried out by the CNIL control delegation that, through a framework contract for the provision of services dated July 18, 2013, supplemented by three amendments and four specifications, company Y - which became the company XY on January 1, 2017 - a mission to represent interests concerning the use of \[...\] in Europe and around the world, from 2016 until May 31, 2019. 8. Indeed, among its activities, the company develops and markets phytosanitary products. The best known of them is \[…\], one of the active substances of which is \[…\]. With a view to the renewal of the authorization of \[...\] by the European Commission, which finally took place on November 27, 2017, company . 9. As part of this service, company Y carried out the identification and inventory of information relating to personalities involved in the debate on the renewal of the authorization to use \[...\] in Europe , which notably resulted in the development and maintenance of a list of “stakeholders” involved in this campaign. This file, entitled "" \[...\]"", included a list of 201 people residing in France, including members of environmental protection associations, farmers' associations, associations in the field of health, professional organizations, political figures, members of administrations, journalists, academics and farmers. For each of these people, the following information was provided: home organization and website, position held, professional address, professional landline number, mobile telephone number, professional email address and, where applicable, Twitter account "". 10. In addition, a score ranging from 1 to 5 was assigned to each person, in order to assess their influence, credibility and support for company genetically modified organisms, environment, food and health. 11. The file also included a free comment area in which the events these people had attended or which they had organized, the people with whom they worked, the contacts they had had with representatives of the company could be indicated. X or the articles they had published on the subject of \[...\]. 12. In addition, between 2016 and 2017, company Y notably commissioned company XX, on behalf of company X, to identify influential people in the public debate in France, to produce analysis notes relating to electoral trends in France and to monitor the media on French legislative and political news in connection with the debate on the renewal of the authorization for the use of \[...\] in Europe. Company Y ended the mission of company XX in April 2017. 13. In order to examine these elements, the President of the Commission appointed Ms. Valérie PEUGEOT as rapporteur, on November 5, 2020, on the basis of article 22 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended. 14. At the end of her investigation, the rapporteur had a bailiff serve on company Also attached to the report was a summons to the restricted training session on April 1, 2021, indicating to the company that it could produce its observations in response no later than March 16, 2021. 15. This report proposed to the restricted panel of the Commission to impose an administrative fine on company X. He also proposed that this decision be made public and no longer allow the company to be identified by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. 16. On March 15, 2021, the company filed comments in response. On March 23, 2021, the rapporteur asked the president of the restricted formation, on the basis of article 40, paragraph 4, of decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 taken for the application of the Data Protection Act (hereinafter ""the decree of May 29, 2019""), additional time to respond to the company's observations, which was granted to it on March 25, 2021. This information was brought to the company's attention the same day. She was also informed that the restricted training session initially scheduled for April 1 was postponed to a later date. 17. On March 23, 2021, the company made a request for the session of the restricted panel to be held behind closed doors, a request which was rejected by the president of the restricted panel, by letter of April 8, 2021. 18. The rapporteur responded to the company's observations on April 9, 2021. The same day, the secretary general of the CNIL informed the company that the restricted training session would be held on May 20, 2021. 19. On May 5, 2021, the company presented new observations in response to those of the rapporteur. 20. The company and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the restricted training session. II. Reasons for decision A. On the complaint relating to the impartiality of the procedure 21. Company XX during the checks would not have been transmitted to him. She also underlines that neither the CNIL services nor the rapporteur carried out her hearing while company Y was heard by the CNIL control delegation. It further emphasizes that company Y had every interest in attributing responsibility for the processing implemented to company X. 22. The company also criticizes the rapporteur for having only retained evidence against it and for having excluded certain documents from the debates. She further notes that certain documents annexed to the rapporteur's report have been partially obscured, thus depriving her of the right to effectively prepare her defense. In particular, the company complains that the impact study carried out by company Y was not communicated to it. It further notes that the audit report carried out by the company YY following the publication of the press articles and the broadcast of the reports, an audit which was carried out at the request of the company zz and whose report demonstrates the absence of the disputed file within the information system of company X, is not discussed by the rapporteur. 23. First of all, the restricted panel notes that the minutes of the hearing of the representatives of company Y, carried out by the CNIL control delegation on January 21, 2020, are part of the documents annexed to the sanction report which was was notified to the company on February 15, 2021 as well as all the other documents on which the rapporteur based her analysis and her proposal as part of the procedure. Thus, as provided for in Article 40 of Decree No. 2019 536 of May 29, 2019, the company had the opportunity to make written observations in response to the rapporteur's report and therefore to question any declaration made by company Y which she considered to be erroneous or misleading. Moreover, the restricted training emphasizes that the company also had the opportunity to produce new observations in response to those of the rapporteur and, finally, it was able to develop its arguments during the session of the restricted training of 20 May 2021, in accordance with article 42 of the aforementioned decree. Company X was therefore able to submit its observations at different stages of the procedure, in accordance with the applicable provisions. 24. Secondly, the restricted panel notes that the choice of the rapporteur to annex to her sanction report only the elements useful for characterizing the breaches which she considered the company to be accused of, and not all of the elements collected as part of the control procedures, in no way hinders the company's rights of defense. Indeed, on the one hand, the rapporteur was able to freely consider that certain documents were not useful for her demonstration and, on the other hand, as explained in the previous point, the adversarial procedure organized by the “Informatique et Libertés” law. and the decree taken for its application allowed the company to produce any document it considered useful to its defense. 25. Concerning the fact that certain documents communicated by the rapporteur contain concealments, the restricted panel notes that the rapporteur indicated that these concealments related to information protected by business secrecy, unrelated to this procedure, or to personal data. The restricted panel also notes that during its response to the company's observations dated April 9, 2021, the rapporteur finally communicated to the company several of these documents in their full version. 26. The restricted panel recalls, moreover, that it was not made recipient of the unhidden versions of these documents, so that it is not aware of any additional element which would not have been communicated to the company as part of the procedure. In any event, the restricted panel specifies that the concealments in question in no way distorted its understanding of the case and had no impact on its decision-making. 27. Thirdly, with regard to the absence of a hearing of the company, the restricted panel firstly notes that a documentary inspection of company X was carried out by a delegation from the CNIL, which This is translated by sending a questionnaire asking about the implementation of the processing in question, to which the company responded. The restricted panel thus observes that the company was heard during the procedure, in compliance with the applicable legal provisions, the documentary control constituting one of the four forms of control provided for by article 19 of the Data Protection Act. Freedoms. Then, it recalls that the hearing by the rapporteur of the body against which a sanction procedure has been initiated is only an option which is offered to the rapporteur by article 39 of the aforementioned decree and not an obligatory step of the procedure. The restricted panel further notes that the company did not request a hearing directly from the rapporteur either. In view of the above, the restricted panel considers that the procedure followed in the present proceedings is not tainted by irregularity. B. On the status of data controller of company X 28. Under Article 4 (7) of the GDPR, the data controller is defined as ""the natural or legal person, public authority, service or other body which, alone or jointly with others , determines the purposes and means of the processing. 29. The rapporteur considers that in this case, company takes place and how its objective is to be achieved. Indeed, the file in question was intended to enable company \] by the European Commission. She thus recalls that it is to achieve this objective that she decided to entrust to company Y all activities linked to public relations and the reputation of the company and, more particularly from 2016, a mission representation of interests concerning the use of \[...\] in Europe and in the world and that it is within the framework of this mission that the file named "" \[...\] "" was established. 30. In defense, the company considers that responsibility for the processing fell exclusively to company Y and that the rapporteur confuses the notions of beneficiary of a service and that of data controller. She emphasizes that it was company Y which, in its capacity as a company specializing in consulting and public relations, constructed the file autonomously, according to a methodology that it itself defined, then which proposed to Company X. 31. The company emphasizes that it is because of the expertise of company Y that it used its services and that the creation of lists of names is a common practice in this sector of activity. She recalls that she never gave instructions to company Y as to how to carry out this mission and that she only reacted to the proposals made by the latter. 32. Company X further explains that, dissatisfied with the result obtained, it never used the file in question. However, she notes that if she had acted as data controller, she would have asked company Y to modify the file as she saw fit in order to obtain a result more in line with her expectations. 33. The company further indicates that company Y presents itself on its website as the data controller of the data processed within the framework of the missions entrusted to it by its clients. It also recalls that it was company Y which responded to the requests to exercise the rights of the data subjects in connection with the processing in question. 34. Firstly, the restricted training recalls that the data controller is the person who determines the purposes of the processing implemented, that is to say the expected or sought result, and the means of this processing, i.e. that is, how to achieve this result. 35. The notions of data controller and processor are clarified by the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter ""the EDPS"") in its guidelines 07/2020 adopted on September 2, 2020 and subject to public consultation . The EDPS states that ""Determining the purposes and means amounts to deciding respectively the ""why"" and the ""how"" of the processing: with regard to a particular processing operation, the controller is the actor who determined why the processing takes place (i.e. ""for what purpose"" or ""for what purpose"") and how this aim is to be achieved (i.e. what means are to be used to achieve the aim ).A natural or legal person who exercises such influence over the processing of personal data thus participates in determining the purposes and means of such processing in accordance with the definition in Article 4(7) of the GDPR. controller must decide both the purpose and the means of processing described below. Therefore, the controller cannot determine only the purpose. He must also make decisions on the means of processing. Conversely, the party acting as processor can never determine the purpose of the processing. 36. In the present case, it is not disputed that company It is in order to achieve this objective that the company decided that the way to achieve this was to launch an interest representation campaign for the purposes of which it was necessary to establish the mapping of the stakeholders in the debate on the renewal of the authorization for the use of \[...\] in the European Union. It is to achieve this result that company X called on company Y, a company specializing in activities related to public relations. 37. The restricted panel notes that by a framework contract for the provision of services dated July 18, 2013 (exhibit no. 14 annexed to the sanction report), company public relations and strategic communications consulting agency, missions linked to the reputation of the company. From the signing on August 5, 2016 of amendment no. 13 (exhibit no. 17 annexed to the sanction report), company Y was more specifically responsible for establishing the list of ""stakeholders"". ) as part of the campaign for the renewal of the authorization of \[...\] in Europe. 38. The need for company is to add an additional layer to the stakeholder mapping in order to have a clearer picture of who is currently discussing \[...\], what they are saying about it and where they are saying it"" (free translation). This request was included in amendment no. 7 dated October 15, 2016 (exhibit no. 16 annexed to the sanction report), which was renewed numerous times until May 31, 2019. It thus appears that the company Y was explicitly required to establish the list of stakeholders as part of the campaign for the renewal of the authorization of \[...\] in Europe. 39. Secondly, the restricted panel notes that, contrary to what Company stakeholders involved in the debate on \[...\], an activity which notably resulted in the development of the file in question. Furthermore, the very regular exchanges between the two companies show that company to the organization of meetings involving representatives of the two companies. The documents annexed to the sanction report thus attest to the involvement of company company X to monitor the progress of the tasks entrusted to Y and the delivery of the work completed or in progress. 40. The restricted panel considers that these exchanges demonstrate that company Y reported to company management power over the activities of company Y, thus depriving it of the autonomy normally enjoyed by a data controller. These elements demonstrate that company Y acted as a subcontractor of company X, within the meaning of article 4(8) of the GDPR. 41. The restricted panel finally notes that the circumstance that company on the fact that it was she who, through the directives given to Y, defined in advance the purposes and means of the processing which was implemented with a view in particular to establishing this file. 42. Thirdly, the restricted panel considers that it cannot be inferred from the mere fact that company Y proposed a stakeholder monitoring strategy to company X that the latter can be qualified as a data controller. 43. The restricted panel emphasizes on the contrary that it is the fact for company X, the ordering company, to decide to accept the proposal made by company Y, and to contractually ask it to carry out operations on its behalf as a provider, who made the treatment possible. Indeed, if company X had refused this proposal, company Y would not have implemented this treatment. It follows from the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) that the fact of resorting to processing of personal data which has been designed by another actor and on which the sponsor can only make certain settings ( CJEU, June 5, 2018, Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein, C-210/16), or even no configuration (CJEU, July 29, 2019, Fashion ID GmbH & Co. KG, C-40/17) does not exempt anyone who resorts to this processing in its capacity as data controller. The Court also specifies that ""a natural or legal person who influences, for their own purposes, the processing of personal data and therefore participates in determining the purposes and means of this processing, may be considered to be responsible for the processing, within the meaning of Article 2(d), of Directive 95/46"" (CJEU, July 10, 2018, Tietosuojavaltuutettu/Jehovan todistajat, C-25/17). 44. Finally, the restricted panel considers that the fact of company Y having responded to requests for access rights does not necessarily qualify it as a data controller. Indeed, article 28-3-e of the GDPR provides that the subcontractor ""helps the data controller, through appropriate technical and organizational measures, to the greatest extent possible, to fulfill its obligation to provide following requests made by the persons concerned in order to exercise their rights. Thus, with regard to the specificities of the processing, the subcontractor can itself respond to people's requests if this measure allows better respect for people's rights. It is also common for it to be the subcontractor who is best able to process requests to exercise rights. The restricted panel therefore considers, taking into account these elements, that company X must be qualified as data controller. C. On the competence of the CNIL 45. Article 55-1 of the GDPR provides that “each supervisory authority is competent to exercise the missions and powers with which it is vested in accordance with this regulation in the territory of the Member State to which it falls”. 46. Article 8-2° of the Data Protection Act further specifies that “the National Commission for Information Technology and Freedoms (…) ensures that the processing of personal data is implemented in accordance with the provisions of this law and other provisions relating to the protection of personal data provided for by legislative and regulatory texts, European Union law and France's international commitments"". 47. Thus, the CNIL is competent to ensure, on French territory, that the processing operations to which the provisions of the GDPR or the amended one of January 6, 1978 apply are implemented in accordance with the provisions of these texts. 48. Firstly, Article 3-1) of the GDPR provides “this regulation applies to the processing of personal data carried out within the framework of the activities of an establishment of a data controller or a processor within the territory of the Union, whether or not the processing takes place in the Union"". 49. It follows that the CNIL is competent to ensure compliance with the provisions of the GDPR of the processing of personal data implemented within the framework of the activities of an establishment of a subcontractor of a data controller. , when this establishment is located in France. 50. In the present case, the restricted panel notes that it appears from the documents in the file that the subsidiary of the company Y INC. based in Paris, the company Y France (now XY), was notably involved in the processing of personal data corresponding to the identification and mapping of stakeholders in the debate on the renewal of the authorization of the \[...\] \], which resulted in the creation of the file \[...\] ""(exhibit no. 13 annexed to the sanction report). 51. The CNIL is therefore competent, on the basis of article 3-1) of the GDPR, to examine the processing of personal data implemented within the framework of the establishment of the file ""\[...\] "" by the company Y France. 52. Secondly, under Article 3(2)(b) of the GDPR, the provisions of the Regulation apply ""to the processing of personal data relating to data subjects who are located in the territory of the GDPR Union by a controller or a processor who is not established in the Union, when the processing activities are linked (…) to the monitoring of the behavior of these persons, insofar as it concerns 'behavior which takes place within the Union'. 53. Furthermore, article 3 of the Data Protection Act provides that “the national rules taken on the basis of the provisions of the same regulation referring to national law the care of adapting or supplementing the rights and obligations provided for by this regulation apply when the person concerned resides in France, including when the data controller is not established in France. 54. It follows from these provisions that the CNIL is competent to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act and the GDPR with regard to the processing of personal data relating to the monitoring of the behavior of persons since these persons reside in France, in the event of tracking activity based on individual profiles, regardless of where the data controller is established. 55. In view of the above, the restricted panel notes that as part of its mission of representing interests on behalf of company stakeholders involved in the debate on the renewal of the authorization for the use of \[...\] in the European Union. The processing thus implemented proceeds from monitoring the behavior of the persons concerned within the meaning of the provisions of article 3-2)-b) of the GDPR and therefore falls within the territorial scope of the GDPR and the provisions of the Data Protection Act. and Freedoms, regardless of the place of establishment of the data controller. D. On the applicability of the GDPR to the facts of the case 56. The rapporteur underlines that the processing of personal data corresponding to the identification and mapping of the stakeholders in the debate on the renewal of the authorization of \[...\], which took the form in particular of the development of the file \[...\] "", began in 2016 but continued until 2019, i.e. after the entry into application of the GDPR, as explicitly emerges from the specifications of the addendum No. 7, signed on October 15, 2016 and renewed numerous times until 2019. 57. The rapporteur considers that the alleged absence of modification of the file after 2017 cannot succeed insofar as the modification is not the only processing operation capable of prolonging the characterization of the breaches. It notes that under Article 4(2) of the GDPR, storage, copying or consultation constitute processing operations. She recalls on this point that company X was the recipient of the file in question and kept it as part of the archiving of its employees' emails. 58. However, the rapporteur notes that at a minimum, the reception, consultation and conservation of a file including personal data, established as part of processing whose purposes and means have been defined by the The interested party constitutes, for this data controller, a processing operation. 59. The rapporteur therefore considers that, the retention of the file by the company having continued over a long period of time, some of the breaches committed by the company are continuous breaches which began before the entry into force of the GDPR but continued afterwards. 60. The company considers for its part that the GDPR is not applicable to the facts of the case insofar as the disputed file, named "" \[...\] "" dates, in its most complete version, from August 22 2016. It notes that even if the restricted training was based on the declarations of company Y, which indicated to the CNIL that the file had not been updated after April 2017, the applicable law would be that in force at that time, and not the GDPR. She also emphasizes that companies Y and XX are not able to produce this file in an updated version after August 2016 or even find discussions on this subject. The company also indicates that the metadata of the file shows that it was last updated on December 19, 2016. 61. The company then emphasizes that amendment no. 7 which supplemented the framework contract for the provision of services concluded with company Y was signed in October 2016, i.e. after the creation of the file, and that this amendment could not therefore not concern the creation of the file in question. It further notes that the subsequent continuation of commercial relations with company Y does not imply that the processing linked to the file continued, given that the relations between the two companies were not simply limited to this processing. Finally, it argues that the simple fact that the file in question may have been kept in the storage space of an employee's professional email does not mean that the processing of the personal data contained in this file would have continued. 62. The company therefore considers that the disputed facts took place entirely before the entry into force of the GDPR and that it is, therefore, the “Informatique et Libertés” law in its version in force on August 22, 2016, or even on later in its version in force in April 2017, which should be applied to the facts of the case. According to the company, this implies that the CNIL should have sent it a formal notice prior to initiating a sanction procedure. 63. Firstly, the restricted panel notes that company \[...\]. This request was made in the framework contract for the provision of services of July 18, 2013 and then in amendment no. 13 of August 5, 2016, which explicitly provided for the creation of a map of the stakeholders in the debate relating to the \[...\] \]. The restricted training underlines that this request for identification of stakeholders was included in a second amendment dated October 15, 2016, identified as ""amendment no. 7"", which was renewed numerous times until 2019 , notably September 1, 2018 and January 1, 2019. 64. The maintenance of the file entitled ""\[...\]"", bringing together personal data collected by company Y, was therefore carried out as part of the service of identification, census and mapping of stakeholders which, it lasted until 2019. 65. In this regard, the restricted panel considers that the circumstance that this file was modified for the last time no later than April 2017, i.e. prior to the entry into application of the GDPR, has no effect on the persistence of the processing of personal data, as long as the file concerned continues to exist in the information system of the company in question, or of one of its service providers acting on its behalf, until a date after entry into force. application of the GDPR. In this case, the file was indeed kept in the electronic mail archives of an employee of company X. 66. The restricted training recalls that simple storage constitutes processing of personal data. Thus, since as data controller, company in its own right extend the existence of this file beyond the entry into application of the GDPR. 67. The restricted training also underlines that the creation of this file is part of a broader objective of identification, census and mapping of stakeholders in the debate on the renewal of \[...\]. On this point, amendment no. 7, renewed in particular on September 1, 2018 and January 1, 2019, explicitly contains instructions intended to update stakeholder maps, which corresponds well to the objective pursued by the disputed file . 68. Thus, if the services requested by company the conservation of this file, continued after the entry into force of this text. 69. Secondly, the restricted training notes that the failures relating to the information of individuals and the supervision of relations between the data controller and its subcontractor are continuous failures which persisted after the entry into application of the GDPR. She emphasizes that if the company informed people, through the YY firm in 2019, this information is subsequent to the entry into application of the GDPR and that it was only carried out after the revelation of the facts in the press. However, it was up to the company to ensure, itself or through its subcontractor, the information of individuals, either under the provisions applicable before the entry into force of the GDPR (in particular at the time of the creation of the file), or under the GDPR, to regularize the situation, after its entry into force. The restricted training also notes that the obligation to inform people whose data has not been collected from them already appeared in article 32-III of the law “Informatique et Libertés” in its version in in force on August 5, 2016, the date on which amendment No. 13 providing for the development of the file was signed. Likewise, although having a different scope, the obligation for a data controller to regulate its relations with its subcontractor through a legal act was provided for by article 35 of the “Informatique et Libertés” law. 70. The restricted panel recalls on this point that in its decision of March 1, 2021, Société Futura Internationale, no. 437808, the Council of State confirmed that the CNIL could sanction, on the basis of the GDPR, a continuous breach started before its entry into application and continued afterwards. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that the “Informatique et Libertés” law, in its version prior to the entry into application of the GDPR, then the GDPR are applicable to the facts of the case. E. On the failure to comply with the obligation to inform the persons concerned pursuant to Article 14 of the GDPR 71. Article 14 of the GDPR provides that when personal data have not been collected from the person concerned by the processing, the data controller provides the latter with the elements referred to in this same article ""within a period reasonable after obtaining the personal data, but not exceeding one month, having regard to the particular circumstances in which the personal data are processed"" or ""if it is envisaged to communicate the information to another recipient, at most late when the personal data are communicated for the first time. "" 72. The rapporteur notes that the persons whose personal data were collected and processed in this case were only informed of this processing in 2019, when company Z, after having acquired company to inform people through the YY firm. It considers that none of the exceptions to the obligation to inform individuals provided for in Article 14(5) of the GDPR can be used in this case. 73. In defense, company She considers that this obligation fell on company Y, which had control over the data contained in the file. She explains that in any event, informing people would have been of little interest to the extent that the data in question was public, that the people concerned could reasonably expect that their data would be the subject of such treatment and that she ultimately never used this file. 74. Firstly, it appears to the restricted training that processing of personal data, consisting of the collection of information aimed at identifying the influential people with whom a company wishes to represent its interests can, subject to certain conditions , be carried out on the basis of the legitimate interest pursued by the data controller. Indeed, processing such as that in question may be justified by the pursuit of the legitimate interest of the data controller provided that the interests and fundamental rights of the persons concerned do not prevail over the interests of the data controller. This balancing between the different interests involved requires in particular taking into account the reasonable expectations of the persons concerned as to the nature of the data collected and the way in which they are processed for the constitution of the processing in dispute, as provided for in recital 47 of the GDPR. 75. In the present case, the restricted panel notes that the persons whose data appeared in the disputed file could reasonably expect that company X, or more generally organizations whose activity is the representation of interests, would are interested in their position in the debate linked to \[...\], and processes their professional contact details as well as information relating to their public positions. 76. Indeed, the people present in the file in question took part in the public debate on the use of \[...\] or subjects linked to this theme, whether in particular through the development of decisions public, their influence on the representation or management of companies or public and private organizations notoriously involved in ecological and environmental subjects or even taking a public position or active participation in these debates. Therefore, these people could reasonably expect that actors in the sector in which they intervened would collect information concerning them from publicly and lawfully accessible data in order to know and understand their positions and possibly enter into contact with them. . 77. The restricted training notes that in all cases, the data controller who implements such processing must ensure compliance with the obligations provided for by the GDPR and in particular the obligation to inform people in order in particular that those they can exercise their rights. 78. The restricted training thus recalls that under Article 14 of the GDPR, the information that the data controller must provide to the data subject is, in particular, the identity and contact details of the data controller (and the case where applicable, the contact details of the data protection officer), the purposes of the processing, its legal basis, the categories of personal data concerned, where applicable the recipients or categories of recipients of the data, the fact that the controller intends to transfer the data to a third country as well as, if this is necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing, the duration of data retention, the existence of the various rights enjoyed by individuals, the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, the source from which the data comes and the possible existence of automated decision-making. 79. The provision of this information allows the data subject to exercise their rights with the data controller. It thus contributes to making the activity of interest representation more transparent. 80. Secondly, the restricted panel recalls that under the terms of Article 14(5)(b) of the GDPR, this information obligation is not imposed when ""the provision of such information proves impossible or would require disproportionate efforts” or when compliance with this information obligation “is likely to make impossible or seriously compromise the achievement of the objectives of said processing”. 81. With regard to the exceptions provided for in Article 14(5)(b) cited above, the restricted panel notes that the information of the persons appearing in the file entitled "" \[...\] "" would not have required the company X made disproportionate efforts and was, therefore, necessary. The restricted training first emphasizes that the file in question concerned more than 200 people and that the company had contact information for almost all of them such as an address, a telephone number or an address. electronic messaging. 82. The restricted panel recalls in this regard that, in its decision of March 12, 2014, Société Pages Jaunes Groupe, n°353193, the Council of State considered that the information by the data controller of 25 million people concerned by the collection of their personal data was not impossible and did not constitute a ""disproportionate effort"", taking into account the interest attached to respecting the fundamental freedoms and rights of these persons, particularly since the data controller had useful contact details to contact them. 83. The restricted panel also notes that the people concerned were finally informed individually in 2019, through the YY firm, which demonstrates that information was entirely possible. 84. It does not then appear that the provision of information to data subjects relating to the processing carried out would have been likely to make it impossible or seriously compromise the achievement of the objectives of said processing. Indeed, the restricted training notes that the legislative framework for the activity of interest representatives is evolving towards increased transparency both at the level of the European Union and at the national level. On this point, the French Association of Lobbying and Public Affairs Consultants defines lobbying as “the representation of interests (…) through contradictory and balanced information sharing”, which appears incompatible with an exercise of this activity in an opaque manner, without the knowledge of the persons concerned. 85. Finally, the restricted panel notes that the circumstances invoked by company and that this file has never been used by the company, do not constitute reasons likely to exempt the data controller from his obligation to provide information with regard to the provisions of Article 14 of the GDPR. In addition, contrary to what the company maintains, the responsibility for ensuring that the information has been delivered to the data subjects lies with the data controller and not with the subcontractor. Therefore, the restricted panel considers that the aforementioned facts constitute a breach of Article 14 of the GDPR. F. On the failure to comply with the obligation to regulate by a formalized legal act the processing carried out on behalf of the data controller 86. Article 28 of the Regulation provides that when processing is carried out by a processor, this processing is governed by a contract or other legal act which defines the object and duration of the processing, the nature and the purpose processing, the type of personal data, the categories of data subjects as well as the obligations and rights of the data controller. This contract also provides for the conditions under which the subcontractor undertakes to carry out processing operations on behalf of the controller. 87. The rapporteur notes that in this case, the processing relating to mapping between stakeholders was the subject of several successive contracts and amendments between companies X and Y but that none of them contains the information provided for in Article 28 of the GDPR. 88. In defense, the company recalls that, for the reasons already expressed in points 30 to 33, it was not acting as data controller and that, consequently, the obligation provided for by Article 28 of the GDPR does not is not opposable to him. 89. The restricted panel recalls that for the reasons set out in points 34 to 43, company X must be considered as acting as data controller and company Y as subcontractor. 90. The restricted panel notes that the processing of personal data in question, carried out by company Y within the framework of the mission of representing interests entrusted to it by company X, finds its origin in the framework contract of services signed between the two companies on July 18, 2013. This framework contract was supplemented by several amendments, in particular by amendment No. 7, the specifications of which were regularly renewed until May 2019. 91. However, the restricted panel notes that none of these acts concluded between the two companies from May 25, 2018, the date on which the obligation contained in Article 28 of the GDPR became applicable, contains the information provided for in this article 28. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that these facts constitute a breach of Article 28 of the GDPR. III. On corrective measures and publicity 92. Under the terms of III of article 20 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended: ""When the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or of this law, the president of the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties may also, where applicable after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, where appropriate in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted formation of the commission with a view to pronouncing, after adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures: \[…\]7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the total annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is greater. the hypotheses mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted panel takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83. 93. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that ""Each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this article for violations of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive"", before specifying the elements to be taken into account when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and when deciding the amount of this fine. 94. In defense, company in this case and that, therefore, a formal notice should necessarily have been notified to him before a sanction procedure could be initiated, which could lead to the imposition of an administrative fine. 95. The company points out that apart from the fact that it does not have the status of data controller, the data appearing in the disputed file had all been made public by the persons concerned. It therefore considers that the damage suffered by them is low. 96. Furthermore, the company considers that the amount of the fine proposed by the rapporteur is disproportionate in view of the seriousness of the alleged breaches but also taking into account the recent sanction deliberations rendered by the restricted panel. 97. Finally, regarding the publicity of the sanction, the company emphasizes that it has already been widely exposed in the media in 2019 for the same facts. She considers that a public sanction would cause a new media wave damaging to her image. 98. Firstly, the restricted panel notes that the failure to comply with the obligation to inform the persons concerned infringed the rights of the latter, to the extent that, not having knowledge of what their personal data were processed by the company, these people were not able to control the use of their data in this context. It recalls that the obligation to provide information constitutes a central measure for the protection of individuals, insofar as it allows the exercise of rights. It also notes that article 83(5) of the GDPR provides that failure to comply with this obligation can be sanctioned up to 20 million euros or 4% of turnover, which constitutes the ceiling of highest fine. 99. Furthermore, the restricted panel notes that the breach was only brought to an end several years after the implementation of the processing in question and only after several media outlets revealed the existence of the disputed file. 100. The restricted panel then considers that the fact for company executive have not benefited from the protection offered by the GDPR. Indeed, Article 28 of the GDPR provides various concrete guarantees in terms of data protection, by providing for example the implementation of security measures or the assistance to be provided by the subcontractor to the data controller in matters exercise of rights. 101. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that it is appropriate to impose an administrative fine with regard to the breaches of Articles 14 and 28 of the GDPR. 102. Secondly, the restricted bench recalls that under the terms of Article 83(1), the fines imposed must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. It considers in particular that the financial situation of the company must be taken into account when determining the sanction and in particular, in the event of an administrative fine, its amount. She notes in this regard that the company reports a turnover for the year 2018 of around 12 billion euros. Furthermore, it observes that the processing in question was implemented in particular with the objective of defending the economic interests of the company. In view of these elements, the restricted panel considers that the imposition of a fine of 400,000 euros appears justified. 103. Finally, the restricted panel considers that the publicity of the sanction is justified in view of the nature of the breaches noted, their duration and their seriousness. It also considers that this measure will make it possible to inform the persons concerned of the breaches sanctioned, in particular to the extent that these facts have been the subject of several complaints. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: • impose an administrative fine against company X in the amount of 400,000 (four hundred thousand) euros; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. President Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be the subject of an appeal before the Council of State within four months of its notification."

Facts and procedure 1. The Société nouvelle de l'Anuaire Français (hereinafter ""the company"" or the ""SNAF"") is a simplified joint-stock company with a share capital of 5,000 euros, located at 87 rue des Pyrénées in Paris (75020). It has an advertising management activity and manages the annuairefrancais.fr website. Its president is its sole employee. In 2018, it achieved a turnover of approximately \[…\], for a net profit of approximately \[…\]. In 2019, the company's turnover amounted to \[…\] with a net profit \[…\]. 2. The annuairefrancais.fr website is a professional directory listing French companies and which draws up, for each of them, a presentation sheet containing its main administrative information, in particular the name and address of its manager. These data come exclusively from the SIRENE public database published by INSEE on its website. About once a month, the manager of the company manually downloads the file made available by INSEE and compares the new list with the one previously published on the company’s website to update its database. Company managers can create an account on the site to access a personal space allowing them to subscribe to the company's commercial offers offering a personalized presentation of their company. 3. The National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms (hereinafter ""the CNIL"" or ""the Commission"") received, between March 1, 2018 and May 16, 2019, sixteen complaints (n ° 18011796, 18013215 , 18015831, 18016541, 18019128, 18020503, 18020676, 18022147, 18024212, 18024300, 19000390, 19001882, 19003400, 19004724, 19008218 and 19014490) concerning the website annuairefrancais.fr, relating to the difficulties encountered during requests for erasure and rectification personal data. 4. A control mission was then carried out by the CNIL with the company, in application of the decision n ° 2019-133C of June 26, 2019 of the President of the Commission. 5. The main purpose of this mission was to verify compliance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on data protection (hereinafter ""the GDPR"" or ""the Regulation"" ) and of the amended law n ° 78-17 of 6 January 1978 relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter ""the amended law of 6 January"" or ""the Data Protection Act"") of the processing implemented by this body or on its behalf. 6. The president of the company was summoned by a letter of July 17, 2019, received on July 20, 2019, to a hearing, in application of article 19-III of the aforementioned law, which was held on September 5. 2019. In addition, an online check was carried out on September 3, 2019. The report of the online check was notified to the company by letter of September 9, 2019. 7. At the end of the audit by hearing, the company was asked to communicate to the CNIL, within eight days, all the exchanges between the complainants at the origin of the control procedure and the company. , as well as a copy of an example of response to a request for erasure, a count of the number of individual companies present in the ""PROFESSIONAL 3"" table of the company database, a copy of any contractual document framing the commercial relationship with \[…\] and a copy of any contractual document framing the commercial relationship \[…\]. The minutes of the hearing were notified to the company by post on September 9, 2019. 8. As the company did not produce the requested information within the time limit set at the end of its hearing, a follow-up email was sent to it by the CNIL services on September 23, 2019, granting it an additional period of eight days to bring the requested items. 9. On October 4, 2019, the company only partially responded to the CNIL's requests by providing only the documents framing its commercial relationship with \[…\]. In addition, the company questioned the CNIL about the legality of the dissemination of data collected by INSEE and the personal nature of the data processed. She also highlighted a conflict between her and \[…\]. Finally, she said ""having excluded specific requests"" transmitted by the CNIL without specifying the subject of these requests and without providing supporting documents. 10. Numerous exchanges then took place between the company and the Commission services, without the company responding effectively to the requests made following the audit. The CNIL thus sent a follow-up on October 7, 2019 specifying in particular that the documents concerning \[...\] were only hypertext links. In response, the company sent an email the same day in which it indicated that it was going to respond to the CNIL's requests, which it did not do, however, which led the CNIL to proceed with a new relaunch. on October 10, 2019. The company provided answers on October 15 and 16, 2019 in connection with the handling of complaints and the contracts requested, but without providing the requested supporting documents. 11. On 16 October 2019, the Commission services sent a letter stating that the company had not provided any supporting documents concerning the exchanges between the complainants and the company. 12. By decision n ° MED 2020-017 of July 21, 2020, notified on July 21, 2020 and received on July 23, 2020, the President of the Commission gave formal notice to SNAF, within two months, to: ""- inform the persons concerned, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 12, 13 and 14 of the Regulation, regarding the processing of personal data in place, and in particular provide complete information to the persons, and this, in a document or medium separate from the general conditions of use of the site in order to ensure that it is easily accessible by also providing specific information to entrepreneurs whose data has been collected from the INSEE databases; - rectify the data of the complainant concerned and set up a procedure to effectively take into account any request to exercise the right of rectification and updating made by persons whose personal data appears in the database company data; - proceed with the deletion of the data of the complainants concerned (\[…\]) and put in place a procedure allowing to effectively take into account any request to exercise the right of erasure of the persons whose personal data appear in the database. company data; - implement a register of processing activities; - transmit the elements requested at the end of the minutes n ° 2019-133 / 2 not yet communicated; - justify to the CNIL that all of the aforementioned requests have been complied with, and this within the allotted time. "" 13. It was stated in the formal notice that if, at the end of the two-month period, the company had complied with the formal notice, the procedure would be closed and a letter would be sent to the company to this effect. . Conversely, if the company did not comply with the formal notice, a rapporteur would be appointed by the President of the Commission, who could ask the restricted committee to pronounce against the company one of the measures provided for in article 20 of the amended law of 6 January 1978. 14. The formal notice having remained unanswered, a reminder letter was sent by the President of the CNIL on November 19, 2020, granting the company an additional 15 days to respond to the formal notice. 15. On December 17, 2020, the company sent an email to the CNIL services in which it indicated that it had handled all of the complainants' requests individually, without providing any supporting documents. She then explained that she did not have the means to ""automatically manage deletion requests"". 16. On March 6, 2021, the company sent a new email to the CNIL services in which it established a list of the files corresponding to the various referrals received by the CNIL and in which it indicated the treatment granted to each of them and their actual status. This response did not include any supporting documents. 17. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission appointed, on April 12, 2021, Ms. Sophie LAMBREMON as rapporteur, in accordance with Article 39 of Decree No. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019. 18. At the end of her investigation, the rapporteur had a bailiff served on the Société nouvelle de l'Anuaire français, on May 27, 2021, with a report detailing the breaches of the GDPR that she considered to be in the present case. . The report notification letter specified to the company that the file was registered for the restricted training session on July 8, 2021. 19. This report proposed to the restricted formation of the Commission to pronounce an administrative fine. 20. On June 2, 2021, the company sent an email to the CNIL services. She supplemented her email with comments of July 6, 2021. 21. The company and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the session of the restricted formation. II. Reasons for the decision A. On the concept of personal data 22. Article 4.1 of the GDPR defines ""personal data"" as ""any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person"". 23. The company expressed doubts as to the personal nature of the data processed and therefore as to the competence of the Commission. According to the company, the data it publishes in its directory is not subject to Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the grounds that they are not personal data but data relating to enterprises. 24. The rapporteur considers that the information on these pages contains data which has the character of ""personal data"" within the meaning of the GDPR as long as it allows a direct identification of a natural person. 25. The restricted committee notes that the files relating to the companies referenced in the directory accessible from the company's website include, in particular, the names, first names and addresses of natural persons when they have the status of self-employed. or when they exercise a liberal profession without being a member of a practice structure. Consequently, the data present on the files relate to an identified natural person and thus have the character of ""personal data"" within the meaning of the GDPR. 26. In this regard, the restricted committee observes that the CNIL has adopted this position consistently for many years. In this sense, as early as 1985, it indicated that ""are directly nominative: information relating to directors, whatever the form of the company, as well as information relating to voters within the framework of the organization of consular elections; information relating to the corporate name of the company, when it is a company in name ""(deliberation n ° 85-45 of October 15, 1985). The Council of State also affirms that personal data are data which allow a direct identification of a natural person (see in this sense the Council of State decision, 10th SSJS, December 30, 2015, n ° 376845, § 8). 27. The restricted committee therefore considers that the data processed by the Société nouvelle de l'Anuaire Français are personal data within the meaning of Article 4.1 of the Rules and that the provisions of the Rules are applicable to the processing carried out by the company. B. On the classification of the facts with regard to the general data protection regulation 1. On the failure to comply with requests for rectification of data 28. According to Article 16 of the GDPR ""the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller, as soon as possible, the rectification of personal data concerning him which is inaccurate"". 29. It emerges from the findings of the CNIL delegation that, when the company receives rectification requests from entrepreneurs whose data appears on the annuairefrancais.fr site, a comparison is made between the data in the SIRENE database and company data appearing on the company's website. It was also established that the company only allowed requests for rectification of data when a difference was noted between the file on the annuairefrancais.fr site and the SIRENE database. If the files for the site and the SIRENE database were identical, the company refused to correct the data. 30. On September 13, 2017, \[…\] (referral n ° 18020503) sent a request for rectification of its address to the Société nouvelle de l'Anuaire français. He specified that the address given on the form was that of his personal home and not his professional address. Noting that the information on his company's file was still inaccurate, \[…\] contacted the company again on January 23, 2018. He subsequently lodged a complaint with the CNIL on October 10, 2018, this data no 'still not rectified. 31. The company was put on formal notice by the President of the Commission, by decision of July 21, 2020, within two months, to correct the data of the complainant who contacted the CNIL. It was also given formal notice, within the same period, to put in place a procedure to effectively take into account any request to exercise the right of rectification and update made by persons whose personal data appear. in the company database. 32. The rapporteur notes in her sanction report that on the day of the inspection, 3 September 2019, i.e. two years after her request, the company profile of \[…\] still presented inaccurate information, the company thus ignoring its obligations under Article 16 of the GDPR. 33. The company indicates that it proceeded, on July 6, 2021, to the deletion of all data relating to \[…\]. 34. The restricted committee notes that \[…\] alerted the Société nouvelle de l'Anuaire français, in September 2017, to the inaccuracy of some of the data mentioned on its company's file published on the annuairefrancais.fr site. 35. Although the company told him, as of September 13, 2017, to take his request into account, the restricted committee noted that the complainant had, in the absence of rectification of his data, sent a reminder to the company in January 2018 , then lodged a complaint with the CNIL in October 2018. During the control carried out by the delegation in September 2019, the company had still not rectified the personal data of the complainant. In July 2020, the president of the CNIL subsequently put the company on notice to rectify, within two months, the data of \[…\]. The restricted committee noted that this request was again not followed up, the company not having provided a satisfactory response to the formal notice. In addition, the restricted committee notes that the rapporteur specifies in her sanction report of 25 May 2021 that the informal checks carried out at the time of its drafting showed that the complainant's file still included the address of his personal home, the rectification request has therefore still not been taken into account. 36. The restricted panel was notified by letter of July 6, 2021 that the company had finally granted the complainant's request. 37. The restricted committee accepts, in any event, that despite the various steps taken by the complainant and the CNIL services, the company did not comply with the expiry of the time limit set in the formal notice of the July 21, 2020. 38. Under these conditions, and in view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel considers that the company has failed in the obligation provided for in Article 16 of the Rules. 2. On the failure to comply with data erasure requests 39. According to article 17 of the GDPR ""the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller the erasure, as soon as possible, of personal data concerning him and the controller has the obligation erase such personal data as soon as possible, when one of the following grounds applies \[…\] the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21 (1) and there is no no compelling legitimate reason for the processing "". 40. In addition, Article 21 (1) provides that ""the data subject has the right to object at any time, for reasons relating to his particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning him based on the Article 6 (1) (e) or (f), including profiling based on these provisions. The controller no longer processes personal data, unless he can demonstrate that there are legitimate reasons and imperative for the processing which prevails over the interests and rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims "". Finally, Article 6 (1) (f) provides that ""the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject who require protection of personal data, in particular when the data subject is a child "". 41. The CNIL's delegation of control established that the company receives requests to exercise the right to erasure by telephone, by mail, by email and by an online form. During the control of September 5, 2019, the delegation was informed that these requests were normally processed as they were received, but that they had not been since April 2019, ""due to operational difficulties "". It was thus noted, during the audition check, in the inbox of the company's emails, the presence of 135 requests for erasure of data not read and not processed by the manager of the company. The oldest was received on May 3, 2019, more than four months before the hearing. 42. The delegation also noted, in the context of the online control of September 3, 2019 that, among the pages whose deletion had been requested from the company by the complainants who contacted the CNIL, five were still present, on the day of the control. , on the company's website and that they contained the personal data of the complainants (the pages marked with \[…\]). For three other complainants (\[…\]), if the files corresponding to their establishment had indeed been deleted, data concerning them, such as professional activity and the department in which the company is located, remained accessible in the index pages. of the site www.annuairefrancais.fr and thus always appeared when entering the name of the complainants during a search carried out on a search engine. 43. The company was ordered to proceed with the deletion of the data of the complainants concerned (\[…\]) and to put in place a procedure making it possible to effectively take into account any request to exercise the right to erase data. persons whose personal data are in the company's database. 44. The rapporteur notes in her sanction report that the company did not delete the data of all the complainants within the time limit, as the data of \[…\] is still accessible. 45. The company indicates, in a letter of July 6, 2021, that it has reinitialized its entire database and that it is now exclusively made up of data from the SIRENE directory distributed by INSEE. It specifies that the requests made by people on the previous information published on the annuairefrancais.fr site were de facto canceled because this data was deleted during this update. From now on, the company only disseminates data published each month by INSEE, and previously updated by the latter. 46. The restricted committee considers that it emerges from the aforementioned provisions of the GDPR that, when the processing has as a legal basis the legitimate interest of the controller, the latter must comply with the request for erasure made by the data subject. when the latter has objected to the processing of his personal data and the data controller does not demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing. 47. The restricted committee notes that on the day of the findings, in eight of the sixteen complaints referred to in this procedure, the company did not provide an effective response to the requests made and the personal data in question remained directly accessible. in the company files posted on the website. 48. In addition, the restricted committee notes that the data controller does not invoke any compelling legitimate reason justifying that the processing he implements would take precedence over the rights of the complainants, while the data subjects have expressed their opposition to the processing and that they have made a request for the erasure of their personal data. 49. The restricted committee also considers that the measures that the company announces that it has recently put in place in connection with the updating of its database, which, according to the latter, would allow it to satisfy requests for the exercise of rights, are not not sufficient to ensure that these requests are taken into account, since the data of three complainants are still accessible on the site despite the update carried out. 50. The restricted committee accepts, in any event, that the company did not comply with the expiry of the deadline set in the formal notice of July 21, 2020. 51. In these circumstances, the restricted panel considers that the company has failed in the obligation provided for in Article 17 of the Rules. 3. On the breach of the obligation to implement a register of processing activities 52. Article 30 of the GDPR provides that ""each controller and, where applicable, the representative of the controller shall keep a register of processing activities carried out under their responsibility"". This obligation cannot be imposed on companies with less than 250 employees, ""unless the processing they carry out is likely to involve a risk for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned, if it is not occasional \[…\] "". 53. The findings of the CNIL delegation show that the company does not implement a register of processing activities. 54. The company was given formal notice on July 21, 2020 to implement a register of processing activities. However, she did not respond to this injunction as part of the formal notice. 55. The rapporteur considers in her sanction report that the company has therefore failed in its obligation under Article 30 of the GDPR. 56. The company does not produce any defense evidence on this point. 57. The restricted committee notes that although the company has a single employee in the person of its chairman, \[…\], the processing carried out by the company is not however occasional since it constitutes the heart of its activity. The company should therefore have implemented a register of its processing activities. 58. The restricted committee holds that the company did not comply with the expiry of the deadline set in the notice of July 21, 2020, or subsequently. 59. In these circumstances, the restricted panel considers that the company has breached the obligation provided for in Article 30 of the Rules. 4. On the breach of the obligation to cooperate with the services of the CNIL 60. Article 31 of the GDPR provides that ""the controller and the processor as well as, where applicable, their representatives shall cooperate with the supervisory authority, at the latter's request, in the execution of his missions"" . 61. The CNIL delegation noted that the company had not responded to all the requests it had formulated following the audit test carried out on September 5, 2019, but only to some, most of the time in such a way. unsatisfactory or incomplete. In addition, it was noted by the delegation that, in the company's email inbox, four emails from the CNIL dated November 13, 2017, January 16, 2018, January 29, 2018 and February 1, 2018, were not not open. As these letters were not read by the data controller, no response was given to them. 62. The company was therefore put on formal notice, on July 21, 2020, in particular to communicate the documents requested during the audit. The formal notice also included other injunctions aimed at bringing the processing into conformity and respecting the rights of individuals. 63. The rapporteur maintains in her sanction report that the company only partially responded to the request for communication of documents from the delegation of control, despite the numerous exchanges, and that the company did not comply with the requirements. of the formal notice within the time limit, which constitutes a breach of the obligation of cooperation provided for in Article 31 of the GDPR. 64. In defense, the data controller expressed difficulties in managing the resulting workload. However, he claims, in a letter of July 6, 2021, that he spent nearly a full month ""answering the same thing"" to the CNIL services, considering that he had brought himself into compliance with the GDPR. 65. In the first place, the restricted committee notes that the thirteen exchanges between the company and the CNIL did not lead to the communication of all the documents requested during the hearing of September 5, 2019 (documents mentioned above in paragraph 7). However, multiple reminders were sent to the company in September and October 2019 by the services of the CNIL, without success, and the last letter sent by the CNIL by an email of November 8, 2019 remained unanswered. At the end of these numerous exchanges, on all the requests formulated by the CNIL, the company communicated only the specific rental conditions of \[…\], the conditions of use of \[…\], an indication - without proof - of the status on the French directory site of the files corresponding to the sixteen referrals received by the CNIL and a screenshot of the download page of the SIRENE databases of companies on the data.gouv.fr site. Thus, no response was given on the exchanges between the complainants and the company, the communication of a copy of a response to a request for deletion of a file and the count of the number of individual companies present in the ""PROFESSIONAL 3"" table of the company database. 66. Second, the restricted panel notes that, despite the various discussions and reminders in the context of the formal notice, no satisfactory response has been given to the five injunctions issued in this context. 67. In these circumstances, the restricted panel considers that the company has breached the obligation provided for in Article 31 of the Rules. III. On corrective measures and publication of the sanction deliberation 68. Under the terms of III of article 20 of the amended law of 6 January 1978: ""When the data controller or his subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or from this law, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms may also , if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, if necessary in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted committee for the pronouncement, after contradictory procedure, one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 7 ° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the worldwide annual turnover total for the previous financial year, whichever is higher. In the hypotheses mentioned in 5 and 6 of article 83 of regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are raised, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted committee takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83 "". 69. Article 83 of the GDPR further provides that ""each supervisory authority shall ensure that the administrative fines imposed \[…\] are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive"", before specifying the elements to be taken into account. account in deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the amount of this fine. 70. On the imposition of a fine and its amount, the restricted committee considers that, in the present case, the aforementioned breaches justify the pronouncement of an administrative fine against the company. 71. Regarding the fine proposed by the rapporteur, the company argues in defense that its amount is excessive, given its financial capacity. 72. The Restricted Panel analyzes the criteria set out in Article 83 as follows. 73. First of all, the restricted training notes the number of breaches and the fact that they constitute breaches affecting the rights of individuals and the fundamental principles of the protection of personal data, as well as the obligation cooperation with the CNIL. 74. Next, the restricted committee considers that these breaches had direct consequences for the persons concerned, since sixteen complaints are at the origin of the procedure. In addition, if the difficulties encountered in the exercise of their rights led sixteen people to lodge complaints with the CNIL, the CNIL also noted that one hundred and thirty-five requests for the exercise of rights had not been processed by the company. on the day of the inspection. 75. The limited training also underlines the particularly long period during which the company was supported by the services of the CNIL, which sent it numerous requests within the framework of the control procedure, as well as a formal notice in view. to achieve compliance. Despite particularly long and meticulous support by the Commission services, the company has not taken measures to enable it to be in full compliance with the provisions of the GDPR. Above all, the company has not cooperated satisfactorily with the Commission services and this behavior appears to be deliberate. 76. Finally, the restricted committee observes that if the company ended up taking certain measures with a view to bringing it into conformity with the GDPR, these only came late, and only within the framework of the sanction procedure. In addition, the restricted panel notes that the company does not meet the demands of all the plaintiffs, nor all the injunctions of the formal notice. 77. All of these breaches and their seriousness justify a fine. 78. Regarding the amount of the administrative fine, the restricted panel noted that in 2018 the company's turnover amounted to \[…\], with a net accounting result of \[…\]. In 2019, the company's turnover amounted to \[…\] with a net profit \[…\]. 79. Therefore, having regard to the relevant criteria of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the GDPR mentioned above, the restricted committee considers that the imposition of a fine of 3,000 euros appears effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the requirements of Article 83 (1) of the GDPR, with regard to the size of the company and its financial situation. 80. Regarding the publicity of the decision, the restricted panel considers that the seriousness of certain breaches in itself justifies the publication of this decision. 81. The restricted committee also recalls that the breaches have given rise to several complaints received by the CNIL and that the breaches in connection with the exercise of human rights are serious. It considers that the publication of its decision makes it possible to inform people of the existence of the breaches committed by the company. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: - pronounce an administrative fine on the Société nouvelle de l'Anuaire Français in the amount of three thousand (3,000) euros, in view of the breaches established in Articles 16, 17, 30 and 31 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016; - make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the company by name after the expiration of a period of two years from its publication. President Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be appealed against to the Council of State within two months of its notification."

Facts and procedure 1. RATP, whose head office is located at 54 quai de la Rapée in Paris (75012), is a public industrial and commercial establishment created by the law of March 21, 1948. RATP is the parent entity of the RATP group. , which employed around 65,000 people in 2019. In 2020, its turnover was \[…\] euros and its net income was \[…\] euros. 2. Operations related to the RATP bus network are managed by the BUS department, within the RATP transport and maintenance operations department. The BUS department has around 16,000 machinist-receivers (who are the bus drivers), divided into sixteen operational units, each of which covers several bus lines. The social management and innovation department (GIS) is in charge of the group's human resources. 3. On May 13, 2020, the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms (hereinafter the ""CNIL"" or the ""Commission"") received a complaint from the CGT-RATP trade union organization (referral no. 20009228) relating to an assessment file for RATP agents, compiled as part of the career advancement procedure for agents in the Bords de Marne bus center. The trade union organization argued that the file in question contained a number of categories of personal data which would make it unlawful and even discriminatory. This complaint was supplemented by a letter dated June 5, 2020, relating to a similar file concerning the agents of the Quais de Seine bus center. 4. On May 18, 2020, RATP notified the Commission of a personal data breach. This notification was supplemented by an additional notification dated June 4, 2020, which developed in particular the description of the violation and the circumstances of its discovery. By these notifications, the RATP reported a violation which would have consisted in the use of a file contrary to the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (hereinafter the "" RGPD ""or the"" Rules "") within the framework of the commissions for classification of agents of the BUS department (joint commissions composed of representatives of trade unions and management, aiming to establish which agents benefit from a promotion), resulting in the loss of confidentiality of personal data. This violation would have lasted from April 9 to May 11, 2020. The RATP also qualified the files in question as contrary to RATP's policy and operating rules. The notifications were supplemented by information provided by the RATP by emails to the CNIL dated June 11 and August 5, 2020. This information related to the number of bus centers affected by the violation and, consequently, to the number of persons concerned. 5. Pursuant to decision n ° 2020-101C of 23 June 2020 of the President of the CNIL, a documentary control mission was carried out with the RATP, in order to verify that the latter complies with the all the provisions of the RGPD and of the amended law n ° 78-17 of January 6, 1978 relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter the ""law of January 6, 1978 amended""). More specifically, this involved following up on referral no. 20009228 relating to the advancement procedure and the implementation of preparatory files for classification committees held in bus centers. This mission was carried out by sending a questionnaire, sent by registered letter of June 26, 2020, to which the RATP responded by letter of July 9, 2020. 6. Pursuant to the same decision, a Commission delegation carried out on 21 July 2020 an on-site inspection mission in three bus centers: the Bords de Marne bus center, that of Aubervilliers and that of Vitry. -on the Seine. These three missions focused on the organization and preparation of the advancement procedure for bus drivers and on the distribution of skills in connection with human resources management between the RATP headquarters and the bus centers. By email dated July 31, 2020, RATP provided the additional information requested by the delegation during on-site inspections. 7. In response to additional requests from the control delegation sent by email on August 11 and September 23, 2020, RATP provided additional information by email on August 31, October 6 and November 2, 2020. These elements related in particular to the various processing of personal data showing days of strikes per employee, on the retention period policy for personal data processed by RATP as well as on the DORA application, which is a tool for viewing and extracting data. data from five computer applications for the processing and management of human resources in the BUS department (particularly for the purpose of ""exploring operational data"" and relating to operating data, quality of service and data relating to human and economic resources). 8. During these checks, the RATP informed the CNIL delegation that classification committees are held annually at the level of each operational unit. In view of these commissions, the management of the operational units makes proposals concerning the agents who should, in their opinion, benefit from a promotion. These proposals are debated during the said committees. At the end of these commissions, a list of the agents benefiting from the promotion is published by the management of the department. 9. With regard to the organization and preparation of classification committees, the delegation was informed that the social management and innovation department is drawing up a list of so-called ""nominative"" agents (agents eligible for promotion, depending on of the date of seniority in their grade) and forwards this list to the bus centers. A preparatory meeting is then organized in each operational unit, upstream of the committees, which allows managers to carry out arbitration and during which a list of agents proposed for advancement is drawn up. The management of the bus center, human resources managers and line team managers (managers, in charge of a team of bus drivers) participate in this arbitration meeting. In preparation for this meeting, a decision support file is created by the staff assigned to the human resources departments of the operational units, at the request of the management of the bus centers. The RATP indicated that these were files in Excel format listing objective data specific to the profession exercised, such as the number of days of driving, for example. These data are in principle those listed in the corresponding sheet of the register kept in application of the provisions of Article 30 of the GDPR. The advancement proposals established during the arbitration meeting are sent to the members of the classification commission before the commission is held, but not the preparatory files. 10. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission appointed, on February 12, 2021, Mrs. Albane GAILLOT as rapporteur, on the basis of article 22 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended. 11. At the end of her investigation, the rapporteur notified the RATP, on 12 May 2021, of a report detailing the breaches of the provisions of the GDPR that she considered to be in the present case. This report proposed to the restricted formation of the Commission to pronounce an administrative fine against the RATP and that this decision be made public but no longer allow the public establishment to be identified by name after the expiration of a period of two years from its publication. 12. Also attached to the report was a notice to attend the restricted training session on July 1, 2021, indicating to RATP that it had one month to communicate its written observations in application of the provisions of article 40. of decree n ° 2019-536 of May 29, 2019. 13. The RATP responded to the sanction report with written observations dated 11 June 2021. 14. On June 22, 2021, the RATP made a request that the session before the restricted panel be held in camera. By letter of June 24, 2021, the president of the restricted party rejected this request. 15. The RATP and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the restricted formation session. III. Reasons for the decision A. On the status of RATP data controller and the accountability of the processing operations in question 16. The data controller is defined, under article 4, point 7 of the GDPR, as ""the natural or legal person, public authority, service or other body which, alone or jointly with others , determines the purposes and means of processing "". 17. The rapporteur considers that RATP is responsible for the processing operations in question, within the meaning of Article 4.7 of the GDPR, in particular to the extent that it determines the purposes and means of processing relating to classification commissions. The rapporteur also notes that the RATP made the notifications of data breaches as data controller. Finally, the rapporteur considers that the breaches in question are attributable to her in that they do not stem from an isolated incident but from a practice observed in at least six operational units and in that the RATP did not bring into question implementation of sufficient means to prevent these breaches. 18. In defense, RATP does not dispute its status as data controller. However, it specifies that while it determines the purposes of processing related to classification commissions, each department determines the organizational arrangements. RATP also stresses that this is not a generalized practice. In addition, it avails itself of having implemented sufficient means to prevent the occurrence of facts such as those which are the subject of this procedure, and highlights several actions carried out, such as the training of agents, designation of ""GDPR referents / correspondents"", the documentation made available. 19. First, with regard to the responsibility for processing, the Restricted Committee considers that RATP is the entity which determines the purposes and means of processing relating to the preparation of classification committees and, therefore, is responsible for the processing. treatments involved. Indeed, the restricted committee notes that the central services of the RATP determine the general rules relating to the holding of classification committees and advancement and, thus, the purposes of processing relating to the preparation of classification committees, which do not are not specific to the different departments that carry them out but are common to RATP. It can be noted in this regard that this processing results in part from the collective agreements negotiated between the trade unions and the RATP. It also provides its various departments with the means that allow them to carry out processing relating to classification commissions, such as the DORA application. The restricted committee also underlines that the RATP proceeded to the notification of the data breach in its own name, without attributing the responsibility for the processing operations implicated in this notification to another entity and that it indicated in this notification to have acted to end the violation. In addition, it notes that the RATP data protection officer, attached to the services of the RATP general management, responded to requests from the CNIL services, as a representative of the public establishment and not of different departments in particular. 20. Second, the restricted panel considers that the breaches, the existence of which is being examined in the context of this procedure, are attributable to the RATP. In that regard, it observes, admittedly, that RATP argues that the acts identified do not comply with its operating rules. However, first of all, the panel notes that the files in question do not relate to an isolated incident in a bus center. On the contrary, the control delegation was able to observe that this practice was established not only in the Bords de Marne bus center, targeted by a complaint, but also in the Aubervilliers and Vitry-sur-Seine bus centers, which had not been the subject of a report before their control by the delegation. 21. Next, the restricted committee considers that it is up to the data controller to ensure the implementation of the regulations relating to data protection within his services, in particular by the establishment of adequate procedures and staff training. In this case, the RATP is criticized for not having implemented sufficient means to prevent such breaches of the protection of the personal data of its agents in the context of processing relating to classification commissions. B. On the breach relating to the obligation to ensure the adequacy, relevance and non-excessive nature of personal data processed in application of Articles 5.1.c and 5.2 of the GDPR 22. Article 5, paragraph 1, c) of the GDPR provides that personal data must be ""adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed (data minimization)"". 23. Article 5 (2) of the GDPR provides: ""The controller is responsible for complying with paragraph 1 and is able to demonstrate that it is complied with (liability)"". 24. The rapporteur notes that, in the context of the investigation, the CNIL control delegation noted that the register sheet relating to the preparation of the classification commissions, drawn up in May 2018, provides for the categories of data personnel which are considered necessary for processing and which may therefore appear in the preparatory files for commissions according to the RATP. These data categories are as follows: ""the name, first name of the agent, name of the team manager"", ""the registration number, date of hiring, date of qualification"", ""the old level with date, the level proposed, any bonuses "","" the date of the appraisal and progress interviews, if applicable of the progress plans "","" the professional evaluation criteria "","" the presence at work "","" the unavailability (without distinction between the reasons) "","" accidentology "","" any customer complaints, information reports, penalties "". The human resources manager of the BUS department also reminded all the human resources manager staff of the bus centers, in an email sent on May 5, 2020, that the categories of personal data that may be contained in these files preparatory work were exhaustively listed in the corresponding register file and that the files could not contain other data. 25. The rapporteur also notes that it has been observed that the practice of preparing classification committees in the controlled bus centers consisted of including in the preparatory files, in addition to the number of days of absence during the years assessed, data relating to the reasons for the unavailability of agents, including, in particular, the number of days of strike action per agent during the period assessed (ie three years). 26. In view of these findings, the rapporteur considers that the purpose of the processing constituted by the preparation of the classification committees is the evaluation of staff with a view to taking decisions relating to their promotion and that the processing for this purpose of data relating to the number of days of strike action per employee appears excessive, in that they do not constitute adequate, relevant and necessary data to achieve this purpose. 27. In addition, the rapporteur notes that the RATP informed the delegation that, in order to put an end to the data breach notified to the CNIL on May 18, 2020 and before the delegation's checks, it brought all of the data into compliance. preparatory files established for the 2019 and 2020 classification committees in each of the bus centers with the corresponding record of the BUS department processing activity register. The rapporteur notes that the findings do not confirm this assertion insofar as the breach continued on the date of the on-the-spot checks in at least two bus centers (Bords de Marne and Vitry-sur-Seine). 28. In defense, the RATP does not dispute the creation of files containing data relating to the number of days of strikes by agents but stresses that this practice is contrary to its internal rules, that this only concerns a few operational units and that the duration such a practice cannot be established. As for the persistence of the non-compliance with the on-site inspections, the RATP maintains that it is a technical error due to the poor mastery of the Excel tool and provides statements from the directors of the operational units concerned attesting that they were unaware of the existence of these tabs, which therefore could not, a fortiori, be used. 29. In the first place, with regard to the relevance of the processing of data relating to the number of days of strike action, the restricted committee notes first of all that the RATP argued, in particular during the inspections, that the rules in career development and advancement were determined by collective agreements negotiated with trade unions. These agreements do not provide for automatic advancement but take into account the assessment of individual performance. The RATP has specified the categories of data that may appear in the preparatory files for the classification committees and, among these, are the data relating to ""presence at work"" and ""unavailability (without distinction between the reasons)"". The restricted committee notes that these criteria are reflected in particular, in the preparatory files in question, by columns relating to the number of working days, the ""driving"" time, the number of days of rest and the number of days of absence. . With regard to this last column, it is not provided by the applicable rules for it to contain the reason for absences. 30. The restricted training thus notes that the number of days of absence, as well as, for example, the number of working days and the number of days of rest, is a datum which can be taken into account in the context of collective agreements. 31. It notes that the collective agreements provide that certain absences, such as absence linked to maternity leave, must appear separately so that this data is not taken into account unfavorably in the evaluation of the performance of the employee. agent concerned. On the other hand, apart from these exceptions defined in the agreements, it does not emerge from this set of rules that the reasons for the absence of employees can be taken into account for their evaluation. 32. Consequently, if the restricted committee does not call into question the relevance of the treatment of the number of days of absence with regard to the rules set, in particular by collective agreements, it considers that it is not relevant, in view of in the evaluation of agents, to treat data relating to the number of days of strike action as a separate category from the total number of days of absence. Indeed, knowing the reason for the absence is not necessary. The restricted training also notes that the dedicated file of the processing register specifies that, among the categories of data envisaged as being able to appear in these files, appear only ""unavailability (without distinction between the reasons)"". Therefore, it appears excessive and contrary to the principle of minimization to individualize the category of the number of days of strike among the absences recorded and thus to process this data for these purposes. 33. The RATP did not deny the illegal nature of the files produced in certain bus centers as part of the preparation of the classification commissions and argued that such a practice was contrary to its general policy. 34. The restricted committee considers that, insofar as the files in question constitute decision support files, they can only be composed of the personal data necessary for making decisions relating to the assessment, which have been determined beforehand. 35. The restricted committee finally underlines the specificity of the data relating to the exercise of the right to strike by an agent and notes that the processing of this personal data is not neutral. Indeed, the processing of this particular category of data by an employer must be limited to certain legitimate purposes and must fit into the legal framework resulting in particular from Article L. 1324-7 of the Transport Code and the article R. 3243-4 of the labor code. 36. Secondly, with regard to the number of people affected by this processing, the restricted committee notes that the RATP reported, through the data breach notifications as well as the subsequent emails sent to the CNIL on June 11 and 5 August 2020, the existence of files containing data relating to strike days in four operational units (Bords de Marne, Quai de Seine, Paris Sud-Ouest and Rives-Nord). CNIL checks in two other operational units, selected at random, also revealed the existence of these progress files. Six operational units out of the existing sixteen are therefore concerned, the others not having been the subject of controls. The restricted training therefore notes that these are not isolated facts. 37. Thirdly, with regard to the persistence of the practice in question, the restricted committee notes that the RATP argued during the check that, following its discovery of the file at the Bords de Marne bus center, on May 11 and 12, 2020, it analyzed all the preparatory files established for the classification committees for the years 2019 and 2020 in each of the bus centers and brought all of these files into conformity with the file. correspondent in the register of processing activities of the BUS department. The restricted committee underlines that it was however noted, during the checks in the bus centers of the edges of Marne and Vitry-sur-Seine, that the files relating to the year 2020, presented by the RATP as purged of any data not necessary, contained tabs in which were the details of the unavailability of agents and in particular data relating to days of strike action. 38. In this regard, if, in order to justify that this failure continued, the RATP argued that it was a technical error and provided statements from the directors of the operational units concerned attesting that they were unaware of the existence of these ""hidden"" tabs, which could not therefore be used, the restricted committee considers that the RATP cannot take advantage of its repeated poor mastery of the Excel tool to justify the presence of certain data in the files in question. In addition, even in the event that the directors of the operational units concerned have ignored the presence of the tabs in question in the files concerned, this does not call into question the materiality of the breach observed. 39. Lastly, the restricted committee recalls that the obligation to process only adequate, relevant and necessary data implies not only that of defining the data that must be processed but also of putting in place the relevant measures, particularly organizational ones. to ensure that only these data necessary for the purposes are actually processed. However, the Restricted Committee observes that this was not the case in the present case, as evidenced by the occurrence of the facts in question. 40. Indeed, it must be noted that, although contrary to the general policy of the RATP, the practice in question does not constitute an isolated act, which only concerned a small group of agents. On the contrary, first of all, this practice results in particular from the lack of rigor in the supervision of the organization of advancement procedures as well as of the tools made available to the various departments in this context. In this regard, in particular, the configuration of the DORA tool, which only allows the extraction of all the data relating to an agent or even to all the agents of a bus center, without it either possible to sort between the categories of data to be selected in order to extract them, was likely to contribute to the constitution of classification commission files containing inadequate data with regard to the purpose pursued. In addition, the restricted committee noted that certain organizational measures, such as the one mentioned by RATP during the procedure in order to prevent such practices from recurring - consisting in the creation of a common Excel tool which must be used to the data extractions in DORA (and other relevant applications) carried out for the constitution of the preparatory files, in order to freeze what a preparatory table can contain in terms of data - now make it possible to prevent the emergence of such practices, and could usefully have been implemented before the initiation of this proceeding. 41. In view of all of the foregoing, the restricted training considers that it was the responsibility of RATP, as data controller, to ensure that only the categories of personal data necessary for the making of decisions relating to the evaluation to constitute the files in question, in accordance with articles 5.1.c and 5.2 of the GDPR. Consequently, the RATP failed to fulfill its obligations by including in these files data relating to the number of days of strike per employee during the period assessed and by refraining from ensuring that the purge decided following the discovery of the offending files is actually implemented. 42. The Restricted Panel therefore considers that these facts constitute a breach of Articles 5, paragraph 1, e), and 5, paragraph 2, of the GDPR. C. The breach of the obligation to define and respect a retention period for personal data proportionate to the purpose of the processing pursuant to Article 5.1.e of the GDPR 43. Under the terms of Article 5.1.e of the Regulation, personal data must be ""kept in a form allowing the identification of the persons concerned for a period not exceeding that necessary for the purposes for which they are intended. processed; personal data may be kept for longer periods as long as they will be processed exclusively for archival purposes in the public interest, for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes in accordance with the Article 89 (1), provided that the appropriate technical and organizational measures required by this Regulation are implemented in order to guarantee the rights and freedoms of the data subject (limitation of retention) "". 1. Regarding the retention periods of data accessible in the DORA application 44. The rapporteur notes that the delegation has been informed that the DORA application is a tool for viewing and extracting data from five IT applications, which are implemented for the processing and management of human resources of the BUS department. The RATP indicated that the purpose of this application is in particular ""the exploration of operational data"" (operating data, quality of service, data relating to human and economic resources). As a visualization tool, it does not allow users to modify data in searchable information systems, but allows them to extract it to Excel files. 45. The rapporteur also notes that the delegation was informed that the personal data contained in DORA are kept, on an active basis, for the duration of the agent's employment in the BUS department, extended by six years. The rapporteur emphasizes that RATP has not been able to justify this data retention period with regard to the purposes for which they are processed and considers that this retention period in the active database in the DORA tool is therefore excessive. . 46. In defense, the RATP argues that the retention period which had been indicated to the control delegation, namely the length of the agent's employment in the BUS department, extended by six years, was incorrect and that this duration corresponded to the retention period of data in the archive database and not in the active database. In its writings, the RATP explains that the retention period in the active database was in fact six years on the date of the checks carried out by the CNIL. It further specifies that this period was considered excessive during internal work and that it was reduced to two years, plus the current year, after the checks carried out by the delegation. 47. The restricted committee first of all takes note of the details provided by the RATP during the procedure and in particular of the fact that the data were kept in an active database in DORA for six years and not during the length of the employment of six years. 48. The restricted committee recalls that the retention period of personal data must be determined according to the purpose pursued by the processing. When this purpose is achieved, the data must in principle be deleted, anonymized or be subject to intermediate archiving when their retention is necessary for compliance with legal obligations or for pre-litigation or litigation purposes. 49. In this case, the DORA application is a data visualization tool for the purposes of human resources management of the BUS department, the purpose of which is ""exploration of operational data"". It should allow, among other things, a monitoring of agent activity. The restricted training noted that this purpose, as identified by the RATP, is very broad and imprecise, and that it does not allow for a precise understanding of the operational needs that result from it. In addition, nothing in the file makes it possible to determine what purposes would justify the agents authorized to access DORA to be able, in order to achieve them, to view all of this data relating to human resources over a period of six years. For example, this information includes data relating to the number of days of strike action per employee, which are used in particular to calculate the basis of pay as well as social security contributions and contributions. The RATP does not establish why this information should be kept in the DORA application, once the payslip is established, for a period of six years, while a much shorter period on an active basis would be sufficient for the establishment of the payroll. Other purposes, such as viewing information for monitoring agent activity, may justify a longer period, but the need to go back to the previous six years has not been established. 50. The Restricted Committee further notes that, far from being able to justify the retention period of all the data in the DORA application with regard to the purposes of this tool, the RATP on the contrary argued that the the retention period in the active database of the DORA application, at the date of the checks, was considered excessive in view of the exploration purposes of this application. This period was, during the procedure, reduced to two years plus the current year, to allow managers to monitor the activity of agents over a reduced period but sufficiently significant to see changes. 51. Consequently, the restricted committee considers that the retention of the personal data in question for six years on an active basis, without a differentiated and adapted approach to data retention with regard to the precise purposes for which they are processed. implemented, did not allow compliance with the principle of limiting the retention period of data. 52. In view of all these elements, the restricted committee considers that the breach of Article 5, paragraph 1, e) of the GDPR is characterized. 2. Regarding the retention period of the classification committee preparation files 53. The rapporteur notes that the delegation was informed that the expected retention period of the files for the preparation of the classification commissions was eighteen months, from the date of the classification commission for which they were established. This duration is provided for on the corresponding register sheet, depending on the purpose of this processing (decision-making aid for the assessment of agents). However, the delegation noted that, in the Aubervilliers and Vitry-sur-Seine bus centers, the 2017 classification committee preparation files were present on the servers. 54. In view of these findings, the rapporteur criticizes RATP for keeping the files in question for a period that exceeds that necessary with regard to the purpose of the processing and for not effectively implementing its policy of conservation. 55. In defense, the RATP emphasizes the isolated nature of the facts. 56. The restricted committee notes that the committee preparation files are established as a decision-making support for preparatory meetings for the annual classification committees, with a view to the evaluation of staff, and can therefore only be kept for the duration. necessary for the achievement of this purpose. The restricted committee observed that the RATP set their retention period at eighteen months after the classification commission for which these files are produced, having considered that this was the period necessary for the purpose of the processing. 57. However, the restricted committee notes that the CNIL delegation noted the conservation, in the Aubervilliers and Vitry-sur-Seine bus centers, of the classification committee preparation files dating from 2017, which corresponds to for a period of more than three years after the meeting of the classification committee concerned. The restricted committee considers that this retention is excessive insofar as it exceeds the time necessary to achieve the purpose pursued, which is, according to the RATP, eighteen months after the classification commission for which these files are produced. . The planned retention period for the classification commission preparation files is therefore not effectively implemented since only files relating to the 2019 and 2020 classification commissions should have been able to appear on the servers on the date of the checks. However, the effectiveness of the implementation of a data retention period policy is the necessary counterpart to its definition and makes it possible to ensure that the data are kept in a form allowing the identification of the persons concerned for a period of time. not exceeding that necessary with regard to the purposes for which they are processed. This also makes it possible, in particular, to reduce the risks of unauthorized use of the data in question, by an employee or by a third party. 58. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that RATP has failed to comply with its obligations under Article 5, paragraph 1, e) of the GDPR. D. The breach relating to the obligation to ensure the security of personal data pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR 1. On authorizations to access and extract data in DORA 59. Article 32 of the Rules provides: ""1. Taking into account the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks, the degree of probability and severity of which vary, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data controller and the processor implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee a level of security adapted to the risk, including, among others, according to the needs: \[…\] (B) the means to ensure the constant confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; \[…\] "". 60. The rapporteur notes that the delegation was informed that the DORA tool allows all authorized agents, whatever their missions, to perform the same actions and, thus, not only to view personal data. stored in the tool but also to extract all of this data. The rapporteur therefore considers that DORA's authorization policy does not make it possible to limit users' access to only the data they actually need in the context of their duties, being reminded that the DORA tool contains a large volume of data. data, particularly in connection with human resources management, and relating to all the agents of the BUS and MRB departments (bus rolling stock). 61. In defense, the RATP maintains that the system cannot be compartmentalized and that all authorized agents need to have access to all data in the course of their duties. It also argues that transversal access between operational units corresponds to an operational and organizational need and specifies in this regard that operational unit directors need to have access to the data of all operational units in order to ensure continuity of service. RATP also maintains that it is in the process of implementing an action plan aimed at partitioning the access of the ""operational unit management"" and ""HR assistant"" profiles to only the data of the operational unit to which they are attached. 62. The restricted committee recalls in this regard that in application of article 32 of the GDPR, the data controller must put in place appropriate measures to ensure the confidentiality of the data and prevent the data from being processed unlawfully by the made up of people who don't need to know. The prevention of misuse and data breaches can be partly ensured by organizational measures, in particular by informing users of the information system about the data that they are authorized to process for their missions, by controlling the use that is made of it. is done, in particular by means of connection logs, and by disciplining non-compliance with the applicable rules. In addition to these measures, the management of authorizations to consult or use an information system must tend to limit access to only the personal data that a user needs for the performance of his missions, in particular by defining profiles. empowerment in systems by separating tasks and areas of responsibility. It is therefore up to the data controller to set up, depending on the greater or lesser diversity of the users' missions, an authorization management policy that is appropriate to the importance and sensitivity of the data processed, as well as the risks to which the persons concerned are exposed, according to the means at his disposal. 63. By way of illustration, the restricted training noted that the Guide for the development of an information system security policy of the National Information Systems Security Agency (published in 2004) specifies in this regard that the definition of authorizations must respect the principle of the need to know: any actor will have exclusive access to the information he needs in the accomplishment of his task. 64. In the present case, the restricted formation notes, first of all, that all the DORA users authorized to access the ""pointing"" part of the tool have access to the data relating to all the agents of the BUS departments and MRB. On the one hand, all authorized agents therefore have access to all categories of data (all data relating to human resources and thus, in particular, data relating to days of strike or sick leave) without distinction. duties or missions of agents. On the other hand, these agents access the data relating to the agents of their operational unit but also of all the other operational units (i.e. more than 16,000 people), without the need for this access for all the agents having been established. by RATP. On the contrary, the latter explained in its written observations that it was implementing an action plan aimed at partitioning the access of certain profiles to only the data of the operational unit to which they are attached and, thus, to define a stricter authorization policy. 65. Secondly, the restricted committee considers that the configuration of the tool does not ensure the confidentiality of data within the meaning of Article 32 of the GDPR to the extent that all authorized agents can extract all of the data. data contained in the tool. Indeed, the delegation noted that the authorization policy did not make it possible to distinguish, according to the functions of the authorized agents, whether the ability to extract personal data was necessary in relation to their functions. 66. Consequently, the restricted committee considers that the authorization policy for the DORA tool does not guarantee that authorized persons have access only to the data strictly necessary for their functions. It considers that the authorization policy should be more detailed and allow the creation of more different profiles, relating to the functions of the agents or to the bus centers to which they are assigned, as the RATP is now planning to put in place, all the more so given the volume of data and the sensitivity of certain data accessible in the tool. 67. In view of all of these elements, the restricted committee considers that the level of confidentiality of the personal data contained in this tool does not comply with the requirements of Article 32 of the GDPR. 2. On the authorizations to access the preparation files of the classification committees 68. The rapporteur underlines that the delegation noted that, at the Aubervilliers bus center, the classification committee preparation files were accessible on a server to all participants in the arbitration meetings for which they were established. Thus, these preparatory files were accessible, not only to the center management and to the human resources department, who could in any case view the data contained in these files on DORA, but also to all line team managers. , who are not authorized to consult this data in DORA. The thirteen line team managers therefore had access to the personal data of all the bus drivers available for the advancement of the bus center (around 800 bus drivers are assigned to this bus center, of which only a part is ""nominable"" every year). 69. The rapporteur considers that the fact that the preparatory files for classification committees are accessible on a server by all line team managers does not guarantee the confidentiality of the data since these files contain numerous personal data of agents, and in particular of agents who are not under their responsibility. 70. In defense, the RATP maintains that all the authorized managers need, within the framework of the preparatory meeting, to have visibility on the data relating to all the bus drivers who can be offered from the same operational unit. , to be able to proceed to arbitration. It specifies that making these files available to all managers is necessary in order to ensure collegiality of decisions during the arbitration meetings in question. 71. With regard to the provisions of Article 32 of the aforementioned GDPR, the restricted committee considers that the confidentiality of the data contained in the preparatory files for the classification commissions in question in this case is not guaranteed when the files are updated. available to all line team managers, regardless of whether they are agents under their responsibility or not. Indeed, it notes first of all that while it is legitimate for line team managers to have access to the personal data of the agents under their responsibility upstream of the commissions, in order to decide on their possible progress, it does not appear proportionate for the personal data of all the bus drivers of the bus center to be available to them on a server. 72. The restricted committee then noted that the practice questioned by the rapporteur differs from that observed in the other controlled bus centers, where these files are not made available to line team managers before the meeting. arbitration, but only projected at these meetings. It notes that this practice does not call into question the collegiality of decisions and, thus, satisfies the purpose of the processing, while ensuring a higher degree of confidentiality of the data. In this regard, the restricted committee considers that the risks associated with the loss of confidentiality of the data, such as the reuse of these, are markedly less when the data in question is only projected, the time of a meeting, and not available on a server. 73. Consequently, the restricted committee considers that the practice observed in the other controlled bus centers makes it possible to consider that the risk associated with the fact that the files in question are accessible on a server to all line team managers is not is not proportionate to the desired purpose, that is to say the need, for the participants in the arbitration meetings, to have occasional knowledge of this data in order to participate in the arbitrations. 74. In view of all of these elements, the restricted panel considers that the aforementioned facts constitute a breach of Article 32 of the GDPR. IV. On corrective measures and their publicity 75. Under the terms of III of article 20 of the amended law of 6 January 1978: ""When the data controller or his subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or from this law, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms may also , if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, if necessary in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted committee for the pronouncement, after contradictory procedure, one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 7 ° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the worldwide annual turnover total for the previous financial year, whichever is higher. In the hypotheses mentioned in 5 and 6 of article 83 of regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are raised, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted committee takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83 "". 76. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that ""Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the administrative fines imposed under this article for violations of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive "", before specifying the elements to be taken into account in deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the amount of this fine. 77. First, on the principle of the imposition of an administrative fine, the RATP maintains that such a measure is not necessary. It considers in particular that account must be taken of the circumstances of the case and in particular of the measures it adopted during the proceedings. She also maintains that the majority of the decisions handed down against public establishments were not financial sanctions whereas ""the failures appeared to concern similar facts"". 78. The restricted committee recalls that it must take into account, for the imposition of an administrative fine, the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the violation, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and the categories of personal data affected by the breach. 79. The restricted committee considers first of all that the RATP has shown serious failures in terms of the protection of personal data since breaches are made in the fundamental and elementary principles of the GDPR, which are the principles of data minimization, liability, limitation of the retention period of data and security. 80. The restricted committee notes that by breaching the principle of minimization of personal data, the RATP has shown certain negligence, relating to a fundamental principle of the GDPR. In fact, data relating to the exercise of the right to strike by an agent was made accessible to people who did not have to know about it. The restricted committee notes that if, in the context of certain other processing activities, the controller could process this data, it is otherwise in the context of the assessment of agents, for which the number of days of strike per agent was not relevant. In addition, the use of this particular data, in the context of decision-making relating to the career of the agent, may be unfavorable to him. 81. Next, the restricted committee notes that, even after having been informed of the violation and after having carried out a ""social alert"" procedure in consultation with the trade unions, the RATP did not take all the necessary measures to ensure the compliance of all the bus centers since the persistence of the breach of article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was observed during the checks, although the RATP confirmed to the CNIL that it brought all the files into compliance in all bus centers. 82. In addition, with regard to the breach relating to the retention period of data, the Restricted Committee notes that the RATP declared, during the inspection, to consider that the retention period set was excessive, without however having put effectively implement measures to ensure compliance with its data retention policy. 83. The restricted training also noted that several shortcomings observed concerned a large number of people, namely around 16,000 agents from the BUS department, which led a trade union organization to appeal to the CNIL. 84. Finally, the restricted committee noted that the compliance measures adopted during the procedure do not concern all the breaches and do not, in any event, exonerate the RATP from its liability for the past. 85. Consequently, the restricted committee considers that it is appropriate to impose an administrative fine with regard to the breaches of Articles 5-1-c), 5-1-e), 5-2 and 32 of the GDPR. 86. Second, with regard to the amount of the fine, RATP highlights the measures taken to remedy all of the alleged facts referred to in the report and its commitment to pursue all of these measures. She also maintains that her financial situation, mainly due to the health crisis, should be taken into consideration. Finally, she argues that the amount proposed by the rapporteur would be disproportionate with regard to previous decisions of the CNIL. 87. The restricted panel recalls that paragraph 3 of Article 83 of the Rules provides that in the event of multiple violations, as is the case in the present case, the total amount of the fine may not exceed the amount set. for the most serious violation. Insofar as the RATP is accused of a breach of Articles 5-1-c), 5-1-e), 5-2 and 32 of the Regulations, the maximum amount of the fine that may be withheld is 20 million euros or 4% of annual worldwide turnover, whichever is greater. 88. The restricted committee also recalls that administrative fines must be dissuasive but proportionate. It considers in particular that the activity of the body and its financial situation must be taken into account in determining the penalty and in particular, in the event of an administrative fine, its amount. It notes in this regard that the RATP reports a turnover in 2020 amounting to approximately \[…\] euros for a net profit of \[…\] euros while the net profit amounted to \[…\] euros. in 2019. 89. Therefore, in view of the economic context caused by the Covid-19 health crisis, its consequences on the financial situation of RATP, its efforts to ensure compliance and the relevant criteria of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the GDPR mentioned above, the restricted committee considers that the pronouncement of an administrative fine of 400,000 euros appears justified. 90. Thirdly, with regard to the publication of the sanction, the RATP maintains that such a measure would cause it disproportionate harm and in particular argues that it would harm its strategy for relaunching its users and that it would be harmful for the relations maintained by RATP with its agents. 91. In view of the number of breaches noted, their persistence, their seriousness and the number of people concerned, the restricted committee considers that the publicity of this decision is justified. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: - pronounce against the Autonomous Paris Transport Authority an administrative fine in the amount of 400,000 (four hundred thousand) euros with regard to the breaches established in Articles 5-1-c), 5-1-c), 5-1-e), 5-2 and 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of personal data and on the free movement of such data; - make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the Autonomous Paris Transport Authority by name after a period of one year from its publication. President Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be appealed against to the Council of State within two months of its notification."

Facts and procedure 1. SLIMPAY (hereinafter the ""company"") is a public limited company, registered with the Paris Trade and Companies Register, whose business is consulting in computer systems and software. Its workforce is 83 employees. 2. The company is an authorized payment institution, which offers recurring payment services in the Single Euro Payments Area (“Single Euro Payments Area” – SEPA). It offers its customers, ""merchants"" who are legal persons, solutions for managing subscriptions and recurring payments. 3. Within the framework of the services provided by the company to its merchants, the personal data processed are those of the debtors who are natural persons of the merchants. As of September 1, 2020, SLIMPAY had \[…\] individual debtors of merchants in its databases. 4. In 2019, the company achieved a turnover of \[…\] euros and presented a net result of \[…\] euros. In 2020, its turnover amounted to \[…\] euros and it presented a net result of \[…\] euros. The company also raised funds of \[…\] euros in 2015. 5. During the summer of 2015, during an internal research project on an anti-fraud mechanism, the company reused personal data contained in its databases for the purposes of test. She thus imported debtors' personal data onto a server. When the research project ended in July 2016, the data remained stored on this server, which was not subject to any particular security procedure and which was freely accessible from the Internet. 6. On February 14, 2020, one of the company's client merchants informed him of these elements. SLIMPAY then immediately isolated the server and sequestered the data, in order to put an end to the personal data breach. 7. On February 17, 2020, the company notified the data breach to the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (hereinafter the ""Commission"" or the ""CNIL""). 8. On February 26, 2020, the company made an additional data breach notification to the CNIL, giving more details on the security incident, in particular on the measures implemented by the company, the number of people and the type of personal data affected by the data breach. 9. Debtor data from \[…\] merchants, corresponding to approximately twelve million unique debtors, were affected by this breach. The personal data concerned by the breach are civil status data (civil status, surname, first name), postal, electronic and telephone contact details, and banking information (""Bank Identifier Code"" - BIC/ ""International Bank Account Number "" - IBAN). 10. The elements transmitted by the company having made it possible to establish the cross-border nature of the processing concerned, the CNIL informed on February 27, 2020, in accordance with Article 56 of the GDPR, all the European supervisory authorities of its competence to act as lead supervisory authority and thus opened the procedure for the declaration of the authorities concerned on this case. 11. Pursuant to Decision No. 2020-107C of the President of the Commission of May 12, 2020, the CNIL carried out a document inspection mission to the company, in order to verify compliance by the latter with all the provisions of law no. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 as amended relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter the ""law of 6 January 1978 as amended"" or ""Data Protection Act"") and of the regulations (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter the ""GDPR""). This mission was carried out by sending a questionnaire to the company, sent by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt on July 31, 2020. 12. By email of August 5, 2020, the company's data protection officer requested an extension from the CNIL delegation. 13. By email of August 6, 2020, an extension was granted to the company until September 11, 2020. 14. On September 11, 2020, the company sent response elements to the CNIL, by secure electronic means. 15. By emails of October 21 and December 2, 2020, the CNIL delegation requested additional information from the company, in particular to find out whether the company had carried out a public communication or another similar action to inform people affected by the data breach and whether the research and development work they were working on as part of the fight against fraud required the use of real, non-anonymized data. These elements were transmitted respectively on October 29 and December 10, 2020. 16. For the purposes of investigating this file, the President of the Commission, on April 12, 2021, appointed Mrs Valérie PEUGEOT as rapporteur on the basis of Article 39 of Decree No. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 taken for the application of the amended law of January 6, 1978. 17. At the end of her investigation, the rapporteur, on June 23, 2021, had the company SLIMPAY notified of a report detailing the breaches of the GDPR that she considered constituted in this case. A letter was also given to him, informing him that the file was on the agenda of the restricted training of September 16, 2021. 18. This report proposed that the restricted committee of the Commission impose an administrative fine on the company, with regard to the breaches of Articles 28 paragraphs 3 and 4, 32 and 34 of the GDPR. He also proposed that the sanction decision be made public, but that it would no longer be possible to identify the company by name after the expiry of a period of two years from its publication. 19. On July 23, 2021, the company filed comments in response. 20. The company and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the meeting of September 16, 2021. II. Reasons for decision 21. According to Article 56(1) of the Regulation, ""the supervisory authority of the main establishment or of the sole establishment of the controller or of the processor is competent to act as lead control concerning the cross-border processing carried out by this controller or processor, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 60"". 22. In the present case, the Restricted Committee notes that the registered office of the company, the sole establishment of the company SLIMPAY, is located in France and that it has been registered in the trade and companies register in France since its origin, which leads to making the CNIL the competent lead supervisory authority concerning the cross-border processing carried out by this company, in accordance with Article 56 paragraph 1 of the Regulation. 23. Applying the cooperation and consistency mechanism provided for in Chapter VII of the GDPR, the CNIL informed, on February 27, 2020, all the European supervisory authorities of its competence to act as the chief supervisory authority of file concerning the cross-border processing carried out by the company, thus opening the procedure for the declaration of the authorities concerned on this case. The supervisory authorities of the following countries have declared themselves concerned by this procedure: Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands. 24. Pursuant to Article 60(3) of the GDPR, the draft decision adopted by the Restricted Committee was sent to these supervisory authorities on November 25, 2021. 25. As of 24 December 2021, none of the supervisory authorities concerned had raised a relevant and reasoned objection to this draft decision, so that, pursuant to Article 60(6) of the GDPR , the latter are deemed to have approved it. A. On the status of the company in terms of processing responsibility 26. Under Article 4 of the GDPR, the controller is defined as ""the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing"" (point 7) and processor is ""the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller"" ( item 8). 27. Article 28-10 of the GDPR provides that ""without prejudice to Articles 82, 83 and 84, if, in violation of this Regulation, a processor determines the purposes and means of the processing, it is considered as a data controller in respect of such processing"". 28. The rapporteur notes that the SLIMPAY company acts as the data controller concerned by the data breach and as a subcontractor for the processing implemented in the context of the services provided to merchants, data controllers. 29. In defence, the company does not dispute the rapporteur's analysis on this point. 30. The Restricted Committee considers that the notion of data controller must be the subject of a concrete assessment taking into account all the elements making it possible to attribute this quality to an entity. In this respect, it notes that it appears from the elements communicated to the CNIL that the company SLIMPAY acts as a subcontractor for the processing carried out within the framework of the services provided to merchants, data controllers, insofar as the company does not determine the purposes of data processing. These services constitute the bulk of its activity (recurring payment services, SEPA mandates, etc.). 31. The Restricted Committee also notes that the company itself uses, within the framework of the services provided to merchants, the services of subcontractors. As the company indicates, SLIMPAY's subcontractors are therefore second-level subcontractors vis-à-vis the merchants. 32. The Restricted Committee also considers that the company SLIMPAY acted as the controller concerned by the data breach, this being an internal research processing operation concerning an anti-fraud mechanism, for which it alone determined the ends and means. The company also indicates itself to act as data controller, in the additional data breach notification that it sent to the CNIL on February 26, 2020. 33. It is therefore up to the Restricted Committee to examine, in the light of these qualities, the grievances formulated by the rapporteur against the company. B. On the characterization of breaches with regard to the GDPR 34. As a preliminary point, the Restricted Committee notes that, in defence, the company contests the fact that breaches unrelated to the breach of personal data can be retained, whereas this is at the origin of the procedure . 35. The Restricted Committee considers that the fact that the CNIL's investigations were initially motivated by the occurrence of the data breach, following its notification, has no bearing on the possibility of finding the existence of other breaches. to the GDPR with regard to the facts observed during the investigations carried out by the CNIL's delegation of control. 36. Indeed, it follows from Article 8 of the Data Protection Act that the CNIL, on the one hand, can carry out verifications relating to all processing and, if necessary, obtain copies of all documents or media information useful for its missions, on the other hand, must ensure that the processing of personal data is implemented in accordance with the provisions of the said law and the other provisions relating to the protection of personal data provided for by legislative and regulatory texts, European Union law and France's international commitments. 37. In this context, and in application of article 20 of the Data Protection Act, the restricted committee takes measures and imposes sanctions against data controllers or subcontractors who do not comply with the obligations arising from the GDPR and said law. 1. On the breach of the obligation to regulate by a formalized legal act the processing carried out by a subsequent subcontractor 38. According to Article 28(3) of the GDPR, “Processing by a processor is governed by a contract or other legal act under Union law or the law of a Member State, which binds the processor vis-à-vis the controller, defines the object and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and the categories of data subjects, and the obligations and the rights of the data controller This contract or other legal act provides, in particular, that the processor: (a) only process personal data on documented instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or to an international organisation, unless required to do so under Union law or the law of the Member State to which the processor is subject; in this case, the processor informs the controller of this legal obligation before the processing, unless the law concerned prohibits such information for important reasons of public interest; b) ensures that the persons authorized to process the personal data undertake to respect confidentiality or are subject to an appropriate legal obligation of confidentiality; c) take all measures required under Article 32; d) complies with the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 to recruit another processor; \[…\] "". 39. Pursuant to paragraph 4 of the same article, when a processor recruits another processor to carry out specific processing activities on behalf of the controller, the same data protection obligations as those fixed in the contract between the controller and the processor are imposed on this other processor by a contract or by means of another legal act, in particular with regard to presenting sufficient guarantees as to the implementation implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures so that the processing meets the requirements of the Regulation. Where that other processor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations, the initial processor shall remain fully liable to the controller for the performance by the other processor of its obligations. 40. As part of the investigations carried out by the CNIL, the company SLIMPAY indicated that it uses \[…\] subcontractors acting under its authority as second-level subcontractors vis-à-vis the merchants, for the services that it provides to the latter (recurring payment services, SEPA mandates, etc.). The company also specified that it sends these subcontractors a ""questionnaire relating to subcontracting"" in order to comply with the GDPR. On the said questionnaire, it is indicated: ""as a payment service provider, SlimPay is determined to comply with the provisions of the regulation on the protection of personal data (regulation (EU) 2016/679). To this end, we must ensure that the data processing carried out by our partners complies with legal requirements.”. 41. The rapporteur considered that the steps taken by the company with its subcontractors through these questionnaires were not sufficient to meet its obligations and ensure that subsequent subcontractors provide the sufficient guarantees required. . It also noted that the contracts and amendments concluded with three companies did not contain all the clauses provided for in Article 28(3) of the GDPR and that those concluded with three other companies did not include any of the mandatory information provided for by that same item. 42. In defence, the company explains that it implements concrete measures to ensure its compliance with data protection regulations as part of an ongoing process, not only relying on the compliance documentation provided by its subcontractors, who offer standard contractual commitments, but also through occasional questionnaires. It specifies that the questionnaires communicated during the CNIL inspection were only intended to justify the verifications carried out by SLIMPAY with its subcontractors, adding that, for lack of the said subcontractors to provide contractual documentation framing the guarantees in with regard to data protection, it is planned to submit such an agreement to them. SLIMPAY also reports on ongoing negotiations with certain companies on the signing of amendments relating to the protection of personal data. 43. Firstly, the Restricted Committee notes that the company has not provided proof that the questionnaire referred to is completed by subsequent subcontractors. In any case, even if it were, the Restricted Committee emphasizes that the said questionnaire has only declarative value and that it does not constitute a binding legal act by which the subsequent subcontractor undertakes to respect the defined elements. Sending this questionnaire does not therefore allow the obligations set out in Article 28 paragraphs 3 and 4 to be met. 44. Secondly, the Restricted Committee notes that some of the contracts entered into by the company with its subcontractors do not contain all the clauses provided for in Article 28(3) of the GDPR. In this sense, it notes that the contracts and amendments concluded with \[…\] do not specify all the mandatory information under Article 28 of the GDPR, including in particular the type of data concerned as well as the obligations and rights of the person responsible. treatment. Similarly, in the contract and the amendments concluded with \[…\] - the type of data as well as the obligations and rights of the data controller are not mentioned. 45. The Restricted Committee also notes that the contracts and amendments entered into with the companies \[…\] do not contain any of the mandatory information provided for in Article 28 of the GDPR. 46. Thirdly, the Restricted Committee notes that the company SLIMPAY provided, in the context of the sanction procedure, an example of a ""protection of personal data"" endorsement concluded with the company \[…\] in July 2021 and that she specified that negotiations are in progress with the companies \[…\]. The Restricted Committee takes note of the partial compliance within the framework of this procedure. The fact remains that the fact that the company has taken steps with the subcontractors in the context of this procedure clearly demonstrates that it was not in compliance at the time of the investigations carried out by the CNIL. 47. Moreover, it still is not with regard to certain contracts, thus continuing to disregard the obligation to regulate by a formalized legal act the processing carried out by a subsequent subcontractor. 48. Therefore, in view of all of these elements, the Restricted Committee considers that the breach of Article 28 paragraphs 3 and 4 of the GDPR is clear. 2. On the breach of the obligation to ensure data security 49. According to Article 32 of the GDPR, “1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks , the degree of likelihood and severity of which varies, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, including including, among others, as needed: a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data; b) the means to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; c) the means to restore the availability of personal data and access to them within an appropriate period of time in the event of a physical or technical incident; d) a procedure for regularly testing, analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing. 2. When assessing the appropriate level of security, account shall be taken in particular of the risks presented by the processing, resulting in particular from the destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or unauthorized access to such data, accidentally or unlawfully \[…\]”. a) On the security defect that led to the breach of personal data - On the characterization of the breach 50. The rapporteur notes that it appears from the information communicated to the CNIL that, as part of a research project carried out in 2015, SLIMPAY reused personal data of debtors for the purposes of testing a mechanism to combat against fraud. The project ended the following year, in July 2016, but the data remained hosted on a server not subject to any particular security measures. On February 14, 2020, the company was notified by one of its customers of the possibility of freely accessing this data from the Internet by means of a URL simply composed of an IP address and a communication port, without further access restriction or security measure. The company, the same evening, isolated the server containing the personal data concerned. 51. According to the rapporteur, the company's breach of its security obligation thus began in 2015, when merchant customer data was imported onto a server not subject to any security measures, and it continued since it only ended in February 2020, after the company was alerted by one of its customers. It considers, since it is a continuous breach, that it is appropriate to sanction from the point of view of the GDPR and that such an analysis was recently confirmed by the Council of State in its decision of 1 March 2021 concerning Futura Internationale. 52. With regard to the facts constituting the breach, the rapporteur emphasizes that access to the server in question was not subject to any satisfactory access restriction measure and that the company had not put in place any logging measures. server access. 53. In defence, SLIMPAY contests the rapporteur's analysis according to which the principle of non-retroactivity of the more severe criminal sanction cannot apply to breaches which continue to produce effects over time, to the point that even started under the empire of the Data Protection Act, they persist under the aegis of the GDPR and must therefore be qualified as continuous and apprehended, for the period after the entry into force of the GDPR, by the application of the provisions of the said Regulations. To do this, it also relies on the judgment of the Council of State of March 1, 2021 relating to the company Futura Internationale, considering that this case law applies to a specific case distinct from this case: in the Futura Internationale judgment, the Council of State took care to specify that deliberate breaches had not been corrected despite formal notice from the CNIL. This case law is therefore not transposable to the case in point according to the company insofar as it was automatically offered a sanction without formal notice or prior injunction from the CNIL and that it also collaborated with diligently and in good faith with the CNIL upon notification of the incident. 54. In addition, the SLIMPAY company explains that the vulnerability of the server is the consequence of isolated human negligence and not of a deficiency in its technical and organizational system. It recalls that the general security obligation of companies must be analyzed as an obligation of means and not of result. She adds that she terminated the data breach immediately upon being notified. It also indicates that the use of data stored on the server required computer knowledge and the use of specific tools, that the data present on the server dated from 2012 to 2013 and that, consequently, they were difficult to use by a attacker. Finally, it notes that the IP address of the server was not referenced on a search engine. 55. During the Restricted Committee session, the company clarified that the human negligence referred to in its pleadings was in fact attributable \[…\]. It largely insisted on the fact that it had not committed, as data controller, any breach of its security obligations insofar as the error was made by \[…\]. 56. Firstly, with regard to the principle of non-retroactivity, the Restricted Committee considers that, insofar as the breach of personal data, as well as the lack of security in which it originated, continued after on May 25, 2018, the date of entry into force of the GDPR, it is in the light of this text that the shortcomings of which SLIMPAY is accused must be assessed. This analysis was confirmed by the Council of State in its decision of March 1, 2021 concerning Futura Internationale. In this case following a complaint relating to cold calling by the company Futura Internationale, the Conseil d'État considered that, if the company's shortcomings were noted during a control mission to which proceeded by the CNIL before the entry into application of the GDPR, they continued after this date. The Council of State concluded that ""it is thus right that the CNIL, noting the continuous nature of the breaches noted \[…\], considered the GDPR applicable to the facts of the case and assessed the breaches with regard to this one” (Council of State, 10th-9th chambers combined, March 1, 2021, Futura Internationale, n° 437808). 57. The Restricted Committee also recalls that, in accordance with Article 20 of the Data Protection Act, the President of the CNIL is not required to send a formal notice to the organization before initiating proceedings sanction against him. 58. Secondly, the Restricted Committee notes that access to the server in question was not governed by any satisfactory access restriction measure insofar as it was possible to access it from a URL composed easily identifiable IP address using port scanner programs, which are available on the web and often used by attackers to detect unsecured or insecure servers. 59. The Restricted Committee also notes that the company had not implemented any server access logging measures, which would nevertheless have made it possible to detect the actions carried out on the server. Indeed, the implementation of a logging of activities, that is to say a recording of activities in ""log files"" or ""logs"", in particular for access to the various servers of an information system , is crucial in that it makes it possible to trace activities and detect any anomalies or events related to security, such as fraudulent access and misuse of personal data. Thus, in its security recommendations for the implementation of a logging system, the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) noted that ""event logs constitute a technical brick essential to the management the security of information systems ""in so far as they can be used ""a priori to detect security incidents"" and a posteriori to ""understand the path of an attack and \[…\] assess its impact"". 60. The Restricted Committee also notes that the data contained in the server could easily be read since they were stored in formats readable by means of a simple text editor or tools available and well documented on the Internet. 61. Thus, the lack of implementation of security measures protecting the server in question, in particular the restriction of access to only persons who should have been authorized, caused the accessibility of the data concerned from the Internet and these data were easily legible due to the format in which they were stored. 62. Thirdly, the Restricted Committee considers that the company's argument, consisting in saying that it would not be liable for the breach of its safety obligations insofar as the error was committed by \[… \], cannot carry conviction. 63. First of all, the Restricted Committee notes that the security flaws do not result from an isolated human error, but from repeated shortcomings, since the company should have taken care to ensure the security of the data in question on several steps. In this respect, when it decided to reuse the data for its internal project, it was up to it to verify that the server used for these purposes was only accessible by authorized persons. The same monitoring requirement was imposed at least on the company when it completed its research project. Also, the company can not reject the responsibility for these repeated shortcomings on an isolated human error \[…\], who, in any event, was acting in his capacity as an employee on the instructions of the company and on his behalf. 64. Next, the security of an information system is based on a set of technical and procedural measures, and not solely on the competence of individuals \[…\]. The effective implementation of these technical and procedural measures should precisely compensate for human shortcomings. The company should therefore have provided additional safeguards. The Restricted Committee considers that this situation reflects an organizational problem within the company. 65. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that SLIMPAY has breached its obligation resulting from the provisions of Article 32 of the Rules. - On the scope of the breach 66. The company maintains that the breach did not cause harm to the persons affected by the personal data breach, none of these persons having informed it of a fraudulent use of their personal data. She explains that she had an audit carried out by a third-party company, the company \[…\], after the discovery of the vulnerability, which revealed that the data present on the server had not been exploited by an attacker. 67. With regard to the scope of this breach, the Restricted Committee notes that it appears from the supplement to the notification sent on February 26, 2020 to the CNIL services that the personal data breach compromised the personal data of 12,478,819 European nationals. 68. The Restricted Committee considers that the absence of proof of fraudulent use of the data has no impact on the characterization of the breach of the security obligation. Indeed, the risk of fraudulent use of personal data was real, independently of the cases of fraud, insofar as the data of many people were made accessible to unauthorized third parties. The absence of proven harm to the persons concerned does not affect the existence of the security defect, which constitutes the breach of Article 32 of the GDPR. 69. The Restricted Committee also recalls that civil status data (title, surname, first name), postal, electronic and telephone contact details, and banking information (BIC/IBAN) have been compromised. 70. It emphasizes in this regard that, given the nature of this personal data, the persons concerned by the breach are exposed to the risk of their personal data being reused by attackers. Indeed, they run the risk that their directly identifying data may be subject to illicit access, resold to third parties and reused in other attack schemes, in particular phishing (or ""phishing""), a technique consisting of pretending to be an official body (social security body, bank, etc.) which, for example, asks its ""prey"" to confirm its bank details. In addition, these people are particularly exposed to the risk of identity theft. b) On the complaint of insufficient robustness of the passwords for access to the user interface 71. The rapporteur notes that the passwords allowing merchants to access their ""customer"" space are kept with the SHA-1 hash function, which is obsolete. It also notes that these passwords may consist of only one character, which does not ensure the security of the data to which they give access. 72. In defence, the company explains that an error crept into the initial information communicated by SLIMPAY during the documentary check. It indicates that the use of the SHA-1 hash function only concerns the old user interface made available by SLIMPAY and currently being decommissioned, and not the current interface. She specifies that access to this old interface has been revoked and that only two merchants are still using this solution, although SLIMPAY has duly notified them of the need to migrate to the new solution as soon as possible. 73. The company adds that the new solution uses the Bcrypt hash function recommended by the CNIL to store passwords on a dedicated database. The latest version of the current interface embeds a so-called ""anti brute-force"" function, which integrates multi-factor authentication and requires the use of a password with a length of 10 to 128 characters, including four types of characters (uppercase, lowercase, number and special character). 74. The Restricted Committee first notes that, in its observations in response to the sanction report, the company transmitted information different from that communicated during the documentary check concerning the hash function used to store the words password allowing merchants to access their ""customer"" area. The company has thus indicated that the use of the deprecated hash function (SHA-1) concerns only the old user interface, which is being decommissioned, and which is used by two merchants. The Restricted Committee then notes that the two merchants in question have been given formal notice to migrate as soon as possible to the latest version of the interface, which uses a satisfactory hash function. Finally, the Restricted Committee observes that the elements of the file do not allow the company's current statements to be called into question. 75. The Restricted Committee therefore takes note of these statements and considers that there is no reason to hold any breach relating to the security obligation due to the insufficient robustness of the passwords for access to the user interface, allowing merchants to access personal data relating to their account. 3. On the breach of the obligation to communicate a breach of personal data to the persons concerned 76. Under Article 34 of the GDPR, “1. Where a breach of personal data is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of a natural person, the controller shall communicate the breach of personal data to the data subject as soon as possible. 2. The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 of this article describes, in clear and simple terms, the nature of the personal data breach and contains at least the information and measures referred to in article 33, paragraph 3, points b), c) and d). 3. The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 is not necessary if one or other of the following conditions is met: a) the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organizational protection measures and these measures have been applied to the personal data affected by the said breach, in particular measures which render the personal data incomprehensible to any person who is not authorized to access it, such as encryption; (b) the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to materialise; (c) it would require disproportionate effort. In this case, instead, a public communication or a similar measure is taken, whereby the persons concerned are informed in an equally effective manner. \[…\] "". 77. Recital 86 of the GDPR provides that, where the breach of personal data is likely to create a high risk for the rights and freedoms of the natural person, the controller should communicate it to the data subject as soon as possible. deadlines so that it can take the necessary precautions. 78. In the present case, the rapporteur notes that following the data breach, the SLIMPAY company, which has a ""procedure for handling personal data breaches"", considered that the risk linked to this ci was not high for the persons concerned and that she should therefore not inform them. 79. The rapporteur considers, however, that in view of the nature of the personal data, the volume of data subjects, the ease of identifying the persons affected by the breach and the possible consequences for the data subjects, the risk associated with the violation can be considered high and that a communication to the persons concerned should have been made. 80. In defence, SLIMPAY indicates that it promptly informed the merchants on whose behalf it had collected the data subject to the data breach, and that they were thus put in a position, in their capacity as data controllers, to inform the persons concerned if they consider it necessary. 81. The company further specifies that, even if the processing carried out for the purpose of improving the fight against fraud was implemented by SLIMPAY as data controller, the data on the basis of which the processing was carried out were initially collected and processed by SLIMPAY as a subcontractor on behalf of these merchants. It was therefore not possible, according to her, to inform the debtors concerned directly without the agreement of these merchants. 82. The company considers in any event that the format of the data and the circumstances surrounding the data breach have led it to conclude that there is no high risk for data subjects within the meaning of Article 34 of the GDPR, with regard to the following elements: - the format of the data did not allow direct understanding of the nature or content of the data; - no disclosure of data attributable to SLIMPAY has been established; - no identity theft or attempted theft has been reported by a debtor to SLIMPAY; - the nature of the data did not make it possible to conclude that there was a high risk of financial fraud; - the risk for a person concerned seemed ineffective insofar as any debtor has the option of opposing an undue debit without justification for eight weeks and up to thirteen months after the transaction with justification. 83. The company also points out that it did not have all the e-mail addresses of the persons concerned. It therefore concludes that the individual information of the debtors would have proved impossible for a large part of them. It also considers that a public communication would not have been relevant insofar as its services being offered to professional clients, the majority of the debtors concerned would not have been able to determine whether or not their data had been processed. by it, acting invisibly as a payment service provider. 84. Firstly, the Restricted Committee considers that the argument put forward by SLIMPAY to free itself from liability, according to which the data on the basis of which the processing was carried out was initially collected and processed by SLIMPAY as a sub - dealing on behalf of merchants, cannot carry conviction. The fact that the data in question was initially processed for another purpose for which the company acts as a processor does not affect its obligation under Article 34 of the GDPR insofar as it reused this data. for its own account, as data controller. 85. Secondly, the Restricted Committee considers that, with regard to the nature of the personal data (including in particular banking information), the volume of data subjects (more than 12 million), the ease of identifying the persons affected by the breach based on the data accessible and the possible consequences for the persons concerned (risks of phishing or identity theft), the risk associated with the breach should be considered high. 86. Thirdly, the Restricted Committee notes that Article 34-3 of the GDPR provides that communication to the data subjects is not necessary in certain cases, in particular if the controller has implemented technical protection measures and organizational measures, whether he has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to people is no longer likely to materialize or whether it would require disproportionate effort. The Restricted Committee considers that the company cannot rely on these provisions insofar as it has not implemented appropriate protection measures to ensure the security of the data affected by the breach (in order to limit their access only to persons allowed). In addition, if the company closed the server concerned, the data remained accessible between November 2015 and February 2020, i.e. for a very long period. 87. With regard then to the company's argument that informing all of the debtors individually would have required disproportionate efforts, the Restricted Committee notes that the company had 6,250,310 e-mail addresses, i.e. approximately half of the people concerned. She could therefore at the very least have informed these people of the data breach, without this representing a disproportionate effort. 88. With regard to the company's argument that a public communication on its website would not have been relevant since the majority of the debtors concerned would not have been able to determine whether or not they had used to the services of SLIMPAY, which operates in an opaque manner as a payment service provider, the Restricted Committee notes first of all that the company's website includes the names of some of its customers and that the debtors of these merchants would have thus able to know that their data was potentially processed by SLIMPAY and possibly affected by the breach. In this regard, it recalls that any natural person may exercise their rights provided for by the GDPR with any company and thus obtain information on the question of whether or not their data is processed by said company. In the event of a public communication, people who so wish could therefore have contacted the company to find out if they were affected by the data breach. Next, the Restricted Committee observes that information relating to a data breach of this magnitude can be found on the web (social networks, newspapers and specialized sites, etc.). Public communication on the organization's website can thus be a starting point and the information can then take on a much more important dimension. 89. In view of these elements, the Restricted Committee considers that the company has failed to comply with its obligations under Article 34 of the GDPR, relating to the communication to the persons concerned of a personal data breach. III. On corrective measures and their publicity 90. Under the terms of III of article 20 of the amended law of January 6, 1978, ""When the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or of this law, the president of the National Commission for Computing and Liberties may also, if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, if necessary in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, seize the restricted formation of the commission with a view to the pronouncement, after adversarial procedure, of one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the annual worldwide turnover total for the previous year, whichever is higher. In the cases mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted committee takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83"". 91. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that ""each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this Article for breaches of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive”, before specifying the elements to be taken into account to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide on the amount of this fine. 92. Firstly, on the principle of imposing a fine, the company argues in defense that such a measure is not justified. The company affirms that it has complied with its legal and regulatory obligations and that it has cooperated with the CNIL diligently and in good faith since becoming aware of the security incident. It stresses in particular that it notified the data breach to the CNIL as soon as it became aware of it within the regulatory period of 72 hours, had investigations carried out which led to the conclusion that there was no risk for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned, implemented corrective measures very quickly and informed the merchants concerned at short notice. 93. The Restricted Committee recalls that it must take into account, for the pronouncement of an administrative fine, the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the violation, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and the categories of personal data affected by the breach. 94. The Restricted Committee notes first of all that the breaches concern a very large number of people, since the data breach affected more than 12 million debtors. 95. The Restricted Committee then notes that the accessible data (title, surname, first name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, BIC/IBAN) make it possible to obtain very precise information on the persons concerned by revealing their identity and their contact details. In addition, specific data are in question when some relate to financial information. The fact that the IBAN appears in particular is not insignificant. As the Banque de France indicated in its book ""Payments and market infrastructures in the digital age"", IBANs are ""sensitive"" payment data (in the ordinary sense of the term) because they can be used to commit fraud. . The European Data Protection Board describes this type of data as ""highly personal"". The Restricted Committee considers that the company should have shown particular vigilance with regard to the security of such data, which can be reused by unauthorized third parties, thus harming the persons affected by the data breach. These are, for example, exposed to a risk of identity theft or phishing (or ""phishing"", i.e. the sending of fraudulent letters for the purpose of obtaining data) when their full identity, associated with their email address for many, was freely accessible. 96. The Restricted Committee finally notes that the data remained accessible for a very long period, between the end of the import of the data on the server in November 2015 and the discovery of the incident by the company on February 14, 2020, and this while the processing concerned, the research project, had ended in July 2016. It appears from the elements in the file that, prior to the occurrence of the data breach, the company had not taken the basic measures in terms of of security. It was only through a report by a merchant that the security defect was brought to the attention of the company. 97. Although the Restricted Committee notes that SLIMPAY immediately reacted to the data breach as soon as it was discovered in February 2020 and that it cooperated throughout the procedure with the CNIL services, it considers that the breach of data results from negligence of basic information system security rules which led to the personal data processed by the company being made accessible to unauthorized third parties. 98. The Restricted Committee recalls that the negligence committed in terms of security was particularly serious: access to the server in question was not governed by any satisfactory access restriction measure, the company had not put in place any server access logging and the data in the server could easily be read. 99. The Restricted Committee notes that this negligence is all the more serious with regard to the sector of activity of the company which also prides itself on being the European leader in recurring payments and which is a company whose management of payment systems 'complex information is the core business. 100. The Restricted Committee also notes that, in breach of Article 34 of the GDPR, the company did not inform the persons concerned of the occurrence of the data breach, when it had more than 6 million e-mail addresses to do so, approximately half of the persons concerned, and that it could have informed the remaining half through a public communication on its site. 101. The Restricted Committee finally recalls that the company has used subcontractors acting under its authority as second-level subcontractors vis-à-vis the merchants, for the services it provides to the latter, without having taken sufficient steps to ensure that the latter present the required guarantees and without having concluded contracts with some of them containing all the clauses provided for in Article 28 paragraph 3 of the GDPR. 102. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that an administrative fine should be imposed with regard to the breaches of Articles 28 paragraphs 3 and 4 of the GDPR, 32 and 34 of the GDPR. 103. Secondly, with regard to the amount of the fine, the company considers that the amount proposed by the rapporteur is disproportionate in view of its economic situation. She insists on her financial deficit and specifies that a high fine would have a catastrophic impact for the jobs she is trying to maintain. 104. The Restricted Committee recalls that paragraph 3 of Article 83 of the Rules provides that in the event of multiple violations, as is the case here, the total amount of the fine may not exceed the amount set for the most serious violation. Insofar as the company is accused of a breach of Articles 28, 32 and 34 of the Regulations, the maximum amount of the fine that can be withheld is 10 million euros or 2% of annual turnover. worldwide, whichever is higher. 105. The Restricted Committee also recalls that administrative fines must be dissuasive but proportionate. It considers in particular that the activity of the company and its financial situation must be taken into account for the determination of the sanction and in particular, in the event of an administrative fine, of its amount. It notes in this respect that the company reports a turnover of \[…\] euros in 2019 and \[…\] euros in 2020, for a net result amounting to \[…\] euros in 2019 and \[ …\] euros in 2020. 106. In view of these elements, the Restricted Committee considers that the imposition of a fine of 180,000 euros appears justified. 107. Thirdly, with regard to the publicity of the sanction, the company SLIMPAY claims that it is trying to find a place for itself on a highly competitive international market of payment service providers, mainly dominated by Chinese companies and Americans, who are not very concerned about the protection of Europeans' data. She adds that she has been making substantial efforts for more than ten years to become a trusted partner for European economic players, specifying that a public sanction would permanently destroy the results obtained thanks to her efforts. 108. The Restricted Committee considers that the publication of the penalty is justified in view of the seriousness of the breaches committed, their persistence and the number of people concerned. FOR THESE REASONS The CNIL Restricted Committee, after having deliberated, decides to: - impose an administrative fine on SLIMPAY in the amount of 180,000 (one hundred and eighty thousand) euros; - make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. President Alexander LINDEN This decision may be appealed to the Council of State within two months of its notification."

The FREE MOBILE company having spoken last; The restricted committee adopted the following decision: I. Facts and procedure 1. The company FREE MOBILE (hereinafter ""the company""), whose head office is located at 16 rue de la ville l´Evêque in Paris (75008), is a subsidiary of the ILIAD group. The company is a mobile telephone operator which markets mobile telephones and / or mobile plans. Created in 2007, it has around 600 employees. 2. For the year 2020, the company FREE MOBILE achieved a turnover of \[…\] euros, for a net profit of \[…\] euros. As of December 21, 2020, the company had approximately \[…\] subscribers to mobile offers, \[…\]. 3. Between December 2018 and November 2019, the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms (hereinafter ""the CNIL"" or ""the Commission"") received 19 complaints against the company FREE MOBILE. The complainants referred in particular to the difficulties encountered in exercising their rights of access or opposition to receive commercial prospecting messages. 4. For the purposes of investigating complaints, two on-site inspections at the premises of the FREE company and then of the FREE MOBILE company were carried out in application of the decision n ° 2019-188C of September 26, 2019 of the president of the CNIL. These missions were carried out on January 21 and 22, 2020, respectively. Pursuant to this same decision, a documentary check was also carried out with the companies FREE MOBILE and FREE on June 3, 2020. 5. The purpose of these missions was to verify compliance by the company FREE MOBILE with all the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter ""the Regulation"" or ""the RGPD"") and of the law n ° 78-17 of January 6, 1978 modified relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter ""the law of January 6, 1978 modified"" or the ""Data Protection Act and Freedoms ""). 6. During the first two checks, the CNIL delegation endeavored to verify the management, by the company FREE MOBILE, of the rights of individuals, and more particularly the way in which it had handled requests for the exercise of rights. people who have referred to the Complaints Commission. These checks were also intended to verify the security measures put in place by the company to protect the personal data it processes. 7. At the end of these checks, the minutes n ° 2019-188 / 1 and n ° 2019-188 / 2 were notified to the company FREE MOBILE by letter dated January 23, 2020. The company forwarded to the Commission services, by emails of 3 and 10 February 2020, the additional documents requested at the end of these control missions. 8. In view of the responses provided by the company, and in order to clarify certain findings previously made, a new documentary check was carried out by the CNIL on June 3, 2020, which resulted in the sending of a questionnaire. to the company FREE MOBILE. 9. The company sent the Commission services, by email of 29 June 2020, the additional documents and information requested during this check. 10. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission appointed, on December 17, 2020, Mr. François PELLEGRINI as rapporteur on the basis of article 22 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended and informed the company by letter of December 23, 2020. 11. At the end of his investigation, the rapporteur, on August 2, 2021, notified the company FREE MOBILE of a report detailing the breaches of the GDPR that he considered to be in the present case. The report notification letter told the company that it had a period of one month to communicate its written observations in accordance with the provisions of article 40 of Decree No. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019. 12. This report proposed to the restricted formation of the Commission to issue an injunction to bring the processing into line with the provisions of Articles 15, 16, 21, 25 and 32 of the GDPR, together with a fine for each day of delay. 'after a period of three months following the notification of the deliberation of the restricted formation, as well as an administrative fine. He also proposed that this decision be made public, but that it be no longer possible to identify the company by name after a period of two years from its publication. 13. On September 13, 2021, the company filed its observations in response to the sanction report. 14. On September 23, 2021, the rapporteur requested a deadline to respond to the observations made by the company FREE MOBILE. By letter of September 24, 2021, the chairman of the restricted formation informed the rapporteur that he had an additional six days to submit his observations. By letter dated the same day, the company was informed by the chairman of the restricted party that it also had an additional six days to file its observations. 15. By letter of October 4, 2021, the rapporteur's response to the company's observations was sent to him, accompanied by a notice to attend the restricted training session on November 4, 2021. 16. On October 22, 2021, the company FREE MOBILE produced new observations in response to those of the rapporteur. 17. The company and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the session of the restricted formation. II. Reasons for the decision A. On the processing responsibility of the FREE MOBILE company 18. Article 4, paragraph 7 of the GDPR provides that the controller is ""the natural or legal person, public authority, service or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of treatment "". 19. In his report, the rapporteur first underlines that the delegation was informed during the on-site inspection of January 21, 2020 that ""the company FREE MOBILE is the mobile radio telecommunications operator of the ILIAD group and the company FREE is the fixed telecommunications operator of the ILIAD group ""and that"" each customer is attached to the company FREE and / or the company FREE MOBILE ""depending on the offer to which he has subscribed. The rapporteur then notes that each of the FREE MOBILE and FREE companies ""has its own information system in which \[its\] customers appear"" and that the ""prospect databases are also distributed by company"", so that companies can access to their own databases. A common database is also used by each of the companies, on its own behalf, in order to carry out commercial prospecting. The rapporteur finally observes that the processing register sent to the CNIL delegation indicates that the FREE MOBILE company considers itself responsible in particular for processing relating to the management of contracts signed with it by its subscribers and processing related to prospecting operations. that are carried out with its customers and prospects on its behalf. 20. The restricted committee notes that these elements were not contested by the company FREE MOBILE. It considers that it follows from the foregoing that the FREE MOBILE company must be regarded as responsible for the processing of the personal data of its customers, implemented within the framework of the execution of mobile telephone subscription contracts, and of the people it contacts for commercial prospecting purposes, insofar as it determines the purposes and means of such processing. B. On the company's grievances in connection with the procedure 21. The company considers that the rapporteur failed in his duty of diligence by sending it, more than eighteen months after the control operations and during the August holidays, the report proposing to the restricted committee to retain a sanction against him. The company argues, on the basis of an average that it indicates to have established from the decisions of the restricted committee rendered between 2018 and 2021 following an on-site check, that the average time for transmission of the procedure to the restricted formation is approximately thirteen months and, in this case, this period has been extended to eighteen months. The company also claims that it was not able to take cognizance, before receiving the report, of two complaints on which the rapporteur relied to hold against it a breach of its obligation to ensure security of processing. Finally, the company is surprised not to have been previously given formal notice to correct the breaches at the origin of the disputed facts, which would demonstrate the low seriousness of the breaches alleged by the rapporteur, in particular with regard to its procedures for security. 22. First, the restricted committee notes that the applicable texts do not provide for a limit to the time between the conduct of checks and the transmission of a report proposing a sanction. In addition, this procedure intervened during the health crisis, which resulted in an extension of the deadlines. 23. Second, with regard to the two referrals n ° 19012802 and n ° 19019490 for which the company claims that it was not able to take cognizance of them before receiving the report, the restricted panel recalls that the applicable texts do not require a preliminary investigation of complaints before the transmission of a report proposing a sanction and do not prevent the rapporteur from bringing them to the attention of the data controller at the stage of his report, the complaints being on this occasion paid to the adversarial procedure. Finally, article 50 of the CNIL's internal regulations only requires that the subject of the complaint be ""communicated to the processing manager involved \[…\] so that the latter provides all the necessary explanations"", which was done in this case through the sanction report. 24. Thirdly, with regard to the transmission of the report in August and the need for the company to respond to it during the summer vacation, the restricted committee observes that the company has benefited from a delay. approximately six weeks to produce its first observations, to take this period into account, bearing in mind that article 40 of decree n ° 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 only imposes a minimum period of one month. 25. Lastly, with regard to the complaint relating to the lack of prior formal notice, the restricted committee firstly notes that it emerges from the provisions of article 20 of the law ""Informatique et Libertés"" amended by law n ° 2018-493 of June 20, 2018 that the supervisory authority has a set of corrective measures, adapted according to the specific characteristics of each case, which can be combined with each other and be preceded or not by a notice. Corrective measures can be taken directly in all cases. 26. The restricted formation also notes that the Constitutional Council (Cons. Const., June 12, 2018, n ° 2018-765 DC) did not issue a reservation concerning the possibility for the president of the CNIL to engage a sanction procedure without prior formal notice. Finally, the restricted formation recalls that the Council of State ruled (CE, October 9, 2020, Société SERGIC, n ° 433311) that ""it clearly follows \[from the provisions of article 20 of the law of January 6, 1978 amended \], that the pronouncement of a sanction by the restricted formation of the CNIL is not subject to the prior intervention of a formal notice from the controller or his subcontractor by the president of the CNIL \[… \] "". 27. Consequently, the restricted committee considers that the present procedure and the various actions carried out in this context have not infringed the rights of the defense of the company. C. On the qualification of the facts with regard to the GDPR 1. On the breach of the obligation to respect the right of access of individuals to personal data concerning them 28. Article 12, paragraph 3, of the GDPR provides that ""The controller shall provide the data subject with information on the measures taken following a request made pursuant to Articles 15 to 22, as soon as possible and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. If necessary, this period may be extended by two months, taking into account the complexity and number of requests. The controller informs the person concerned for this extension and the reasons for the postponement within one month of receipt of the request "". In addition, under paragraph 4 of this article ""if the controller does not respond to the request made by the data subject, he shall inform the latter without delay and at the latest within a period of one month from the receipt of the request of the reasons for its inaction and the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and of lodging a judicial appeal "". 29. Article 15 (1) of the GDPR provides for the right of a person to obtain from the controller confirmation that personal data concerning him or her are or are not being processed and, when they are, the 'access to personal data concerning him and in particular ""when the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any information available as to their source"". Under paragraph 3 of the same article ""the controller provides a copy of the personal data being processed"". 30. The rapporteur is based on three referrals received by the CNIL, from Messrs \[…\] (complaint n ° 19018344), \[…\] (complaint n ° 19008608) and \[…\] (complaint n ° 19016049), within the framework of which the complainants reported on the difficulties encountered in the exercise of their rights, to suggest to the restricted committee to consider that the company has violated its obligations under Article 15 of the GDPR. 31. In defense, the company argues that it cannot be accused of any breach of these three referrals. It indicates that these are isolated facts, on the basis of which the existence of a systemic problem cannot be inferred. It also points out the difference between the reduced number of complaints noted in the exercise of rights report (7) and the number of requests for exercise of rights processed by the company per year (around 600). It therefore considers that the alleged breaches are indicative of human error but not at all of a ""problem with the very functioning of the procedure"" of FREE MOBILE. Finally, the company indicates that the disputed referrals are contemporaneous with the date of entry into force of the GDPR and prior to the implementation of a new ticketing tool used by FREE MOBILE, since June 2019, which made it possible to provide improvements to the procedure for processing requests to exercise the right of FREE MOBILE. Therefore, it considers that these occasional dysfunctions have now been resolved. 32. First of all, with regard to referral n ° 19008608 of May 2019, Mr. \[…\] applied to the CNIL, explaining that he had asked the company FREE MOBILE, via the e-mail address dedicated to ""Computing and Freedoms"" requests. , access to data concerning him which would be associated with his telephone number. 33. The rapporteur observes that it emerges from the information communicated by the company following the checks that, although the company does indicate that it has received the complainant's request, it has on the other hand ""not found any trace of an answer given to the complainant. "". The rapporteur therefore considers that the company failed in its obligation to process the complainant's access request. 34. In defense, the company explains first of all that it could not meet this request since it no longer had the requested data. It specifies in this sense that Mr. \[…\] having terminated his contract with the company FREE MOBILE four years before sending his request for access, it only had information relating to the existence of a contractual relationship. until March 4, 2015. Following the questioning of the rapporteur, who was surprised at the absence of personal data relating to the complainant which would be kept by the company in an intermediate archiving base in accordance with its legal or accounting obligations ( billing data, management of any litigation, etc.), in its second defense, the company indicates that it found thirteen invoices concerning the complainant after a search in its archiving database and sent, by email of October 14, 2021, a further response to the complainant providing them with these elements. 35. The restricted committee firstly recalls that it emerges from Article 12, paragraph 4, of the GDPR that when the controller no longer holds data on the person exercising his right of access (for example if the data have been deleted), he must nevertheless respond to the requester within a maximum of one month to indicate this. Thus, the restricted panel considers that the company should at the very least have informed the complainant that, according to it, it no longer had any information concerning him, apart from that relating to the existence of a contractual relationship until March 4, 2015. 36. The restricted committee then notes that the company had other data relating to the complainant, in this case the thirteen invoices kept by the company in its intermediate archiving database, which fall within the scope of the data to be communicated under the right of access. In this regard, the restricted committee recalls that the persons concerned must be able to be aware of the fact that data concerning them is kept and processed by the data controller, including several years after the termination of the contractual relationship, as is the case case in this case. Indeed, it emphasizes that only the communication of this data allows the data subjects to measure the nature and extent of the processing carried out by the company. In the present case, the restricted panel noted that it was not until the sending of the email of October 14, 2021 that the company provided an exhaustive response to the complainant's request for access, that is to say more than two years. after Mr. \[…\] had exercised his rights, following the initiation of the sanction procedure and the receipt of the report in response to the observations of the company dated October 4, 2021. 37. Under these conditions, the restricted committee considers that by not responding to the access request and by not responding to the requester within the prescribed time limits, the company has violated its obligations under Articles 12 and 15 of the GDPR. 38. It nevertheless notes that, in the context of the sanction procedure, the company has justified having provided a response to the complainant and, therefore, having taken measures to comply with the obligations of the GDPR. 39. Second, with regard to referral no.19016049 of September 2019, Mr. \[…\] applied to the CNIL, explaining that he had asked the FREE MOBILE company to indicate to it whether it had any personal data concerning him. If so, the complainant wished to obtain a copy of his data and, more particularly, a copy of the recording of a call which would have been made by a person having usurped his identity as well as any document which would have been sent to that person. opportunity. 40. The rapporteur notes that it emerges from the findings made in the context of the control procedure that the company did not respond to the complainant, without being able to justify the reason. He also noted that this request was not qualified as a ""Computing and Freedoms"" request but as a ""termination"" request. The rapporteur therefore considers that the company failed in its obligation to inform the complainant whether personal data concerning him were included in the processing operations it implements and, where applicable, in its obligation to send him a copy. . 41. In defense, the company argues that this request was not addressed to the service dedicated to requests for the exercise of rights, so that a human error may have been committed in its classification as a request for termination and not as a request for a right of access. Next, the company explains that it could not provide a favorable response to the complainant as his request for access related to the personal data of a third party. Regarding the other data held by the company, relating to the complainant, it indicates that it responded by email of August 26, 2021, attaching a copy of the personal data concerning him which are stored in the database. 42. On the first point relating to the address to which the complainant sent his request, the restricted panel considers that if it is not disputed that the complainant did not send his request to the email or postal address which is identified by the company as being the dedicated channel for the transmission of requests for the exercise of rights, the fact remains that it belonged to the company, since this request has been received by the latter and that it was clear in its terms, to process it within the time limits provided for by the GDPR and to ensure that it is transmitted to the competent services. Indeed, if the implementation of organizational measures to facilitate the exercise of the rights of individuals complies with the requirements and the objective pursued by the GDPR, this cannot however exonerate the company from its obligation to respond to requests that are sent to it when they are not sent to it through the channel it will have dedicated for this purpose, a fortiori when, as is the case in this case, the content of the request is clear. 43. On the second point in connection with the company's argument that the request for access related to data from a third party, the restricted panel notes that the complainant's request is, primarily, a general request for right of access which aims, in the alternative, the communication of data relating to a telephone call. Therefore, if the restricted committee can hear the elements put forward by the company on the need to preserve the rights of third parties in connection with the part of the request relating to the telephone call, it considers on the other hand that the company would have in any event had to provide a response to the general request for the right of access made by the complainant, which was not the case before August 26, 2021, i.e. more than two years after his request and after the notification to the company on August 2, 2021 of the report proposing that the restricted party issue a sanction. 44. Under these conditions, the restricted committee considers that by not responding to the access request and by not responding to the requester within the prescribed time limits, the company has violated its obligations under Articles 12 and 15 of the GDPR. 45. It nevertheless notes that, within the framework of the sanction procedure, the company has justified having provided a response to the complainant and therefore having taken measures to comply with the obligations of the GDPR. 46. Thirdly, with regard to referral n ° 19018344 dated October 2019, Mr. \[…\] seized the CNIL, explaining that he had asked the company FREE MOBILE for access to his data. 47. The rapporteur notes that the company has not provided a response to the complainant. 48. In defense, the company explained that it never received the complainant's request and therefore could not respond to it. 49. Insofar as it has not been established that the complainant regularly exercised his rights, the restricted panel considers that there is no reason to find a breach with regard to the obligation to respect the right to access regarding this complaint. 50. Lastly, with regard first of all to the argument according to which the facts alleged against the company are isolated in nature and therefore do not constitute a breach of the applicable provisions, the restricted panel considers that, if the complaints received by the CNIL do not in fact reveal the existence of a structural breach in terms of the right of access, the fact remains that the company has failed to comply with its obligations in processing gentlemen's requests \[…\] and \[…\], While these were clearly formulated. These facts constitute a breach of the obligations arising from articles 12 and 15 of the GDPR. 51. Next with regard to the argument according to which the breaches which are alleged against the company are contemporaneous with the date of entry into application of the GDPR, the restricted committee recalls that most of the obligations in question, relating to the rights of access, rectification of opposition and security, existed before the entry into application of the RGPD and that the law ""Data processing and Freedoms"" already made it possible to sanction them. The restricted committee therefore considers that the company cannot usefully plead a change in the legal framework to justify the lack of compliance on the day of the checks. 52. Finally, with regard to the improvements made by the company to its rights management procedure, while emphasizing the advisability of their adoption to improve the processing of requests, the restricted committee recalls that they have no impact on the existence failure to keep up to date with the checks, which lasted for many months, and which was only brought to an end after the initiation of the sanction procedure. 53. In view of the foregoing, the restricted committee considers that a breach of the obligations of articles 12 and 15 of the RGPD is constituted for the complaints lodged by Messrs \[…\] and \[…\], not important that it does not have not of a structural nature. 54. It nevertheless notes that, in the context of the sanction procedure, the company has justified having taken measures to comply with the obligations of the GDPR by providing a response to the complainants. 2. On the breach relating to the right of rectification in application of Article 16 of the GDPR 55. Article 16 of the GDPR provides for the right of a person to obtain from the controller ""the rectification of personal data concerning him which is inaccurate"". 56. The rapporteur is based on a referral received by the CNIL, from Mrs. \[…\] (complaint n ° 19017852 made in October 2019) and in which the complainant mentioned difficulties encountered in the exercise of her right rectification, to suggest that the restricted party consider that the company has violated its obligations under Article 16 of the GDPR. She indicated that she had asked the company to correct her postal address appearing on the telephone bills, which had been made necessary following the renumbering of the road by the town hall. 57. The rapporteur observes that it emerges from the findings made during the control of 22 January 2020 that the complainant's request, made in September 2019, was not taken into account since the postal address subject of the request correction which appears on the invoice dated October 14, 2019 from the complainant is the same as that which appears on the invoice dated January 14, 2020. The rapporteur therefore considered that between October 14, 2019 and January 14, 2020, the The complainant's request for rectification was not taken into account by the company FREE MOBILE, ie several weeks after sending his request. 58. In defense, the company argues that faster processing of Madam's request \[…\] was impossible in view of the imperatives of the fight against fraud. It specifies that when a person is both a customer of the companies FREE (because holder of a fixed line) and FREE MOBILE (because holder of a mobile line), as is the case of the complainant, he The postal address relating to the landline must first be changed with the company FREE. It specifies that this modification can only take place once the physical address of the installation of the telephone line has been modified in a tool called ""SETIAR"", which is administered by the company ORANGE SA The company specifies that this tool ""makes it possible to ensure the perfect correspondence between a telephone number and the physical installation address of the telephone line, in order to avoid any error when carrying out an operation on this line"". The company indicates that these various steps cannot be completed in a short time and that it has acted diligently to process this request. The company considers in any event to have responded to Madame's request \[...\] by sending her a letter on September 17, 2019, i.e. four days after receiving her request, telling her that she could change her address online, directly from their subscriber area. 59. The restricted committee noted that the need for Mrs. \[…\] to modify her address herself in her subscriber area should have been better explained to her. During the meeting, however, the company clearly explained the need, in the context of the fight against fraud, to use the ""SETIAR"" tool. 60. In these conditions, the restricted committee takes note of the elements provided by the company in defense and considers that, with regard to this complaint, the elements of the debate do not allow to conclude that there is a breach committed by the company. company. 3. On the breach relating to the obligation to respect the opposition request of the persons concerned 61. Article 12, paragraph 3, of the GDPR provides that ""The controller shall provide the data subject with information on the measures taken following a request made pursuant to Articles 15 to 22, as soon as possible and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. If necessary, this period may be extended by two months, taking into account the complexity and number of requests. The controller informs the person concerned for this extension and the reasons for the postponement within one month of receipt of the request. , unless the person concerned requests otherwise "". Finally, under the terms of paragraph 4 of this article ""if the controller does not respond to the request made by the data subject, he shall inform the latter without delay and at the latest within a period of one month from the receipt of the request of the reasons for its inaction and the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and of lodging a judicial appeal "". 62. Article 21 of the GDPR provides that ""when personal data is processed for prospecting purposes, the data subject has the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data relating to such prospecting purposes, including profiling insofar as it is linked to such prospecting "". 63. The rapporteur is based on four referrals received by the CNIL, from Mrs. \[…\] (complaint n ° 19008223) as well as from Messrs \[…\] (complaint n ° 19016318) and \[…\] (complaints n ° 17017795 and n ° 19018125) and in which the complainants reported their difficulties in exercising their rights, to suggest to the restricted panel to consider that the company has violated its obligations under Article 21 of the GDPR. 64. In defense, the company argues that it cannot be accused of any breach of these four referrals, as it has taken into account the complainants' requests in its databases. It then argues, in summary and as developed in point 31, that the alleged shortcomings, given the low number of complaints referred to in the report, are at most indicative of human errors and not of a problem with the functioning of the procedure for processing requests for the exercise of rights by the company, which would constitute a breach of the applicable provisions. It considers that the disputed referrals are contemporaneous with the date of entry into force of the GDPR and prior to the implementation of the new ticketing tool in June 2019, which made it possible to improve the processing of requests for the exercise of rights. 65. First, with regard to referral n ° 19008223 made in April 2019, Madam \[…\] applied to the CNIL, explaining that during the years 2018 and 2019, she had been the subject of telephone canvassing by the company FREE MOBILE. During this period, the complainant expressed on two occasions, by letters dated September 27, 2018 and April 29, 2019, her opposition to the processing of her personal data for prospecting purposes. 66. The rapporteur notes that it emerges from the findings made by the control delegation that the complainant was the subject of two prospecting campaigns on 28 August 2018 and on 11 April 2019. The rapporteur therefore considers that the complainant was made the recipient of commercial prospecting nearly eight months after having, for the first time, expressed its opposition. 67. In defense, the company admits that a ""human error"" was committed, so that the complainant was the subject of a prospecting campaign in April 2019 when she had previously exercised her right of opposition . However, the company considers that no breach can be held against it insofar as it has ""duly taken into account"" the complainant's opposition formulated by letter of April 29, 2019, i.e. before the on-site inspections. which the CNIL carried out in January 2020. 68. On this last point, the restricted committee considers that the existence of a breach cannot be limited to the elements attesting to a non-conformity on the date of the findings made within the framework of an inspection carried out in application of the article 19 of the law ""Informatique et Libertés"", but can also be based on any element obtained by the services of the CNIL or the reporter, attesting to a non-conformity for facts giving rise to a complaint to the CNIL and a referral to the restricted committee, even if at the time of the control this non-compliance was brought to an end. In this case, the breach is based on evidence, and is therefore established. 69. Under these conditions, the restricted committee considers that by not taking into account the complainant's opposition to the processing of her personal data for prospecting purposes within the prescribed time limits, the company has failed to comply with its obligations arising from the Articles 12 and 21 of the GDPR. 70. It nevertheless notes that, in the context of the sanction procedure, the company has justified having taken into account the complainant's opposition request and therefore having taken measures to comply with the obligations of the GDPR. 71. Secondly, with regard to referral n ° 19016318 made in September 2019, from Mr. \[…\], he explained that he had been the subject of commercial prospecting by SMS on offers marketed by the company FREE MOBILE until July 2019, and provided screenshots of the corresponding SMS in its complaint. The complainant indicates that he has repeatedly expressed his opposition to the processing of his personal data for commercial prospecting purposes, in particular in June 2018 to the Data Protection Officer (hereinafter ""the DPO"") of the ILIAD group. 72. The rapporteur observes that it emerges from the additional information communicated by the company following the checks that the company had ""at the date of this communication, not found any trace of an answer given to the complainant"" without being able to 'justify the reason. It therefore considers that the company did not take into account the complainant's opposition to receiving commercial prospecting since the latter continued to receive solicitations until July 2019, i.e. almost a year after having expressed his opposition. 73. In defense, the company indicates that it “promptly” took into account the complainant's request, as of July 25, 2018, after having received two emails from him on June 10 and July 8, 2018. The company attached a capture to this effect. screen showing the date of registration of the complainant in an ""anti prospecting"" database. With regard to the screenshots attached by the complainant, the company argues that they are ""devoid of probative value since the recipient's number does not appear, so that it has not been established that the SMS captured by the complainant were actually received by him "". However, it does not dispute the failure to respond to the complainant's request for opposition. She indicates that the new ticketing tool put in place from June 2019 now makes it possible to ensure a systematic response to the people concerned. 74. The restricted panel considers that even if the company indicates that it took into account ""promptly"" the complainant's request, this does not mean that it provided a response, since the latter received none and therefore did not receive any information as to whether his request had been taken into account, which is contrary to the provisions of Article 12 of the GDPR. 75. Then, if it is correct that the telephone number does not appear on the screenshots sent by the complainant, the restricted committee notes that it is frequent and understandable that people who file a complaint with the CNIL transmit screenshots of messages received to their phone, which logically does not allow the phone number of the recipient of the message to appear. It also observes that the requests appearing in the screenshots communicated by the complainant do refer to dates subsequent to the taking into account of the complainant's request for the right to object, confirmed by the DPO, since they mention offers valid between December 11, 2018 and July 11, 2019. Thus, the restricted committee notes that there is no element to justify doubting the good faith of the complainant. Finally, the restricted committee recalls that the right to object is attached to a person and not to a telephone number. The restricted committee therefore considers that these screenshots reveal that the complainant continued to receive solicitations almost a year after having expressed his opposition to the DPO of the ILIAD group in June 2018. 76. Finally, the restricted committee recalls that the improvements made by the ticketing tool have no impact on the existence and materiality of the breach, both with regard to the provisions resulting from Article 12 of the GDPR (lack of response from the company to the complainant) than its article 21 (Mr. \[…\] having continued to receive commercial prospecting almost a year after having expressed his opposition to the use of his data for this purpose). 77. In these conditions, the restricted committee considers that by not taking into account the complainant's opposition to the processing of his personal data for prospecting purposes within the prescribed time limits, the company has failed to comply with its obligations arising from articles 12 and 21 of the GDPR. 78. It nevertheless notes that, in the context of the sanction procedure, the company has justified having taken measures to comply with the obligations arising from Articles 12 and 21 of the GDPR. 79. Lastly, with regard to referrals n ° 17017795, of September 2017 and n ° 19018125, of October 2019, from Mr. \[…\], he explained that he was the subject of several resumption of prospecting by SMS and by mail from the company FREE MOBILE relating to the marketing of offers, in particular that relating to the ""Free package with unlimited calls \[…\]"". He indicates that he has expressed by mail on several occasions, from March 2015, his opposition to the processing of his personal data for commercial prospecting purposes and yet continued to receive commercial solicitations until October 2019. 80. By email of 21 September 2018, the Commission services reminded the company of its obligations in terms of commercial prospecting and asked it to no longer process the complainant's data for this commercial purpose. By email of October 3, 2018, the DPO of the ILIAD group replied that he had taken the request into account and ""deleted the contact details of Mr. \[…\]"". 81. The rapporteur observes that it emerges from the elements raised during the inspection that, despite the requests made by the complainant since 2015 and the assertion of the DPO of the ILIAD group in 2018 by which he confirms ""having deleted the contact details of Mr. \[... \] "", its opposition to the processing of its data for prospecting purposes was not taken into account until December 17, 2019, more than four years after the company received its first request. 82. In defense, the company indicates that it never received a request for opposition from the complainant, unlike the company FREE. It considers that an opposition request filed with the company FREE is not opposable to the company FREE MOBILE. However, it indicates that it took into account the wishes of the complainant when he ""activated the anti-canvassing option on his subscriber area"". It specifies that this opposition has been effective since December 17, 2019. The company then specifies that the email produced by the rapporteur, indicating that the DPO of the ILIAD group confirms ""having deleted the contact details of Mr. \[…\]"", is a reconstruction of an email and not the original, which does not constitute admissible proof, and it also notes that the email was not sent to the right contacts and that it was not the responsibility of the FREE MOBILE company to take take into account the complainant's objection request. 83. Regarding first of all the failure to receive the complainant's opposition request by the company, the restricted panel notes that the DPO of the ILIAD group - who, by email of 3 October 2018, informed the CNIL ""having removed the contact details of Mr. \[…\]"" - is the DPO in charge of requests relating to FREE subscribers and FREE MOBILE subscribers. The restricted committee considers that it was therefore incumbent on it to process this request as a whole or to pass it on, if necessary, to the competent services so that it is taken into account. 84. Consequently, the company's argument that it was the sole responsibility of the FREE company to take into account the complainant's request cannot be accepted. Indeed, the complainant's request was a general objection to receiving commercial prospecting by post and by electronic means (SMS and email) which concerned both the company FREE and the company FREE MOBILE. In his letter of March 5, 2015 addressed to the ""Computing and Liberties"" department of the company FREE, the complainant had taken care to specify his Free Mobile and Free box identifiers and to formulate his request as follows: ""In accordance with the provisions of article 38 paragraph 2 of the law of January 6, 1978 amended, I ask you to delete my contact details from your advertising contact files, whether by post, telephone or computer. "". 85. Finally, regarding the inadmissibility of the email of 3 October 2018 confirming the receipt and consideration of the complainant's request by the DPO of the ILIAD group, the restricted panel observes that the latter does not appear in its original form in the business tool of the CNIL (business tool in which the elements related to the processing of a complaint are recorded). This email was recorded in the form of a ""communication"", which is a tab in the business tool allowing the agent in charge of the complaint not to record as such the email as an attachment to the file but to '' manually indicate that he has received an email from the company, by entering the date of receipt, selecting the sender of the message from a list of pre-defined choices and copying the content of the original message. The restricted committee considers, therefore, that the way in which this email has been reproduced corresponds to a procedure provided for in the CNIL business tool and that it can take it into account insofar as all the relevant elements appear therein, that is to say the date, the content of the text and the identity of its author, and that they clearly have a direct link with the subject of the complaint. Finally, the restricted committee notes that, while the company disputes the admissibility of this email, it does not however indicate that it never sent this message. 86. Therefore, the restricted panel considers that the company's arguments are not such as to call into question the fact that the complainant's opposition was only taken into account as of December 17, 2019, which corresponds according to the company to the date on which the complainant activated ""the anti-canvassing option on his subscriber area"", which took place more than a year after the indication by the DPO of the ILIAD group, on October 3 2018, the effective taking into account of this request, initially formulated on March 5, 2015. 87. Under these conditions, the restricted committee considers that by not taking into account the complainant's opposition to the processing of his personal data for prospecting purposes within the prescribed time limits, the company has violated its obligations arising from articles 12 and 21 of the GDPR. 88. It nevertheless notes that the company has justified having taken measures to comply with the obligations arising from Articles 12 and 21 of the GDPR. 89. In view of the foregoing, the restricted committee considers that a breach of the obligations of Articles 12 and 21 of the GDPR has been established for the complaints lodged by Madam \[…\], Gentlemen \[…\] and \[…\]. 4. On the breach of the obligation to protect personal data from the design stage 90. Under the terms of article 25 of the GDPR ""1. Taking into account the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks, whose degree of probability and severity varies, which the processing presents for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller implements, both when determining the means of processing and at the time of processing itself , appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as pseudonymisation, which are intended to implement the principles relating to data protection, for example data minimization, in an effective manner and to provide the processing with the necessary guarantees in order to respond the requirements of this Regulation and to protect the rights of the data subject \[…\] "". 91. The rapporteur is based on two referrals to the CNIL in November 2019, from Messrs \[…\] (complaint n ° 19019626) and \[…\] (complaint n ° 19020342) and in which the complainants stated that '' they did not manage to stop the sending, by the company FREE MOBILE, of invoices on which the mention of a terminated mobile line appeared, in order to suggest to the restricted party to consider that the company had disregarded its obligations resulting from the Article 25 of the GDPR. 92. In defense, the company explains first of all that it sends invoices at zero euros to customers after the termination of their subscription because they benefit from a so-called ""multi-line"" subscription. The company specifies that this service allows a subscriber to attach to a main mobile line, one or more secondary lines, which has the effect of grouping the invoices of the different lines on the main account associated with the main line, and to proceed to a single direct debit corresponding to the sum of the associated lump sums. The company thus argues that ""the processing of the telephone number corresponding to the terminated main \[mobile\] line is necessary, since it pursues purposes aimed at allowing FREE MOBILE to continue the proper performance of their contract by identifying the debtor of the multiple lines subscribed by its subscribers and to improve for the subscribers, the readability of the invoicing of their subscriptions and of the debits made on their account "". Then, the company nevertheless specifies that it has initiated an overhaul of its invoicing procedure so that the invoices of the multiline accounts associated with a terminated main mobile line now include the mention of an identifier allowing the subscriber and the FREE MOBILE company to namely, for billing purposes, who is the sole debtor of the lines, without continuing to mention the terminated primary line on the invoice. 93. The restricted training notes that it follows from Article 25 of the above-mentioned GDPR that data controllers must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to effectively comply with the principles relating to data protection. 94. The restricted committee considers that if the information that a person has held a terminated mobile line can actually be kept for the purposes of executing the contract and for accounting purposes, or even for the management of litigation, On the other hand, it is not necessary to continue to process this information within the framework of the issuance of current invoices, and to display it on the latter, whereas the use of an identifier allowing the debtor to be identified different mobile lines (main and secondary) can be used instead. The company should have planned, from the design stage, organizational and technical measures to no longer process this data in this context following a request for termination of a main line by the person concerned. 95. Under these conditions, the restricted committee considers that the aforementioned facts constitute a breach of article 25 of the RGPD since the company has not implemented the organizational and technical measures allowing to proceed with the erasure of the data. of a personal nature that were no longer needed for billing purposes. 96. It nevertheless notes that, in the context of the sanction procedure, the company has justified having carried out an overhaul of its invoicing procedure, so that the invoices now only include the mention of active lines, without mention of canceled lines. The restricted formation therefore considers that the company has complied with the obligations arising from Article 25 of the GDPR. 5. The breach relating to the obligation to ensure the security of personal data 97. Article 32 of the GDPR provides that: ""Taking into account the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks, including the degree of probability and severity varies, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee a level of security adapted to the risk (…) ""and , in particular, ""the means to ensure the continued confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services"" and a ""procedure to regularly test, analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing "". 98. In the first place, the rapporteur relies on two referrals from Mesdames \[…\] (complaint n ° 19012802 of July 2019) and \[…\] (complaint n ° 19019490 of October 2019) and in the context of which the complainants made status of the absence of systematic user authentication to access a FREE MOBILE user account (for the user with a telephone equipped with a FREE MOBILE SIM card or for a person benefiting from the connection sharing of a user with a telephone equipped with a FREE MOBILE SIM card), to offer the restricted training the opportunity to consider that the company has violated its obligations under article 32 of the GDPR. 99. In defense, the company argues that the CNIL's checks did not cover these complaints and that access to a subscriber's mobile space from another device via connection sharing is not possible. 100. In view of the information provided by the company, the restricted committee considers that there is no reason to find a breach of Article 32 of the GDPR for these facts. 101. Secondly, the rapporteur observes that it emerges from the findings made within the framework of the control procedure that the company sends by email, in clear, the passwords of the users when they subscribe to an offer with the FREE MOBILE company. 102. In defense, the company first asserts that, as data controller, it is free to choose the security measures to be put in place and that the guides and recommendations issued by the CNIL or the National Agency of the security of information systems (ANSSI) are not mandatory and do not have the force of law. Therefore, the company considers that no breach can be accepted in the absence of a ""serious breach of the security obligation, materialized by the occurrence of a breach of personal data"", which does not is not the case in the present case according to her. 103. The company goes on to argue that at the time of the control operations, subscribers were encouraged to change their passwords in their subscriber area and made aware of the importance of keeping these passwords confidential. It further indicates that the initial password assigned by the FREE MOBILE company has a high level of robustness. Finally, it specifies that the subscriber area only allows access to ""basic"" information and not to sensitive information. 104. First of all, the restricted training recalls that, in application of article 32 of the RGPD, to ensure the protection of personal data, it is the responsibility of the data controller to take ""appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee a level of security adapted to the risk "". The restricted committee considers that in this case, the methods of transmission of passwords implemented by the company are not suitable with regard to the risk that the data subject would pose to the capture of their username and password. goes through a third party. Indeed, the transmission, in clear, of a password which is neither temporary nor of single use and whose renewal is not imposed, makes it easily and immediately usable by a third who would have an improper access. to the message that contains it. This third party could thus access all the personal data present in the FREE MOBILE user account of the person concerned (in particular the last name, first name, mobile line number, postal address, e-mail address, bank identity statement, line number. mobile). He could also access his voicemail, download his invoices and the statement of his consumption, modify the password, the e-mail address or the account options. Just because the password itself is strong and people are encouraged to change their password is not enough to offset these risks, which can lead to identity theft and phishing attempts, among other things. Therefore, taking into account these risks for the protection of personal data and the privacy of individuals leads the limited training to consider that the measures deployed to guarantee data security in this case are insufficient. 105. Next, the restricted committee specifies that while deliberation n ° 2017-012 of January 19, 2017, the purpose of which is to provide recommendations relating to passwords, the CNIL guide relating to the security of personal data and the ANSSI technical note relating to the passwords cited in the rapporteur's writings are certainly not mandatory, they nevertheless set out the elementary security precautions corresponding to the state of the art. Therefore, the restricted committee recalls that it retains a breach of the obligations arising from Article 32 of the GDPR and not of the non-compliance with the recommendations, which moreover constitute relevant insight to assess the risks and the state of the art in terms of personal data security. 106. In addition to these recommendations, the restricted committee emphasizes that it has, on several occasions, adopted financial penalties where the characterization of a breach of article 32 of the GDPR is the result of insufficient measures to guarantee the security of the data processed. , and not only the result of the existence of a personal data breach. The deliberations n ° SAN-2019-006 of June 13, 2019 and n ° SAN-2019-007 of July 18, 2019 aim in particular at the insufficient robustness of the passwords as well as their transmission to the customers of the company by email, in clear ( readable in the body of the message), after the account has been created. 107. Under these conditions, having regard to the risks incurred by the persons mentioned above, the restricted committee considers that the aforementioned facts constitute a breach of article 32 of the GDPR as soon as the company transmits by email, in clear, the passwords of users when they subscribe to an offer from FREE MOBILE. 108. It nevertheless notes that, as part of the sanction procedure, the company attests to the mandatory implementation of the renewal of users' passwords when they first log on. The password requested by the company complies with the recommendations of the CNIL contained in its 2017 recommendation on passwords. In addition, the restricted party notes that the company undertakes to no longer transmit the passwords of new subscribers in clear by email but, from the end of March 2022, that the latter create their own password. pass, which must comply with the recommendations of the CNIL in this area. III. On corrective measures and their publicity 109. Under the terms of III of article 20 of the amended law of 6 January 1978: ""When the data controller or his subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or from this law, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms may also , if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, if necessary in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted committee for the pronouncement, after contradictory procedure, one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 2 ° An injunction to bring the processing into line with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or from this law or to meet the requests presented by the data subject in order to exercise their rights, which may be accompanied, except in cases where the processing is implemented by the State, a fine the amount of which may not exceed € 100,000 per day of delay from the date set by the restricted group; \[…\] 7 ° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the turnover. total worldwide annual business for the previous fiscal year, whichever is greater. Under the assumptions mentioned in 5 and 6 of article 83 of regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are raised, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted committee takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83. "" 110. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that ""Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the administrative fines imposed under this article for violations of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive "", before specifying the elements to be taken into account in deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the amount of this fine. 111. First, on the principle of the imposition of a fine, the company maintains that such a measure is not justified. Indeed, with regard to breaches relating to the exercise of rights of access and opposition, the company considers that the complaints underlying these breaches are of an isolated nature and, in any event, it responded to access requests and took into account the complainants' opposition requests. Regarding the breach of the obligation to protect data by design, the company considers that the processing of the telephone number corresponding to the terminated primary mobile line is necessary for the purposes of the proper performance of the mobile telephone service. Regarding the breach relating to data security, the company considers that in the absence of a personal data breach, the unencrypted transmission of user passwords is not a ""serious breach of the safety obligation "". 112. The restricted committee recalls that it must take into account, for the imposition of an administrative fine, the criteria specified in article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the violation, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and the categories of personal data affected by the breach. 113. The restricted committee considers first that the company has shown certain negligence with regard to fundamental principles of the GDPR since four breaches have been made, relating in particular to the rights of individuals and to elementary measures related to the security of personal data. The restricted panel adds that several breaches have given rise to complaints. It also emphasizes, with regard to the breach relating to data security, that the transmission by email, in clear, of the passwords of the users when they subscribe to an offer with the company FREE MOBILE, can present a risk. for the privacy of the persons concerned. 114. The restricted committee then notes that the FREE MOBILE company is a particularly important player in the telecommunications sector since, in December 2020, it had approximately \[…\] subscribers to mobile telephony offers, \[…\]. The restricted group also observes that the company, in its capacity as a mobile telephone operator, is at the heart of the routing of the daily personal data flows of many people and must therefore show particular rigor in the management of the security of the personal data concerned. 115. Finally, the restricted committee notes that the compliance measures put in place following the notification of the sanction report do not exonerate the company from its liability for the breaches noted. 116. Consequently, the restricted committee considers that an administrative fine should be imposed with regard to the breaches established in Articles 12, 15, 21, 25 and 32 of the GDPR. 117. Second, with regard to the amount of the fine, the restricted panel recalls that administrative fines must be both dissuasive and proportionate. In this case, the restricted panel noted that the complaints which gave rise to breaches appear extremely isolated and few in number - their number, seven, must be compared to the number of subscribers, \[…\] - so that these breaches can in no way be regarded as having a systemic character. The restricted training also takes into account the activity of the company and its financial situation. 118. Therefore, in view of these elements, the restricted committee considers that the imposition of a fine of 300,000 euros appears justified. 119. Thirdly, an injunction to bring the processing into line with the provisions of Articles 12, 15, 21, 25 and 32 of the GDPR was proposed by the rapporteur when the report was notified. 120. The company maintains that the actions it has taken in relation to all the breaches identified must lead to the rapporteur's proposal for an injunction not being followed up. 121. As indicated above, the restricted committee notes that the company has taken measures to bring its processing into line with the provisions of articles 12, 15, 21, 25 and 32 of the GDPR. It therefore considers that there is no longer any need to issue an injunction. 122. Lastly, with regard to the publicity of the sanction, the company maintains that such a measure would be disproportionate in view of the breaches identified and the low number of complaints referred to. It also considers that this additional publicity penalty would irreversibly damage its reputation. 123. The restricted committee considers that the publication of the sanction is justified in view of the number of breaches noted, their persistence, and the number of people concerned. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: • pronounce on FREE MOBILE an administrative fine in the amount of 300,000 (three hundred thousand) euros for breaches of Articles 12, 15, 21, 25 and 32 of the GDPR; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the company by name after the expiration of a period of two years from its publication. President Alexandre linden This decision may be appealed against to the Council of State within two months of its notification."

The Restricted Committee adopted the following decision: I. Facts and proceedings, 1. (hereinafter “the company”) is a public limited company with a Board of Directors and with share capital of located at Its main activity is the sale of furniture on the Internet and in store. 2. started its business in 2007 and has approximately employees. In 2020, it generated turnover of with a net loss of . 3. markets its products in France and several European Union countries from the website“ ” (hereinafter “the website”). It alsohas twostores inFranceowned by its subsidiary, 4. Pursuant to Decision No. 2019-084C dated 24 April 2019 of the Chairman of the Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés (hereinafter “CNIL” or “the Authority”), a CNIL team carried out an online investigation into the processing accessible from the domain on 9 May 2019, and an on-site investigation at on 5 June 2019. The purpose of these investigations was to verify the company’s compliance with all the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (hereinafter “the Regulation” or “GDPR”) and with amended Act No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 on data protection (hereinafter “the amended Act of 6 January 1978” or “the French Data Protection Act”). 5. In particular, the investigations focused on the processing of personal data of the company’s customers and prospective customers. The checks performed concerned the retention periods of the personal data, the information brought to the attention of the data subjects concerning the processing carried out by the company, compliance with data subjects’ requests for erasure of their data, the obligation to provide a legal act for the processing operations carried out on behalf of the data controller as well as the obligation to ensure data security. 6. At the end of the checks, report no. 2019-084/1 and no. 2019-084/2 were notified to in two letters dated 15 May and 11 June 2019. The company sent the Authority the additional documents requested at the end of the investigation by email on 12 June 2019. 7. By email of 22 August 2019, the company sent the investigation team several additional documents, relating in particular to the change in the company’s name, the privacy policy displayed in store or in emails sent at the time of the creation of a user account. 8. As the investigations establishedthe cross-border nature of the processing concerned, the CNIL informed all European supervisory authorities on 1 July 2020, in accordance with Article 56 of the GDPR, of its competence to act as lead supervisory authority. Seven authorities declared themselves involved in this procedure, within the meaning of Article 4 (22) of the GDPR. 9. On 5 October 2020, the CNIL Chairman submitted a draft order to the seven authorities concerned. Following this communication, the Berlin authority raised a relevant and reasoned, objection within the meaning of Article 60 of the GDPR, requesting that the draft order be transformed into a draft penalty, and more specifically an administrative fine. In support of this request, the authority concerned pointed out, in particular, the number of data subjects and the duration of the violations. 10. In order to examine these elements, the Authority’s Chairman appointed as rapporteur on 12 April 2021, pursuant to Article 39 of Decree No. 2019-536 of 29 May 2019 implementing the amended Act of 6 January 1978 (hereinafter the “Decree of 29 May 2019”). 11. At the end of his investigation, on 7 July2021, the rapporteur sent a report detailing the breaches of the GDPR that he considered to have occurred in this case and indicating to the companythat,inviewofthesummerbreak,it hadanadditionalperiodtothe onemonthinitially provided for in which to submit its written observations pursuant to the provisions of Article 40 of the Decree of 29 May 2019. It was also given a letter informing it that the case file was on the agenda of the Restricted Committee of 16 September 2021. 12. This report proposed to the Authority’s Restricted Committee to impose an injunction to make the processingcompliant with theprovisions ofArticles 5(1)(e),13, 17, 28and32 of the GDPR, accompanied by a penalty per day of delay at the end of a three-month period following notification of the Restricted Committee’s decision, as well as an administrative fine. It also proposed that this decision be made public and that the company no longer be identifiable by name upon expiry of a two-year period following its publication. 13. On 3 September 2021, the company submitted observations through its counsel. 14. The company and the rapporteur presented oral observations at the Restricted Committee’s session. II. Reasons for the decision 15. According to Article 56(1) of the Regulation “the supervisory authority of the main establishment or sole establishment of the controller or processor shall be competent to act as lead supervisory authority regarding the cross-border processing carried out by that controller or processor, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 60”. 16. In this case, the Restricted Committee found, firstly, that the company’s registered office has been in France since the creation of the company in 2007, that the company has been entered in the Trade and Companies Register in France since its inception and that it does not have any other establishment in the EU. 17. It follows from the above that the CNIL is competent to act as the lead supervisory authority for the cross-border processingimplemented bythis company, in accordance with Article 56(1) of the Regulation., 18. In accordance with the cooperation and consistency mechanism provided for in Chapter VII of the GDPR, on 1 July 2020, CNIL informed all European supervisory authorities of its competence to act as the lead supervisory authority concerning the cross-border processing carried out by the company, thus opening the notification procedure for the relevant authorities in this case. 19. The supervisory authorities of the following countries were affected by this procedure: Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. 20. Pursuant to Article 60(5) of the GDPR, the revised draft decision adopted by the restricted formation was transmitted to these supervisory authorities on 15 December 2021. 21. On 29 December 2021, none of the supervisory authorities concerned had raised any relevant and reasoned objections to the draft decision, so that, pursuant to Article 60(6) of the GDPR, they are deemed to have approved it. A. Regarding the proceedings 22. In defence, the company contests the objection made by the Berlin supervisory authority to the CNIL’s draft order, by which the authority requested the company be given an administrative fine. The company considers that it should have been the subject of an order, as initially proposed by the CNIL, and not penalty proceedings before the Restricted Committee. 23. In particular, the company expresses its surprise at the importance given to Berlin’s objection, while the sales made bythe companyin Germany only represented 3.7% of its turnover in 2020 with a German customer base of 11,168 customers. 24. The Restricted Committee notes first of all that, as part of the cooperation process set up by the GDPR, all supervisory authorities concerned within the meaning of Article 4(22) of the GDPR may issue relevant and reasoned objections to the draft decision submitted to them by the lead supervisory authority. It is then the responsibility of the lead supervisory authority to decide whether to uphold or reject the objections made, which was done in this case by the CNIL’s Chairman, in accordance with the provisions of Article 52 of Decree No. 2019-536 of 29 May 2019. 25. The Restricted Committee then notes that the criteria for determining whether a supervisory authority is concerned are set out in Article 4(22) of the GDPR and that, therefore, the turnover of a company in a Member State of the European Union or the number of customers concerned are irrelevant, provided that these criteria are met, which is the case here. 26. In addition, while indicating that the assessment of the follow-up given to the objection made by Berlin’s supervisoryauthoritywas the responsibilityof the CNIL’s Chairman, the Restricted Committee emphasises that this objection was part of the cooperation and consistency mechanism provided for in Chapter VII of the GDPR intended to ensure harmonisation of the implementation of this regulation, in particular regarding the application of supervisory authorities’ enforcement policy.,27. Finally, the RestrictedCommitteenotes that,with regardtotheobjectionrelatingto the absence of a prior order, the Conseil d’Etat ruled (EC, 9 October 2020, SERGIC, no. 433311) that it “clearly emerges \[from the provisions of Article 20 of the amended Act of 6 January 1978\], that the imposition of a penalty by the CNIL’s Restricted Committee is not subject to CNIL’s Chairman giving the data controller or its data processor a prior order. \[…\]”. 28. In light of these elements, the Restricted Committee considers that the CNIL has complied with the procedure applicable under the national provisions and the GDPR. B. Regarding the breach of the obligation to specify and comply with a personal data retention period in proportion to the purpose of the processing in accordance with Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR 29. According to Article 5(1)(e) of the Regulation, personal data must be “kept in a form which permits identificationofdata subjects for nolongerthanis necessary for thepurposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (“storage limitation”)”. 30. The rapporteur noted that during the on-site investigation of 5 June 2019, the company had indicated to the investigation team that no retention period for personal data of customers (who are according to the company the persons who have created an account and placed an order) or prospective customers (who are according to the company the persons who contact in order to obtain information on the products and services offered and who subscribe to the newsletter) had been determined or implemented by the company. The company also informed the investigation team that it did not carry out any regular deletion or archiving of such data at the end of a defined period, thereby retaining it in an active database, while its processing was no longer necessary in view of the purpose for which it was initially collected. 31. In defence, in its observations of 3 September 2021, the company firstly argued that a data retention period policy applicable to customers and prospective customers was defined from the on-site investigation on 5 June 2019, so that it could not be accused of any breach under the definition of retention periods. However, it admits that at the time of the investigation there was no functionality to determine the date of a user’s or prospective user’s last activity on their account and that this element was therefore not taken into account. 32. The company also indicated that the data of customers and prospective customers used for the purposes of marketing or managing their account was now stored in the active database until their account is deleted or, in the event of inactivity, for three years from the last time they signed into their account, their last contact with the company or their last order online or in store. At the end of those periods, the company specified that only the data necessary for pre- litigation or litigation purposes is retained and archived until the date corresponding to the statutory time limit justifying their retention, after which they would be deleted.,33. According to the Restricted Committee, with regard to the definition of retention periods applicable to the data of s customers and prospective customers, it should first be noted that on the date of the investigation of 5 June 2019, the company indicated to the investigation team that it had not determined and implemented any retention period for the personal data of customers and prospective customers. 34. The Restricted Committee then notes that the investigation team observed the presence, in an active database, of personal data of 550,645 customer accounts created since the start of the business in 2007. The company informed the investigation team that it kept in a database the personal data for 310,198 user accounts created without any order having been placed for more than three years or relating to 128,712 user accounts created but not having placed an order since 2007. 35. Therefore, whereas the Restricted Committee notes that now implements retention periods, compliance with which makes it possible to comply with the provisions of Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR – by ensuring that the data is not stored for longer than necessary in view of the purposes for which it is processed – it considers, in any event, that on the day of the investigation, the company had not defined and implemented any satisfactory retention period policy, or data deletion procedure at the end of the period for which the processing of the data was necessary and justified, or even an archiving procedure, and that it therefore kept personal data for excessive periods. 36. With regard to all of these elements, the Restricted Committee considers that the breach of Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR is established. 37. It points out, however, that the changes made by the company during the penalty proceedings enabled its compliance with the Regulations. C. Regarding the breach of the obligation to inform individuals pursuant to Article 13 of the GDPR 38. Article 13 of the GDPR requires the data controller to provide, at the time the data is collected, informationonits identityand contact details andthat of its data protectionofficer, thepurposes and legal basis of the processing, the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, information on transfers of personal data where applicable, the retention period of the personal data, the rights of individuals and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. 39. The rapporteur notes that, during the checks carried out online on 9 May 2019 and then on site on 5 June 2019, the investigation team found that the information made available to users of the website and customers, during their visit to the store, was not complete within the meaning of Article 13 of the Regulation. Certain mandatory information provided for by this Article – namely the legal bases for processing and the data retention periods – was not brought to the attention of the data subjects on the website or in store, either through the “Privacy Policy” on the website or the document entitled “Privacy and protection of personal data collected in store” placed on the store’s sales counter.,40. In its observations in defence, the company did not dispute that no information on the legal bases was made available to the data subjects in its privacy policy. However, it argued that the document entitled “Privacy and protection of personal data collected in store” placed on the store’s sales counter did not contain information on the legal bases of processing because its “purpose was togivethemain information” whilereferringtotheamendedprivacypolicymade available on the website, which constitutes additional information and is more complete. The company also argued that the lack of information related to data retention periods was only a repeat of the breach of the principle of limiting retention periods. 41. The company added that it had drafted, as part of the proceedings, a new privacy policy which now includes all the missing information, and which has been made available on the website in order to provide information that complies with the requirements of the GDPR. 42. The Restricted Committee first of all notes that, with regard to information relating to the legal bases, the company acknowledged that such information was not present in the privacy policy accessible from the website and to which the information document on data protection, located in the store, refers as stated by the investigation team. 43. The Restricted Committee also notes that, until the penalty proceedings, the data subjects were not informed of all the legal bases of the processing carried out, in breach of the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR. 44. The Restricted Committee then notes that the investigation team found, during the investigation of 5 June 2019, that the information on retention periods was not included in the privacypolicy. The company also acknowledged this specifying that the information was incomplete due to no definition and implementation of a personal data retention period policy. 45. Under such circumstances, the Restricted Committee considers that the breach of Article 13 of the GDPR is established on this point, since the information on the retention periods is among the information that must be communicated, in that it makes it possible to guarantee fair and transparent processing of the personal data concerned. Thus, for example, information on retention periods allows data subjects to know how long the data is kept by the controller and, consequently, for how long they can exercise their right of access. 46. The Restricted Committee also considers that the link between the company’s failure to implement data retention periods and the lack of information for individuals does not prevent these two breaches existing as such. 47. In light of the above, the Restricted Committeeconsiders that the companydid not complywith the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR. 48. The Restricted Committee nevertheless notes that, as part of the penalty proceedings, the company demonstrated having made its privacy policy compliant, which now contains the, notices concerning retention periods for the data processed and complete information on the legal bases of the processing, to which the information document displayed in store refers. D. Regarding the breach of the obligation to comply with requests to delete personal data pursuant to Article 17 of the GDPR 49. Under Article 17 of the GDPR, the data subject has the right to “obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall be obliged to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies: a) the personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; b) the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) (...) and where there is no other legal ground for the processing; c) the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) (...)”. 50. The rapporteur notes that during the investigation on 5 June 2019, the investigation team was informed that when an individual requests the deletion of their account, the company deactivates the account in question, preventing the individual from logging in and blocking the sending of marketing messages. The team thus noted the presence in the database of the personal data of a customer of the company who had previously made a request by email for deletion. Access to their account had simply been disabled. 51. In defence, the company first demonstrated the deletion of the data of the customer who had exercised their right to erasure of data after the CNIL’s investigation. It then stated that it had taken various measures to improve its internal procedure for managing requests to exercise rights, by centralising the receipt of requests, by putting a form for exercising rights online andbycreatingtheemail address “dp ”,dedicatedtoquestionsaboutpersonal data and managed by the company’s data protection officer. In addition, the company indicated that it had developed a document containing letter templates for responding to requests to exercise rights, including a letter for responding to requests for erasure. 52. The Restricted Committee notes that at the time of the investigation of 5 June 2019, when a request for deletion was sent to it, the company simply deactivated the account of the data subject without deleting their personal data, namely their surname, first name, email address, postal address and telephone number, which was actually observed by the CNIL’s team during the checks. 53. However, the Restricted Committee notes that when a person requests the erasure of their personal data, the data controller or its data processor must, in principle, actually delete the data once the conditions set out in Article 17 of the GDPR are met.,54. The Restricted Committee considers that whereas, after a request for deletion, certain personal data of customers may be kept in intermediate storage for specific purposes, in particular for legal obligations or evidential purposes or when the company has an overriding legitimate ground, that which is not necessary in order to comply with such obligations or purposes must be deleted after the exercise of this right, provided that the conditions laid down in Article 17 of the GDPR are met. 55. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Committee considers that the breach of Article 17 of the GDPR is established. 56. However, it notes that, as part of the penalty proceedings, the company has demonstrated having taken measures to ensure compliance with this regulation. E. Regarding the failure to provide a legal act for the processing operations carried out on behalf of the data controller pursuant to Article 28 of the GDPR 57. Article 28 of the Regulation provides that the processing carried out by a data processor on behalf of a controller is governed by a contract which defines the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data, the categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. This contract also provides for the conditions under which the data processor shall carry out the processing operations on behalf of the data controller. 58. The rapporteur notes that, regarding the relations with its processors, the company sent two quotes countersigned with whichdid not containanyof the clauses laiddown in Article 28 of the GDPR and did not provide any legal act to govern its processing relationship with . 59. In defence, the company disputes these facts, and indicates that an agreement relating to the data processing had been signed by on 17 April 2018, but that it had not been sent to the investigation team due to the inaccurate nature of its request for supporting documents made in the on-site investigation report. The company acknowledges the absence of an act to govern its relationship with . 60. The Restricted Committee notes that the data controller and the processor must enter into a contract which includes all the mandatory information laid down in Article 28 of the GDPR in order to organise their respective relationships and data protection obligations. 61. In this case, the Restricted Committee notes that the processing relationship with was governed by a legal act at the time of the investigation carried out on 5 June 2019, under the provisions of Article 28 of the GDPR. However, on the day of the investigation, the processing relationship with - which collects and records, on behalf of , customer data for the purposes of creating a customer account at the time of their visit to the store - was not governed by any legal act.,62. The Restricted Committee therefore considers that on the dayof the investigation, the breach relating to Article 28 is established as regards the processingrelationship between and due to the absence of a contract specifying in particular the data controller’s rights and obligations and the conditions under which the data processor should carry out the processing operations on behalf of the data controller. 63. It nevertheless highlights that, as part of the penalty proceedings, the company provided evidenceofaprocessingagreementsignedwith on26August 2021, which meets the requirements of Article 28 of the GDPR. F. Regarding the breach of the obligation to ensure the security of personal data pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR 64. Under Article 32 of the GDPR: “1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate: a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data; b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; d)a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing\[…\]”. 65. Firstly, the rapporteur notes that at the time of the online investigation carried out on 9 May 2019, authentication when creating a customer account on the website was based on a password composed only of a single numeric character, such as “1”, without any criteria for the complexity of the password being provided. 66. In defence, the company does not dispute these facts, but maintains that the security obligation resulting from Article 32 of the GDPR is a best efforts obligation, not a performance obligation, so the controller’s security obligation is to implement measures to reduce risks to an acceptable level, without it being compulsory, or even possible, to obtain a level of security so that the risks have no effect. The company also emphasises that the assessment of compliance with the security obligation by the controller requires consideration of the impact on the data subjects and its severity according to the categories of personal data concerned by the processing. It argues that, in the course of its business, it only collected and processed standard personal data, without any serious impact for the data subjects.,67. The Restricted Committee considers that the length and complexity of a password remain basic criteria for assessing its strength. It noted in this respect that the need for a strong password is also highlighted by ANSSI. 68. For the sake of clarity, the Restricted Committee notes that in order to ensure a sufficient level of security and satisfy the password strength requirements, when authentication relies solely on an identifier and password, the CNIL recommends, in its Decision No. 2017-012 of 19 January2017, that the password have at least twelve characters - containing at least one upper-case letter, one lower-case letter, one number and one special character - or at least eight characters - containing three of these four characters - if it is accompanied by an additional measure such as, for example, the timing of access to the account after several failures (temporary suspension of access, the duration of which increases as attempts are made), setting up a mechanism to guard against automated and multiple attempts (e.g. a “captcha”) and/or locking the account after several failed login attempts. 69. Inthis case,the RestrictedCommitteeconsiders that,in viewof the rules governingpassword composition, the strength of the passwords accepted by the company - containing one single number, such as “1”, with no criteria for the complexity of the password being provided - was too weak, risking the related accounts and personal data they contain being compromised. 70. The Restricted Committeealso considers that thelackof collectionof so-calledsensitivedata by the company, which indicates only collecting identifying or contact data, does not prevent the occurrence of malicious acts such as phishing, which is mainly based on the use of accurate and directly identifying data in order to create confusion for the user who is the subject of it. 71. In these circumstances, the Restricted Committee considers that the respondent company’s password management policy was not sufficiently robust and binding to ensure data security within the meaning of Article 32 of the GDPR. 72. However, it notes that, in the course of the penalty proceedings, the company indicated that, with regard to user accounts, it now requires a strong password comprising a minimum of twelve characters, including at least one upper-case letter, one lower-case letter, one numeric character and one special character, which was corroborated by supporting documents. 73. Secondly, the rapporteur notes that the hash function used for the storage of account passwords of customers using the website was obsolete (MD5). 74. In defence, the company does not dispute these facts. 75. The Restricted Committee emphasises that since the algorithm of this hash function is obsolete and has for a long time had well-known vulnerabilities, making it liable to be easily “broken”, this hash function no longer guarantees the integrity and confidentiality of passwords in the event of a brute force attack after compromise of the servers hosting them. Thus, the use of this algorithm would allow a person with knowledge of the hashed password, to decrypt it without difficulty in a very short time (e.g. by means of freely accessible websites that allow the value corresponding to the password hash to be retrieved). 76. In these circumstances, in view of the risks incurred by the individuals mentioned above, the Restricted Committee considers that the hash function used by the company did not make it possible to guarantee the securityof the data of its 550,000 customers, within the meaning of Article 32 of the GDPR. 77. However, it notes that, as part of the penalty proceedings, the company demonstrated having implemented a satisfactory hashing function, in BCRYPT, for all customers’ account passwords. 78. Thirdly, the rapporteur notes that the company’s employees accessed the “read/write” version of ’s database via a joint account for four employees, which is not a satisfactory measure to ensure data security. 79. In defence, the company argues that the rapporteur did not take into account the complexity of the password kept secret between the four employees authorised to access the “read/write” version of the database, nor of the authentication system based on the network addresses allowing for traceability of the access and actions of these four authorised employees. 80. The Restricted Committee notes that assigning a unique identifier per user and prohibiting shared accounts are among the essential precautions to guarantee effective traceability of access to a database. It also emphasises that the use of shared access by several people does not make it possible to accurately attribute the actions carried out on the equipment in the event of simultaneous login-in, complicating for example audits of the use of the shared account. In this sense, ANSI recommends using, by default, individual administration accounts and specifies that generic accounts on the equipment should not be used, or then exceptionally and restricted to a very limited number of administrators, since only the creation of individual accounts allows for the implementation of a relevant access control and the attribution of the actions carried out by each of the administrators. 81. In this case, the sharing of the account allowing access to the “read/write” version of the database by four employees does not make it possible to guarantee proper authentication of users and, consequently, effective management of accreditations and proper traceability of access. The Restricted Committee observes that, for example, in the event of deletion or modification of data in the database, it would be complicated to attribute responsibility to one of the four authorised individuals if several of them were connected at the same time to this generic account. 82. Therefore, such a lack of traceability of access does not allow for the identification of fraudulent access or of the individual causing the deterioration or deletion of personal data. 83. In these circumstances, the Restricted Committee considers that the use of a joint account shared by four employees does not guarantee data security within the meaning of Article 32 of the GDPR.,84. It notes, however, that the company justified, during the proceedings, having set up a single sign-on system for each user from the creation of individual accounts for access to the database in order to ensure more detailed traceability of database access. 85. In view of all the above elements, the Restricted Committee considers that the breach of Article 32 of the GDPR is established. 86. However, the Restricted Committee notes that, as part of the penalty proceedings, the company has demonstrated having taken all measures to ensure compliance with this regulation. III. Regarding corrective powers and their publication 87. Under the terms of Article 20 III of the amended Act of 6 January 1978: “When the controller or its processor fails to comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or this law, the chairman of the CNIL may also, if applicable, after sending the warning provided for in point I of this article or, where applicable,inadditionto anorderprovidedforinII,contacttheCNIL’sRestrictedCommittee with a view to the announcement, after adversarial proceedings, of one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 2. An injunction to make the processing compliant with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or this law or to comply with the requests made by the data subject to exercise their rights, which may be accompanied, except in cases where the processing is implemented by the State, with a penalty fine not exceeding 100,000 euros per day of delay from the date fixed by the Restricted Committee; \[…\] 7. With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine may not exceed 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the total annual global turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is the greater. In the cases mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, these upper limits shall be increased, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of the turnover. In determining the amount of the fine, the Restricted Committee shall take into account the criteria specified in the same Article 83.” 88. Article 83 of the GDPR states that “Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article in respect of infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive”, before specifying the elements to be taken into account when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and when deciding on the amount of that fine. 89. Firstly, on the principle of imposing a fine, the company maintains that such a measure is not justified. The company asserts that it has complied with its legal obligations and that it, has cooperated with the CNIL in a diligent manner and in good faith since the start of the proceedings. It therefore argues that imposing an administrative fine would go against the principles of the need for penalties and proportionality. It points out in particular that it has never been penalised by the Restricted Committee, that the aforementioned breaches do not inanywayconstituteadeliberatebreachoftheGDPR,thatthedatasubjectshavenotsuffered any damage, and that no specific data referred to in Articles 9 and 10 of the GDPR is concerned. 90. The Restricted Committee notes that, in imposing an administrative fine, it must take into account the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and the categories of personal data concerned by the infringement. 91. Firstly, the Restricted Committee notes that the company has demonstrated significant negligence with regard to the fundamental principles of the GDPR, since five breaches have been established, in particular concerning the principle of limiting the data retention period, the obligation to inform data subjects of the processing of their personal data and the obligation to respect their rights. 92. The Restricted Committee then notes that at least some breaches have been established over a period of several years and have affected a large number of people, almost 550,000 individuals, established in France and in six other Member States of the European Union. 93. The Restricted Committee also notes that, within the framework of the penalty proceedings, thecompany’scooperationwith thesupervisoryauthoritymeetstheobligationofcooperation laid down in Articles 31 of the GDPR and 18 of the Act and cannot constitute a level of cooperation exceeding that which is reasonably expected. Therefore, the company’s cooperation with the CNIL as part of the penalty proceedings cannot be considered as an extenuating circumstance when imposing an administrative fine. 94. In addition, the Restricted Committee notes that whereas the company only processes standard personal data, it is still required to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to ensure a level of security for this data appropriate to the risk, in accordance with Article 32 of the GDPR and in accordance with the principles set out in Article 5 of the GDPR. 95. Finally, the Restricted Committee notes that compliance measures were only put in place by the company following the penalty proceedings and that they did not exempt it from its responsibility for the past. 96. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that an administrative fine should be imposed in view of the breaches of Articles 5(1)(e), 13, 17, 28 and 32 of the GDPR., 97. Secondly, with regard to the amount of the fine, the company considers that the amount of the fine proposed by the rapporteur is disproportionate in view of its economic situation. It highlights its poor financial situation and specifies that a high fine would have a significant impact on its business and economic development, particularly in terms of job creation. 98. TheRestrictedCommitteenotesthatArticle83(3) oftheRegulationprovidesthatintheevent of multiple breaches, as in the case in point, the total amount of the fine may not exceed the amount set for the most serious breach. Insofar as the company is alleged to be in breach of Articles 5(1)(e), 13, 17, 28 and 32 of the GDPR, the maximum fine that can be imposed is 20 million euros or 4% of annual worldwide turnover, whichever is higher. 99. The Restricted Committee also notes that administrative fines must be dissuasive but proportionate. In particular, it considers that the company’s activity and financial situation must be taken into account when determining the penalty and, in particular, in the case of an administrative fine, its amount. In this regard, it notes that the company reports turnover in 2019 and 2020 of approximately23 million euros, then approximately30 million euros, with a net loss of -932,078 euros and then -1.7 million euros, respectively. 100. In view of this information, the Restricted Committee considers that imposing a fine of 120,000 euros seems justified for the breaches of Articles 5(1)(e), 13, 17, 28 and 32 of the GDPR. 101. Thirdly, an injunction to make the processing compliant with the provisions of Articles 5(1)(e), 13, 17, 28 and 32 of the GDPR was proposed by the rapporteur when the report was notified. 102. The company argues that the actions it has taken in relation to all the breaches identified should lead to no further action in respect of the Rapporteur’s proposed injunction. 103. The Restricted Committee considers that the company has taken the necessary measures to ensure compliance. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that there are no longer grounds to impose an injunction for these points. FOR THESE REASONS The CNIL’s Restricted Committee after having deliberated, intends to:  impose an administrative fine against for an amount of 120,000 (one hundred and twenty thousand) euros in respect of the breaches of Articles 5(1)(e), 13, 17, 28 and 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016.,This decision may be appealed before the French Conseil d’Etat within two months of its notification."

Facts and procedure 1. GOOGLE LLC is a limited liability company headquartered in the United States. Since its creation in 1998, it has developed numerous services for individuals and businesses, such as the Google Search search engine, Gmail email, the Google Maps mapping service and the YouTube video platform. It has more than 70 offices in some fifty countries and employs more than 135,000 people around the world. Since August 2015, GOOGLE LLC has been a wholly-owned subsidiary of ALPHABET Inc., parent company of the GOOGLE group. 2. In 2020, ALPHABET Inc. had revenue of over $182 billion, while GOOGLE LLC had revenue of $182 billion. The Google Search search engine generated more than $104 billion in revenue, while advertising through GOOGLE Group services generated nearly $147 billion in revenue, and through YouTube services nearly $20 billion. billion. 3. GOOGLE IRELAND LIMITED (hereinafter ""GIL"") presents itself as the headquarters of the GOOGLE group for its activities in the European Economic Area and in Switzerland. Based in Dublin (Ireland), it employs approximately \[…\] people. It achieved a turnover of \[…\] euros in 2019. 4. GOOGLE FRANCE SARL is the French establishment of the GOOGLE group. A wholly-owned subsidiary of GOOGLE LLC, its head office is located in Paris. It employs approximately \[…\] employees and achieved a turnover of \[…\] euros in 2019. 5. On March 16, 2020, as part of a previous procedure brought against the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL, a delegation from the National Commission for Computing and Liberties (hereinafter ""the CNIL"" or "" the Commission"") carried out an online check on the ""google.fr"" website. The purpose of this mission was in particular to verify compliance, by the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL, with the provisions of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter "" the Data Protection Act "") and in particular its article 82. 6. Pursuant to Article 22 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law, the President of the CNIL appointed a rapporteur on June 8, 2020. 7. By deliberation no. SAN-2020-012 of December 7, 2020, the Restricted Committee: - imposed administrative fines on GOOGLE LLC and GIL in the respective amounts of 60 million and 40 million euros for breach of Article 82 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law; - pronounced against the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL ""an injunction to bring the processing into compliance with the obligations resulting from article 82 of the law ""computing and freedoms"", in particular: o inform the persons concerned beforehand in a clear and complete manner, for example on the information banner on the home page of the ""google.fr"" site: - the purposes of all cookies subject to consent, - the means at their disposal to refuse them”; - accompanied by the injunction of a penalty payment of 100,000 euros per day of delay at the end of a period of three months following the notification of this deliberation; - made public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the companies by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. 8. On January 29, 2021, the companies filed a summary appeal before the Council of State, requesting the suspension of the injunction. This request was rejected by a decision of March 4, 2021 (CE, judge in chambers, March 4, 2021, No. 449212). 9. At the same time, the companies filed a full litigation appeal against the deliberation of December 7, 2020. The procedure is still pending before the Council of State. 10. By deliberation no. SAN-2021-004 of April 30, 2021, the Restricted Committee considered that the companies had complied with the injunction within the time limit, insofar as ""people visiting the site"" google. fr ""are now informed, in a clear and complete manner, of all the purposes of cookies subject to consent and the means available to them to refuse them, through the information banner displayed when they arrive on the site"" . 11. On March 18, March 31, April 2 and April 28, 2021, the CNIL received several complaints denouncing the procedures for refusing cookies from the ""google.fr"" and ""youtube.com"" websites made available to users located in France. 12. Pursuant to Decision No. 2021-108C of May 20, 2021 of the President of the Commission, the CNIL services carried out an online check, on June 1, 2021, on the ""google.fr"" websites and ""youtube.com"". 13. The purpose of this mission was in particular to verify compliance, by the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL (hereinafter the ""companies""), with the provisions of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law. 14. In the context of online monitoring, the delegation made observations when the user visits the ""google.fr"" and ""youtube.com"" sites; when he clicks on the ""Customize"" button; when he clicks on the ""Privacy Policy"" link and when he clicks on ""Terms of Use"". 15. On June 3, 2021, the delegation notified the companies of the report drawn up as part of the online control, asking them to indicate, for each of the cookies mentioned in the said report, its purpose and to provide a volume of the number of unique daily visitors for the “google.fr” and “youtube.com” sites over the last twelve months from France. 16. On June 21 and July 9, 2021, the CNIL received two new complaints denouncing the procedures for refusing cookies from the ""google.fr"" website. 17. By letter dated July 9, 2021, the company GIL responded to the delegation's request, indicating that it was providing an answer ""without prejudice to \[its\] rights under the GDPR, in particular the one-stop-shop mechanism and the role of lead authority of the Irish Data Protection Commission (“DPC“) in investigations”. She specified that she acted as the person responsible for processing personal data with regard to the cookies deployed on the ""google.fr"" and ""youtube.com"" domains for users located within the European Economic Area and in Switzerland. . It also transmitted the purpose of each of the cookies placed on the user's terminal and identified in the report of findings. On the other hand, it refused to provide the volume of the number of unique visitors to these two websites over the past twelve months from France, considering that it was not necessary to provide this information at this stage. 18. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission appointed Mrs Valérie PEUGEOT as rapporteur, on July 28, 2021, on the basis of Article 22 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law. 19. At the end of her investigation, the rapporteur served by hand, on September 2, 2021, on the companies' councils and by e-mail on their representatives, a report detailing the breach of Article 82 of the law "" Informatique et Libertés"" which it considered constituted in this case. 20. This report proposed that the restricted committee of the Commission impose an administrative fine on the two companies, as well as an injunction to bring into compliance the processing consisting of operations of reading and/or writing of information in the terminal of users located in France, on the “google.fr” and “youtube.com” websites, with the provisions of article 82 of the “Informatique et Libertés” law, accompanied by a penalty payment. It also proposed that this decision be made public and no longer allow companies to be identified by name after the expiry of a period of two years from its publication. 21. By letter dated September 9, 2021, the companies, through their counsel, requested additional time to provide their observations in response. By letter dated September 15, 2021, the chairman of the Restricted Committee granted them additional time until October 8, 2021. 22. By letter dated September 27, 2021 addressed to the Chairman of the Restricted Committee, the companies, through their counsel, requested the suspension of the procedure pending the decision of the Council of State within the framework of the appeal brought against deliberation no. SAN-2020-012 of December 7, 2020. On September 30, 2021, the company boards informed the chairman of the restricted formation of the creation of a working group by the European Protection Committee (hereinafter ""the EDPS""), intended to coordinate the response to complaints relating to cookie banners, filed by the None of Your Business association (hereinafter ""the NOYB association"") with various protection authorities European data. 23. By letter dated October 4, 2021, the chairman of the Restricted Committee rejected the companies' request for a stay of proceedings. 24. On October 8, 2021, the companies filed submissions in response to the sanction report. 25. The rapporteur replied to the companies' observations on 22 October 2021. 26. On October 27, 2021, through their advisers, the companies requested an extension of the fifteen-day period provided for in Article 40 of Decree No. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 to file their observations. in response, a request to postpone the restricted committee meeting set for November 25, 2021 and a request for the meeting to be held behind closed doors. 27. On October 29, 2021, the chairman of the Restricted Committee granted an additional period of eight days to the companies to produce their second observations and refused to postpone the date of the Restricted Committee meeting and to hold the said meeting in camera . 28. On November 12, 2021, the companies submitted new observations in response to those of the rapporteur. 29. The companies and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the session of the Restricted Committee. II. Reasons for decision A. On the request for a stay of proceedings 30. The companies request that the restricted committee stay its ruling pending the decision to be rendered by the Council of State in the context of the appeal lodged against deliberation no. SAN-2020-012 of 7 December 2020 and pending the conclusions of the new EDPS working group mentioned above. They base their request on Article 66 of the CNIL's internal regulations and on the principle of the proper administration of justice. The companies argue in particular that they are asking the Council of State to rule on several pleas which will have direct and decisive consequences on the present sanction procedure. They argue in particular before the Council of State that the CNIL was not competent to pronounce administrative sanctions against them, whereas moreover the legal framework applicable to cookies was not yet consolidated and that the sanctions imposed are manifestly unjustified and disproportionate. 31. Firstly, the Restricted Committee observes that Article 66 of the CNIL's internal regulations provides that ""The meetings of the Restricted Committee are chaired by its chairman or, in the event of impediment, by its vice-chairman. chairman of the meeting directs the debates and ensures the policing of the meeting. He can order any suspension that he deems useful"". The suspension referred to in the context of this article does not concern the suspension of the sanction procedure, but concerns the suspension of the session of the Restricted Committee. 32. Secondly, the companies have already put forward these same arguments to the chairman of the Restricted Committee in their letter of September 27, 2021, who refused to grant the request for suspension by letter of October 4, considering that the decision to initiate a sanction procedure belongs to the President of the Commission and that it does not fall within the powers of the President of the Restricted Committee to order its suspension. The president of the restricted training also recalled in this letter that in application of article L. 4 of the code of administrative justice, the request for annulment filed against the deliberation of the restricted training of December 7, 2020 before the Council of State has no suspensive effect and, moreover, the date on which this court will examine this file was not known. Finally, he added that the creation of a working group within the EDPS was not, in any event, such as to justify a suspension of the sanction procedure. 33. Thirdly, the Council of State's decision may not be taken for several months. 34. Finally, with regard to the creation of the working group by the EDPS on cookie banners, the Restricted Committee notes that the outcome of this work is not known to date. 35. The Restricted Committee therefore considers that there is no need to stay proceedings. B. Complaint alleging breach of the non bis in idem principle 36. The companies argue that the Restricted Committee cannot rule again on the same facts as those concerned by deliberations no. SAN-2020-012 of December 7, 2020 and no. SAN-2021-004 of April 30, 2021, without violating the non bis in idem principle. They argue that the parties concerned by this procedure and the previous deliberations mentioned above are identical, that the two procedures concern the same facts and that a final decision, deliberation no. SAN-2021-004 of April 30, 2021, has been reached. 37. Firstly, the Restricted Committee notes that, in its deliberation No. SAN-2020-012 of December 7, 2020, it found a breach of Article 82 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law given the lack of informing people, the failure to collect people's consent before the cookies are placed on their terminal and the partially defective nature of the ""opposition"" mechanism put in place by Google. It also issued an injunction against them ""to bring the processing into conformity with the obligations resulting from article 82 of the law"" data processing and freedoms "", in particular: o Inform the persons concerned beforehand in a clear and complete manner, for example on the information banner on the home page of the ""google.fr"" site: - the purposes of all cookies subject to consent, - the means at their disposal to refuse them"". 38. The Restricted Committee thus notes that the first procedure that led to the aforementioned deliberation included an injunction relating to the information of users on the purposes of cookies subject to consent and on the means of refusing cookies. The current procedure concerns the refusal procedures themselves, and not only the information. Thus, the two procedures do not concern the same facts. 39. Secondly, the companies argue that, under the terms of deliberation no. SAN-2020-012 of December 7, 2020, the restricted committee ordered them to comply with article 82 of the law ""Informatique et Libertés "" in all its provisions and to provide in particular, but not exclusively because of the use of the terms "" in particular "", information on the purposes of cookies and on the means of opposing them. They add that, by deliberation no. SAN-2021-004 of April 30, 2021, the restricted committee would have decided that the mechanism for consenting and rejecting cookies, in its entirety, complied with article 82 of the law. Informatique et Libertés"" and that the companies would have complied with the injunction within the time limit. 40. The Restricted Committee does not subscribe to this analysis. The sanction report of the previous procedure only related to the information put in place by the companies on the cookie banner, on the deposit of cookies without consent and on the partial failure of the ""opposition"" mechanism. There is therefore no doubt that the Restricted Committee was unable to rule on what was not before it in the context of the adversarial procedure. Thus, if the words ""in particular"" can cause confusion, when the formula is taken in isolation, the Restricted Committee recalls that this injunction cannot be read in a manner unrelated to the whole of the corresponding decision. However, in the context of this previous procedure, the Restricted Committee only ruled on the aforementioned scope and the injunction was only issued in connection with the information of persons. The procedures for refusing read and/or write operations, which are the subject of this sanction procedure, did not fall within the scope of this injunction. Since deliberation no. SAN-2021-004 of April 30, 2021 must necessarily be read in the light of deliberation no. SAN-2020-012 of December 7, 2020, it cannot be considered that the injunction issued related to all obligations resulting from article 82 of the law ""Informatique et Libertés"". 41. In this respect, the Restricted Committee notes that, in two letters dated February 17, 2021 addressed to the companies, the Secretary General of the CNIL recalled that, as is apparent from the reasons and the operative part of deliberation No. SAN-2020- 012 of December 7, 2020, the compliance expected in the context of the injunction procedure related only to the information provided to people on the home page of the ""google.fr"" site. It was also stated that, with regard to the obligation to inform the persons concerned in a clear and complete manner of the means available to them to refuse cookies, ""this question is difficult to separate from the question of the methods of refusal on the first level, by a refuse button or an equivalent solution, which is not within the scope of the injunction"". From a support perspective – and in view of the developments expected under the entry into force of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (hereinafter “the Regulation” or “the GDPR ""), informed by the recommendation of September 17, 2020, and for which an adaptation period had been left by the CNIL to the actors until April 1, 2021 - the letter included an analysis exceeding the scope of the injunction issued by the restricted committee, which focused on the elements provided by the companies in response to the injunction, elements which themselves went beyond the scope of the deliberation mechanism. In this context, the companies were reminded that it must be as easy to give their consent as to refuse to give or withdraw it and they were told that it would be up to them to insert on the information banner a ""I refuse"" button next to the ""I accept"" button, while specifying that they could ""of course change the titles of these buttons as long as they allow the user to understand clearly and directly the consequences of their choices "". If this letter has no binding value, the Restricted Committee notes that under the terms of a letter that GIL sent to the Chairman of the Restricted Committee on March 30, 2021, the company had replied: ""we share the analysis of the services of the CNIL that Google's consent mechanism does not fall within the scope of the injunction issued by the Restricted Committee in its deliberation of December 7, 2020"". 42. Consequently, the companies cannot affirm that the Restricted Committee validated the new cookie banner put in place by them following the first sanction procedure, even though they themselves were fully aware that the mechanism of consent and rejection of cookies, in its entirety, was not the subject of this previous procedure and that the CNIL recalled on various occasions that it did not rule on this point within the framework of the previous procedure. 43. The Restricted Committee notes that, in its press release relating to the closure of the injunction of May 4, 2021, the CNIL had also taken care to specify that: ""Seizure before the end of the adaptation period left to actors by the CNIL, the Restricted Committee did not examine the compliance of the information banner provided on the ""google.fr"" site with the new rules on cookies, relating in particular to consent, which are highlighted by the lines guidelines and the recommendation of September 17, 2020. This closing decision therefore does not prejudge the CNIL's analysis of google.fr's compliance with these requirements, according to which the user must now be able to refuse cookies. as easily as he can accept them. The CNIL now reserves the right to control these refusal procedures and, if necessary, to mobilize its entire repressive chain"". 44. Lastly, the Restricted Committee notes that the present procedure concerns both the ""google.fr"" and ""youtube.com"" websites, whereas the previous procedure only concerned the ""google.fr"" website. 45. The Restricted Committee therefore considers that the complaint alleging breach of the non bis in idem principle must be dismissed. C. On the competence of the CNIL 1. On the material competence of the CNIL and the non-application of the ""one-stop shop"" mechanism provided for by the GDPR 46. The processing operations subject to the control carried out on June 1, 2021 by a delegation from the CNIL are carried out in the context of the provision of electronic communications services accessible to the public through a public electronic communications network offered within the 'European Union. As such, they fall within the material scope of the ""ePrivacy"" directive. 47. Article 5(3) of that directive, relating to the storage of or access to information already stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user, was transposed into national law at the article 82 of the law ""Informatique et Libertés"", within chapter IV of the law relating to the Rights and obligations specific to processing in the electronic communications sector. 48. Under the terms of article 16 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law, ""the restricted committee takes measures and pronounces sanctions against data controllers or subcontractors who do not comply with the obligations arising \[ …\] of this law"". Under Article 20, paragraph III, of this same law, ""when the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from \[…\] this law, the president of the National Commission for Computing and freedoms \[…\] can seize the restricted formation "". 49. The rapporteur considers that the CNIL is materially competent pursuant to these provisions to control and sanction the operations of access or registration of information implemented by companies in the terminals of users of the ""google.fr"" sites. and ""youtube.com"" in France. 50. The companies contest the competence of the CNIL and believe that they should be subject to the procedural framework provided for by the GDPR, i.e. the mechanism for cooperation between the supervisory authorities, known as the ""one-stop shop"" mechanism "", provided for in Chapter VII of the Regulations. Pursuant to this mechanism, the supervisory authority competent to know the facts in question would not be the CNIL but the Irish data protection authority, the Data Protection Commissioner (hereinafter the ""DPC""), which would have to act as the lead authority with regard to the deployment of cookies, which is competent according to the companies both under the GDPR and the ""ePrivacy"" directive. 51. In this support, the companies invoke in particular the inextricable link between the GDPR and the “ePrivacy” directive, considering that the application of the GDPR cannot be excluded when article 82 of the “Informatique et Libertés” law applies. . They also invoke the principle of lex specialis – lex generalis under which, in their view, the ""ePrivacy"" directive clarifies and complements the GDPR. The companies consider that the absence of specific rules relating to the determination of the jurisdiction of the supervisory authority in the event of cross-border processing falling within the scope of the ""ePrivacy"" directive should be supplemented by the application of the framework procedural under the GDPR. They argue that the application of the ""one-stop-shop"" mechanism is not only in line with the intention of the European legislator, but also with the interpretation of the EDPS, and moreover corresponds to the position adopted by several European authorities. They point out in this respect that the power left to the Member States as to the choice of the national authority responsible for ensuring compliance with the ""ePrivacy"" directive does not preclude the application of the ""one-stop shop"" mechanism provided for by the GDPR. , to the extent that cooperation agreements between these authorities have been concluded in several Member States so that the data protection authorities and the authorities responsible for the application of the ""ePrivacy"" Directive, if it concerns different authorities, can jointly exercise enforcement powers on a matter falling within the scope of the GDPR and the ""ePrivacy"" directive and thus participate in the one-stop-shop mechanism. 52. The companies further add that the EDPS announcement of 27 September 2021 relating to the creation of a working group on cookie banners in response to the significant number of complaints recently lodged with the supervisory authorities by the association NOYB constitutes evidence that the EDPS considers that cookie-related breaches fall directly within the scope of the GDPR and, therefore, within the ""one-stop-shop"" mechanism. 53. As a preliminary point, the Restricted Committee emphasizes the distinction that should be made between, on the one hand, the operations consisting in depositing and reading a cookie on a user's terminal and, on the other hand, the subsequent use that is made of the data generated by these cookies, for example for profiling purposes, generally referred to as ""subsequent processing"" (also called ""subsequent""). Each of these two successive stages is subject to a different legal regime: while the operations of reading and writing in a terminal are governed by special rules, set by the ""ePrivacy"" directive - in this case, by its article 5 paragraph 3 -, and transposed into national law, ""subsequent processing"" is governed by the GDPR and, as such, may be subject to the ""one-stop shop"" mechanism in the event that it is cross-border. 54. In the present case, the Restricted Committee recalls that this procedure only covers the read and write operations implemented in the terminal of the user located in France visiting the search engine Google Search and YouTube , the material findings made by the delegation during the online check of June 1, 2021 having focused only on these operations, without being interested in the subsequent processing implemented from the data collected via these cookies. 55. Firstly, the Restricted Committee notes that it is clear from the provisions cited above that the French legislator has instructed the CNIL to ensure compliance with the provisions of the ""ePrivacy"" directive transposed into Article 82 of the law "" Computing and Freedoms "", in particular by entrusting it with the power to sanction any ignorance of this article. It emphasizes that this competence was recognized in particular by the Council of State in its decision Association of communication consulting agencies of June 19, 2020 concerning the deliberation of the CNIL no 2019-093 adopting guidelines relating to the application of article 82 of the law of January 6, 1978 amended to read or write operations in a user's terminal. The Council of State has indeed noted that ""article 20 of this law entrusts \[to\] the president \[of the CNIL\] the power to take corrective measures in the event of non-compliance with the obligations resulting from regulation (EU) 2016 /279 or of its own provisions, as well as the possibility of seizing the restricted formation with a view to imposing the sanctions likely to be pronounced ""(CE, June 19, 2020, req. 434684, pt. 3). 56. Secondly, the Restricted Committee considers that when processing may fall within both the material scope of the ""ePrivacy"" Directive and the material scope of the GDPR, reference should be made to the relevant provisions of the two texts which provide for their articulation. Thus, article 1, paragraph 2, of the ""ePrivacy"" directive provides that ""the provisions of this directive specify and supplement Directive 95/46/EC"" of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of personal data (hereinafter ""Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data""), it being recalled that since the entry into force of the Regulation, references made to the latter directive must be understood as made to the GDPR , in accordance with Article 94 of the latter. Similarly, it appears from recital 173 of the GDPR that this text explicitly provides that it is not applicable to the processing of personal data ""subject to specific obligations having the same objective \[of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms\] set out in the Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, including the obligations of the controller and the rights of natural persons"". This articulation was confirmed by the CJEU in its Planet49 decision of October 1, 2019 (CJEU, October 1, 2019, C 673/17, pt. 42). 57. In this respect, the Restricted Committee notes that, contrary to what the companies maintain, the ""ePrivacy"" directive constitutes a body of special rules, which does provide, for the specific obligations it entails, its own mechanism for implementation and control of its application within its article 15bis. Thus, the first paragraph of this article leaves the Member States the power to determine ""the system of penalties, including criminal penalties where appropriate, applicable to breaches of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and \[to take \] any measure necessary to ensure their implementation. The penalties thus provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and may be applied to cover the duration of the infringement, even if it has subsequently been corrected"". The rule laid down in 3) of article 5 of the ""ePrivacy"" directive, according to which the read and/or write operations must systematically be the subject of the prior agreement of the user, after information, constitutes a special rule with regard to the GDPR since it prohibits relying on the legal bases mentioned in Article 6 of the latter in order to be able to lawfully carry out these read and/or write operations on the terminal. The control of this rule therefore falls under the special control and sanction mechanism provided for by the ""ePrivacy"" directive, and not the data protection authorities and the EDPS in application of the GDPR. It is by a specific choice that the legislator in France entrusted this mission to the CNIL. In addition, the second paragraph of the same article obliges Member States to ensure ""that the competent national authority and, where appropriate, other national bodies have the power to order the cessation of the infringements referred to in paragraph I"" . 58. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Committee considers that, in application of the adage specialia generalibus derogant, the specific rules relating to cookies resulting from the ""ePrivacy"" directive prevail over the general rules of the GDPR. Thus, the ""one-stop-shop"" mechanism provided for by the GDPR cannot be applied to the processing covered by the directive, as the companies claim. 59. Thirdly, the Restricted Committee adds that this exclusion is corroborated by the fact that the Member States, which are free to determine the national authority competent to hear violations of the national provisions adopted pursuant to the ""ePrivacy"" Directive, may have assigned this competence to an authority other than their national data protection authority established by the GDPR, in this case to their telecommunications regulatory authority. Consequently, insofar as these latter authorities are not part of the EDPS, while this committee plays an essential role in the consistency control mechanism implemented in Chapter VII of the GDPR, it is in fact impossible to apply the ""one-stop shop"" to practices likely to be penalized by national supervisory authorities not sitting on this committee. 60. The Restricted Committee points out that the cooperation agreements entered into between data protection authorities and telecommunications regulatory authorities in certain Member States, relied on by the company, are intended to establish cooperation at national level between the various regulators in order to to ensure the consistency of their doctrines on related subjects but do not aim to involve the telecommunications regulatory authorities as such in the ""one-stop shop"" mechanism provided for in Chapter VII of the GDPR. 61. Fourthly, the Restricted Committee notes that the EDPS, in his Opinion No. 5/2019 of 12 March 2019 on the interactions between the ""privacy and electronic communications"" directive and the GDPR, explicitly excluded ""one-stop shop"" mechanism to matters materially falling under the ""ePrivacy"" directive in these terms: ""in accordance with Chapter VII of the GDPR, the cooperation and consistency mechanisms available to data protection authorities under the GDPR concern the monitoring the application of the provisions of the GDPR.The mechanisms of the GDPR do not apply to monitoring the application of the provisions of the ""privacy and electronic communications"" directive as such"" (EDPS, opinion 5/2019, March 12, 2019, pt. 80). 62. Fifthly, the Restricted Committee notes that the CJEU, in a Facebook Belgium judgment delivered on June 15, 2021, took up the aforementioned Opinion 5/2019 of the EDPS. The CJEU followed on this point the conclusions of its Advocate General, Mr BOBEK, who considered that ""in order to decide whether a case actually falls within the material scope of the GDPR, a national court, including any referring court , is obliged to seek the precise source of the legal obligation weighing on an economic operator which he is alleged to have breached. If the source of this obligation is not the GDPR, the procedures established by this instrument, which are linked to its main objective, are logically not applicable either” (CJEU, conclusions of Advocate General M. BOBEK, 13 January 2021, Facebook Belgium, C 645/19, pts. 37 and 38). 63. In this case, the Restricted Committee notes that, in the present proceedings, the precise source of the legal obligation subject of the control originates in Article 5, paragraph 3, of the ""ePrivacy"" Directive, transposed to Article 82 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law, informed by the conditions of consent as provided for by the GDPR, Article 2, f), of the ""ePrivacy"" directive providing that the consent of a user corresponds to the consent of the data subject contained in Directive 95/46/EC, which has been replaced by the GDPR. 64. The Restricted Committee also points out that other national data protection authorities have also already imposed sanctions relating to breaches relating to the operations of reading and/or writing information in the user's terminal. The Spanish authority has thus issued several sanction decisions against various data controllers in exclusive application of the national provisions transposing the ""ePrivacy"" directive, in this case article 22, paragraph 2 of Ley 34/2002 of July 11 of Servicios de la Sociedad de la Información y de Comercio Electrónico, without implementing the cooperation procedure established by the GDPR. 65. Sixthly, the Restricted Committee notes that the possible application of the ""one-stop shop"" mechanism to processing governed by the ""ePrivacy"" directive is the subject of numerous discussions in the context of the draft regulation ""ePrivacy"" under negotiation for more than four years at European level. The very existence of these debates confirms that, as it stands, the one-stop-shop mechanism provided for by the GDPR is not applicable to matters governed by the current ""ePrivacy"" directive. 66. Lastly, according to the Restricted Committee, the creation of a working group on cookie banners in response to the large number of complaints lodged with the European supervisory authorities by the NOYB association does not mean, contrary to what is argued, that the EDPS considers that all cookie-related breaches necessarily fall within the scope of the GDPR. The Restricted Committee also notes that some of the issues raised in these complaints relate to subsequent processing, which falls under the GDPR. In addition, pursuant to Article 70(1)(u), the EDPS has the task, inter alia, of promoting cooperation and the effective bilateral and multilateral exchange of information and best practices between supervisory authorities. The purpose of the working group is thus to discuss the analysis of the numerous complaints filed by the NOYB association. The creation of this working group does not call into question the position of the EDPS, in his opinion 5/2019 mentioned above. 67. Thus, the Restricted Committee considers that the ""one-stop shop"" mechanism provided for by the GDPR is not applicable to this procedure and that the CNIL is competent to control and sanction processing operations consisting of reading and/or write information in the terminal of users located in France implemented by companies falling within the scope of the ""ePrivacy"" directive, provided that they relate to its territorial jurisdiction. 2. On the territorial jurisdiction of the CNIL 68. The rule of territorial application of the requirements set out in article 82 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law is set out in article 3, paragraph I, of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law which provides: ""without prejudice, with regard to the processing falling within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, of the criteria provided for in Article 3 of this regulation, all the provisions of this law apply to the processing of personal data carried out within the framework of the activities of an establishment of a data controller \[…\] on French territory, whether or not the processing takes place in France”. 69. The rapporteur considers that the CNIL has territorial jurisdiction pursuant to these provisions when the processing covered by this procedure, consisting of operations to access or register information in the terminal of users residing in France during the use of the Google Search search engine and YouTube, in particular for advertising purposes, is carried out within the ""framework of the activities"" of the company GOOGLE FRANCE, which constitutes the ""establishment"" on French territory of the GOOGLE group. 70. The companies, for their part, refer on this point to the observations they had produced in the context of the previous sanction procedure and in which they maintained that, insofar as it would be appropriate to apply the rules of jurisdiction and of the cooperation procedures defined by the GDPR, the CNIL would not have territorial jurisdiction to hear this case given that the ""real headquarters"" of the GOOGLE group in Europe, i.e. the place of its central administration within the meaning of Article 56 GDPR, is located in Ireland. 71. The Restricted Committee again holds that the facts in question fall materially under the provisions of the ""ePrivacy"" directive, and not the GDPR. As a result, reference should be made to the provisions of Article 3, paragraph I, of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law, determining the scope of the territorial jurisdiction of the CNIL. 72. In this respect, the Restricted Committee points out that the ""ePrivacy"" Directive does not itself explicitly set the rule of territorial application of the various transposition laws adopted by each Member State. However, this directive indicates that it ""clarifies and completes Directive 95/46.EC"", which provided at the time, in its Article 4, that ""Each Member State shall apply the national provisions which it adopts pursuant to this Directive to the processing of personal data when: (a) the processing is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller in the territory of the Member State; if the same controller is established in the territory of several Member States, it must take the necessary measures to ensure that each of its establishments complies with the obligations provided for by the applicable national law"". If this rule for determining the national law applicable within the Union is no longer relevant for the application of the rules of the GDPR, which replaced Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data and applies uniformly throughout the territory of the Union, it appears that the French legislator has maintained these criteria of territorial application for the specific rules contained in the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law, and therefore in this case for those which transpose the ""ePrivacy"" directive. Therefore, the case law of the CJEU on the application of Article 4 of the former Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data remains relevant to clarify the scope to be given to these two criteria. 73. Firstly, with regard to the existence of an ""establishment of the controller on French territory"", the CJEU has consistently held that the concept of establishment should be assessed in a flexible manner and that to this end, it was necessary to assess both the degree of stability of the installation and the reality of the pursuit of activities in another Member State, taking into account the specific nature of the economic activities and the provision of services in question (see, for example, CJEU, Weltimmo, 1 Oct. 2015, C 230/14, pts. 30 and 31). The CJEU also considers that a company, an autonomous legal person, from the same group as the controller, can constitute an establishment of the controller within the meaning of these provisions (CJEU, 13 May 2014, Google Spain, C-131/ 12, point 48). 74. In this case, the Restricted Committee notes, first of all, that the company GOOGLE FRANCE is the headquarters of the French subsidiary of the company GOOGLE LLC, that it has premises located in Paris, that it employs approximately \[…\] persons and that, according to its articles of association filed with the Registry of the Paris Commercial Court, its purpose is in particular “the provision of services and/or advice relating to software, the Internet network, telematic or online networks, including intermediation in the sale of online advertising, the promotion in all its forms of online advertising, the direct promotion of products and services and the implementation of information processing centers"". The Restricted Committee then notes, as it recalled in its deliberation of December 7, 2020, ""that the company GOOGLE FRANCE is responsible for ensuring the promotion of online advertising on behalf of the company GIL, which is co-contractor of the advertising contracts concluded with French companies or French subsidiaries of foreign companies ""and"" that the company GOOGLE FRANCE participates effectively in the promotion of products and services designed and developed by the company GOOGLE LLC, such as Google Search , in France, as well as to the advertising activities managed by the company GIL ""(deliberation of the restricted formation n°SAN-2020-012 of December 7, 2020 concerning the companies GOOGLE LLC and GOOGLE IRELAND LIMITED, pt. 42). It notes that these findings still appear valid at the date of this deliberation. 75. Secondly, with regard to the existence of processing carried out ""in the context of the activities"" of this establishment, the Restricted Committee notes that the CJEU, in its Google Spain judgment of 13 May 2014, considered that the processing relating to the Google Search search engine was carried out ""within the framework of the activities"" of the company GOOGLE SPAIN, an establishment of the company GOOGLE INC - which has since become GOOGLE LLC -, insofar as this company is intended to ensure in Spain the promotion and sale of advertising space offered by this search engine, which serve to make the service offered by this search engine profitable. The CJEU clarified that ""Article 4(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 does not require that the processing of personal data in question be carried out"" by ""the establishment concerned itself, but only that it is “within the framework of the activities” of this one” (pt. 52). According to the Court, ""Article 4(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that processing of personal data is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment in the responsible for this processing on the territory of a Member State, within the meaning of this provision, when the operator of a search engine creates in a Member State a branch or a subsidiary intended to ensure the promotion and sale of advertising space offered by this engine and whose activity is aimed at the inhabitants of this Member State"" (pt. 60). 76. In addition, the Restricted Committee notes that the CJEU subsequently considered, in its Wirtschaftsakademie and Facebook Belgium decisions, that the processing consisting of the collection of personal data by means of cookies placed in users' terminals visiting, in Germany and Belgium, pages hosted on the Facebook social network was respectively carried out ""within the framework of the activities"" of the companies FACEBOOK GERMANY and FACEBOOK BELGIUM, German and Belgian establishments of the Facebook group, insofar as these establishments are intended to ensure, in their respective countries, the promotion and sale of the advertising space offered by this social network, which serves to make the service offered by Facebook profitable (CJEU, Grand Chamber, 5 June 2018, Wirtschaftsakademie, C-210/16, pts 56 to 60; 15 June 2021, Facebook Belgium, C-645/19, pts. 92 to 95). If in the Google Spain judgment, Spanish jurisdiction had been retained for processing for which the effective responsibility fell to companies based in the United States, outside the European Union, in these latter judgments, the CJEU extended its reasoning to case where the actual responsibility for the processing lies with a company established in another country of the European Union. 77. The Restricted Committee notes that, even if these three judgments concerned more specifically ""subsequent processing"" implemented from cookies deposited in users' terminals, which justified the application of Directive 95/46/EC for the Google Spain and Wirtschaftsakademie cases and of the GDPR for the Facebook Belgium case, this case law remains relevant to clarify the scope to be given to the notion of processing carried out ""in the context of the activities"" of an establishment, insofar as the legislator French took it up during the transposition of the ""ePrivacy"" directive to establish the territorial jurisdiction of the CNIL with regard to the processing covered by this directive. 78. In the present case, and in addition to the previous developments appearing above in paragraph74, the Restricted Committee notes that, according to the information posted on its website, the company GOOGLE FRANCE supports in particular small and medium-sized enterprises in France "" through the development of collaboration tools, advertising solutions or to give them the keys to understanding their markets and their consumers"". Then, it has already recorded, in its deliberation n ° SAN-2020-012 of December 7, 2020 that, ""in its letter of April 30, 2020 the company GIL indicates that ""Google France has a sales team dedicated to the promotion and the sale of GIL's services to advertisers and publishers based in France, such as Google Ads "" "" (point no. 44). This finding still appears to be valid as of the date of this deliberation. Finally, the Restricted Committee notes that it is specified on the ""ads.google.com"" website that ""Google Ads allows French companies to promote their products or services on the search engine and on a large advertising network"". 79. Thus, the processing consisting of information access or registration operations in the terminal of users of the Google Search search engine and YouTube residing in France, in particular for advertising purposes, is carried out within the framework of the activities of the company GOOGLE FRANCE on French territory, which is in charge of the promotion and marketing of GOOGLE products and their advertising solutions in France. The Restricted Committee notes that the two criteria provided for in Article 3, paragraph I, of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law are therefore met. 80. It follows that French law is applicable and that the CNIL is materially and territorially competent to exercise its powers, including that of imposing sanctions concerning processing falling within the scope of the ""ePrivacy"" directive. D. On the complaint alleging the illegality of this sanction procedure 81. The companies contest the fact that they did not receive any formal notice before the president of the CNIL decided to open a sanction procedure, unlike other actors, thus invoking a difference in treatment between GIL and GOOGLE LLC and the sixty companies that the CNIL declared to have given formal notice for similar acts in its press releases of May 25 and July 19, 2021 published on its website. 82. Firstly, with regard to the companies' argument that the provisions opposed to them by the rapporteur entered into force less than five months before the start of the sanction procedure, the Restricted Committee recalls that, in within the framework of this deliberation, it is based exclusively on the provisions of article 82 of the law ""Informatique et Libertés"", enlightened by the reinforced requirements in terms of consent of the GDPR, which came into force in May 2018. Therefore, the legal framework applicable to the facts giving rise to this sanction procedure is fully established. 83. The Restricted Committee also recalls that, from June 2019 and on various occasions thereafter, the CNIL communicated on its action plan which comprised two main stages: the publication of new guidelines in July 2019 and consultation with professionals to draw up a new recommendation, proposing operational methods for obtaining consent. The CNIL had specified, in a press release of June 28, 2019, that it would carry out verifications of compliance with the recommendation six months after its final adoption. The Restricted Committee notes that the CNIL had been perfectly transparent on the timetable, in order to allow organizations time to bring themselves into compliance before carrying out checks. 84. Secondly, the Restricted Committee recalls that, in accordance with Article 20 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law, the President of the CNIL is not required to send a formal notice to a data controller before to initiate sanction proceedings against him. It adds that the possibility of directly initiating sanction proceedings has been confirmed by the Council of State (see, in particular, CE, 4 Nov. 2020, application no. 433311, pt. 3). 85. It also notes that the Secretary General of the CNIL had reminded companies, in his letters of February 17, 2021, that it must be as easy to give consent as to refuse to give it or to withdraw it. It also notes that GOOGLE LLC and GIL have already been the subject of sanction proceedings relating to their cookie policy. The companies were well aware that they were exposing themselves to possible other sanctions since, according to a press release published on May 4, 2021, the CNIL had indicated that the closure of the injunction only related to the perimeter of the injunction issued by the Restricted Committee in its deliberation of December 7, 2020. It specified that this closing decision did not prejudge the CNIL's analysis of the compliance of ""google.fr"" with other rules on cookies , relating in particular to consent, which are informed by the guidelines and the recommendation of September 17, 2020, according to which the user must now be able to refuse cookies as easily as he can accept them. The CNIL specified that it reserved the possibility of controlling these refusal procedures and, if necessary, of mobilizing its entire repressive chain, it being specified that the CNIL had received several complaints on this subject. Thus, the Restricted Committee considers that the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL were not in the same situation as other organizations that were the subject of formal notices from the CNIL and that the grievance based on the illegality of the sanction procedure must be dismissed. E. On the request for a preliminary ruling 86. In the alternative, the companies ask the Restricted Committee to refer a preliminary question to the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter the ""CJEU"") in these terms: ""the absence of a ""refuse all"" button ""next to an ""accept all"" button be considered a breach of GDPR Article 4(11) and Article 7, read in conjunction with GDPR Article 5(3) -Privacy while the data controller gives the data subject the right to refuse said processing in the second level of the cookie banner and through the browser settings and informs him of this possibility of refusing the processing and the means by which he has to do it from the first level of the cookie banner? "". The companies believe that the restricted formation is a jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereinafter ""TFEU"") and that it meets the criteria of a jurisdiction: it is established permanently by the law ""Informatique et Libertés""; it has compulsory jurisdiction when the president of the CNIL decides to initiate a sanction procedure; it follows a procedure of an adversarial nature between the rapporteur and the respondent; it applies the rules of law and is independent and impartial. 87. The Restricted Committee recalls that, for a body to be able to address a question for a preliminary ruling to the CJEU, it must enjoy the status of ""court"" within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU, an autonomous concept in Union law. To assess this quality, the CJEU takes into consideration the following criteria: legal origin of the body, its permanence, its mandatory nature, adversarial nature of its procedure, application of the rules of law, its independence and judicial nature of its decisions. 88. The Restricted Committee notes that it is not qualified as a court in domestic law: no legislative provision has recognized it as such. If, as noted by the companies, the Council of State has already ruled that ""in view of its nature, composition and powers"", the restricted body may be qualified as a ""court"" within the meaning of Article 6-1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (hereinafter the ""CESDH"") (Council of State, judge in chambers, February 19, 2008, No. 311974), this decision does not, however, recognize the quality of jurisdiction. 89. The Restricted Committee considers, contrary to what the companies maintain, that the criteria adopted by the CJEU on the notion of jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU, in particular in its recent ANESCO judgment (CJEU, 16 Sept. 2020, Anesco, C-462/19), are not met by the Restricted Committee. Indeed, in this judgment, the CJEU stated that, ""it must be noted that the decisions that the CNMC \[the Spanish competition authority\] is called upon to adopt in cases such as that at issue in the main proceedings are similar to decisions of an administrative nature, excluding their adoption in the exercise of judicial functions"" (§41). However, the same applies to the decisions taken by the restricted committee, which are decisions of an administrative nature since they are sanction decisions which contribute to the effectiveness of the action of the CNIL in its regulatory power. The sanction decision puts an end to the administrative procedure initiated and an administrative contentious appeal can then be brought against it before the Council of State. 90. In addition, the Restricted Committee notes that the Court of Cassation considered that ""it follows from these texts of European Union law, as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union, that the Autorité de la concurrence is not a competent court to ask it a preliminary question pursuant to Article 267 of the TFEU (CJEU, judgment of September 16, 2020, Anesco, C-462/19, concerning the Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia, Spanish competition authority)"" (Cass. 2nd civ., September 30, 2021, n° 20-18.302). However, the Autorité de la concurrence, as an independent administrative authority, has major organizational and procedural similarities with the restricted formation. 91. Consequently, the Restricted Committee cannot be classified as a court within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU, so that it is not able to refer a question to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling. F. On the determination of the controller 92. The Restricted Committee notes, first of all, that Articles 4, paragraph 7, and 26, paragraph 1, of the GDPR are applicable to this procedure because of the use of the concept of ""data controller"" in the article 82 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law, which is justified by the reference made by article 2 of the ""ePrivacy"" directive to directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data, which has been replaced by the GDPR. 93. According to Article 4(7) of the GDPR, the controller is “the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing"". According to Article 26(1) of the GDPR, ""where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of the processing, they are the joint controllers"". 94. The rapporteur considers that the companies GIL and GOOGLE LLC are joint controllers of the processing in question pursuant to these provisions since the companies both determine the purposes and means of the processing consisting of access or registration of information in the terminal of users residing in France when using the Google Search search engine and YouTube. 95. The companies respond that the company GIL would be solely responsible for the processing of personal data of users located in the European Economic Area and in Switzerland. 96. The Restricted Committee recalls that the CJEU has ruled on several occasions on the notion of joint responsibility for processing, in particular in its Jehovah's Witnesses judgment. In its terms, it considered that, according to the provisions of Article 2(d) of Directive 95/46 on the protection of personal data, ""the concept of 'controller' refers to the person natural or legal person who, ""alone or jointly with others"", determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. This notion therefore does not necessarily refer to a single natural or legal person and may concern several actors taking part in this processing, each of them must then be subject to the applicable data protection provisions \[…\] The objective of this provision being to ensure, by a broad definition of the notion of ""responsible"" , effective and complete protection of the persons concerned, the existence of joint responsibility does not necessarily translate into equivalent responsibility, for the same processing of personal data, of the different all actors. On the contrary, these actors may be involved at different stages of this processing and to different degrees, so that the level of responsibility of each of them must be assessed taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the case. (CJEU, July 10, 2018, C 25/17, pts. 65 and 66). 97. The Restricted Committee considers that these developments make it possible to usefully shed light on the notion of joint processing responsibility invoked by the rapporteur with regard to the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL concerned by the processing in question. 98. The Restricted Committee points out, finally, that if the present procedure does not relate to the same facts as those mentioned in the context of deliberation no. SAN-2020-012 of December 7, 2020 for the reasons developed above, it still concerns the read and write operations implemented in the user's terminal located in France by the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL, for which the role of the two companies has already been examined by the restricted committee in the deliberation mentioned above. 99. The Restricted Committee also recalls that, in this same deliberation of December 7, 2020, it considered that the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL jointly determine the purposes and means of the processing consisting of access or registration operations. information in the terminal of users residing in France when using the Google Search search engine (pts. 47 to 66 of the deliberation). It considers that this observation is still valid on the date of this deliberation and can be extended to the cookies used on the ""youtube.com"" site, as demonstrated by the elements developed below. 1. On the responsibility of the company GIL 100. The companies maintain that the company GIL acts as controller of the processing in question, which the rapporteur also considers. 101. The Restricted Committee agrees with this analysis. 102. Firstly, it notes that it retained in its deliberation no. SAN-2020-012, that ""the representatives of the companies declared that the company GIL"" participates in the development and supervision of the internal policies which guide the products and their design, the implementation of parameters, the determination of confidentiality rules and all the checks carried out before the launch of the products, in application of the ""privacy by design"" principle. 103. Secondly, it recalls that it has also pointed out that, ""with regard more particularly to cookies, the representatives stated \[…\] that ""GIL applies, for example, shorter retention periods for cookies"" by compared to other regions of the world and that it ""limits the extent of processing related to the personalization of advertising in Europe compared to the rest of the world. For example, GIL does not use certain categories of data to perform personalized advertising such as assumed household resources. GIL does not set up personalized advertising for children whom it assumes are minors within the meaning of the GDPR"". 104. The Restricted Committee concluded that ""the company GIL is, at least in part, responsible for the controlled processing consisting of operations of access or registration of information in the terminal of users residing in France during the use of the search engine Google Search"". 105. The Restricted Committee considers that no change in the role of GIL appears to have taken place since this recent observation, which therefore remains valid. It considers that the same applies to the ""youtube.com"" site since, in Google's terms of use, accessible both via the ""google.fr"" and ""youtube.com"" sites , it is identically stated that: ""In the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, Google services are provided to you by the company below with which you are contracting: Google Ireland Limited"". 106. Thus, the company GIL is, at least in part, responsible for the processing consisting of operations of access or registration of information in the terminal of users residing in France when using the search engine Google Search and YouTube. 2. On the liability of GOOGLE LLC 107. The companies dispute the rapporteur's analysis that GOOGLE LLC shares responsibility for the processing in question with GIL. 108. The Restricted Committee has already taken a position on this subject, in its deliberation no. SAN-2020-012 of December 7, 2020. 109. Firstly, it had noted that, during the hearing of July 22, 2020, the representatives of the companies had affirmed that the company GOOGLE LLC ""designs and builds the technology of Google products and that with regard to cookies deposited and read when using the Google Search search engine, there is no difference in technology between the cookies deposited from the different versions of the search engine. offer French users in the rules of use accessible from ""google.fr"", make no distinction in their presentation of the cookies used by the GOOGLE group when they indicate that they use ""different types of cookies for products associated with advertisements and websites of Google "" "", which also includes the site "" youtube.com "" according to the restricted formation. 110. It notes that even today, there is still no difference in the presentation of the cookies used by Google (information provided to French users from the ""Technologies"" tab, ""how Google uses cookies"", after having clicked on the ""terms of use"" button, accessible both on ""google.fr"" and on ""youtube.com""). The company ""describes the types of cookies used by Google"", stating that ""some or all of the cookies described below may be stored in your browser"". The Restricted Committee also notes that the privacy rules accessible both from ""google.fr"" and from ""youtube.com"" confirm this point when it is stated that ""These Privacy Rules apply to all the services offered by Google LLC and its affiliates, including YouTube and Android, as well as services offered on third-party sites, such as advertising services"". 111. Thus, in the information they provide to French users, the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL still make no distinction in their presentation of the cookies used by the GOOGLE group. 112. Secondly, the Restricted Committee had also noted, in its aforementioned deliberation, that ""despite the unquestionable participation of the company GIL in the various stages and bodies related to the definition of the methods of implementation of the cookies deposited on Google Search , the matrix organization described by the companies \[…\] has shown that the company GOOGLE LLC is also represented in the bodies adopting the decisions relating to the deployment of the products within the EEA and in Switzerland and to the processing of data to personal character of the users residing there and that it exercises a significant influence there"" or that ""the data protection officer appointed by the company GIL \[…\] as well as its assistant DPOs are based in California as employees of the company GOOGLE LLC"". 113. Thirdly, the Restricted Committee had considered that, ""although under a formal reading of the subcontracting contract of December 11, 2018, the company GOOGLE LLC would act as a subcontractor of the company GIL in the processing of European user data collected via cookies, the actual involvement of GOOGLE LLC in the processing in question goes far beyond that of a subcontractor who would simply carry out processing operations on behalf of the company GIL and on its sole instructions"". 114. In view of the evidence in the file, the Restricted Committee maintains that GOOGLE LLC plays a fundamental role in the entire decision-making process relating to the processing in question. It also determines the means of processing given that, as mentioned above, it is the company that designs and builds the cookie technology placed on the terminals of European users. The Restricted Committee notes that, if it had only ruled on the Google Search search engine in its deliberation No. SAN-2020-012 of December 7, 2020, it considers that the same reasoning is applicable, on the basis of these same elements, for YouTube, in particular insofar as, when the user clicks on ""Privacy policy"" and ""Terms of use"" from ""youtube.com"", he is referred to the privacy policy and GOOGLE Group Terms of Service. 115. It follows from all of the foregoing that the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL jointly determine the purposes and means of the processing consisting of operations to access or register information in the terminal of users residing in France. when using the Google Search search engine and YouTube. G. On the breach of cookie obligations 116. Under the terms of article 82 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law, ""any subscriber or user of an electronic communications service must be informed in a clear and complete manner, unless he has been informed beforehand, by the controller or his representative: 1° The purpose of any action seeking to access, by electronic transmission, information already stored in its electronic communications terminal equipment, or to enter information in this equipment; 2° The means at his disposal to oppose it. This access or registration can only take place on condition that the subscriber or user has expressed, after having received this information, his consent which may result from appropriate parameters of his connection device or any other device placed under his control. \[…\] "". 117. The ""ePrivacy"" directive provides for its part in its article 2, f), that the consent of a user or subscriber corresponds to the consent of the person concerned appearing in Directive 95/46/EC, to which replaced the GDPR. 118. Thus, since the entry into force of the GDPR, the ""consent"" provided for in the aforementioned Article 82 must be understood within the meaning of Article 4, paragraph 11, of the GDPR, i.e. 'it must be given in a free, specific, enlightened and unequivocal manner and manifest itself in a clear positive act. 119. In this respect, recital 42 of this Regulation provides that: ""consent should not be considered to have been freely given if the data subject does not have a real freedom of choice or is not able to refuse or withdraw consent without prejudice"". 120. In the present case, in the context of the online check of June 1, 2021, the delegation noted that, to give their consent to the reading and/or writing of information in their terminal, the user going to the home page of the sites ""google.fr"" and ""youtube.com"" must only click on the ""I accept"" button of the pop-up window, which makes this window disappear and allows him to continue browsing. On the other hand, the user visiting these same home pages and wishing to refuse cookies must click on the ""Personalise"" button of this first window, which gives him access to both the ""google.fr"" sites. and ""youtube.com"", to an interface offering him to choose to activate or deactivate cookies, on which he has the possibility of carrying out various actions. 121. The rapporteur notes, by way of clarification, that under the terms of his guidelines 5/2020 on consent within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, adopted on 4 May 2020, the EDPS recalled that ""the ""free"" implies real choice and control for the persons concerned"" (§13). 122. Similarly, in the context of its deliberation No. 2020-092 of September 17, 2020 adopting a recommendation proposing practical methods of compliance in the event of the use of ""cookies and other tracers"", the Commission considered , taking into account the aforementioned applicable texts, that ""the controller must offer users both the possibility of accepting and refusing read and/or write operations with the same degree of simplicity"". 123. On the basis of the findings made in the context of the online check, the rapporteur observes that, if the banner displayed on the ""google.fr"" and ""youtube.com"" sites contains a button allowing immediate acceptance of cookies , no similar means are offered to the user to be able to refuse, so easily, the deposit of these cookies. To refuse cookies, he must perform at least five actions (the first click on the ""Customize"" button, then a click on each of the three buttons to select ""Disabled"" - each button corresponding to ""search personalization"", the 'YouTube history' and 'Ads personalization' - and finally a click on 'Confirm'), against a single action to accept them. Such a mechanism therefore does not, according to the rapporteur, offer the same facility as that allowing consent to be expressed, in disregard of the legal requirements of freedom of consent, which imply not encouraging the Internet user to accept cookies rather than to refuse them. It thus considers that making the mechanism for refusing cookies more complex than that consisting in accepting them, in reality amounts to discouraging users from refusing cookies and encouraging them to favor the ease of the ""I accept"" button. The rapporteur concludes that the procedures for refusing cookies implemented by the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL on the ""google.fr"" and ""youtube.com"" sites do not comply with the provisions of article 82 of the law "" Computing and Liberties” as informed by the reinforced consent requirements laid down by the GDPR. 124. The companies consider that neither the ""ePrivacy"" directive, nor the GDPR, nor article 82 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law provide that the action of refusing cookies must be as simple as accepting them. They add that, for many years, the CNIL itself had not deduced this principle even though the regulations in question had remained unchanged since the entry into force of the GDPR. They note that the CNIL cannot, through its guidelines and recommendations, introduce new requirements relating to the refusal of consent and consider that it is up to each data controller to choose the most appropriate method of obtaining consent. In this, the companies consider that the consent collection mechanism set up on the ""google.fr"" and ""youtube.com"" sites already complies with the provisions of article 82 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law. "". The companies consider that the fact of not offering, at the first level of information, a ""Refuse all"" button is not contrary to the principle of freedom of consent insofar as users do have the possibility of refusing cookies by clicking on the ""Customize"" button. 125. Firstly, the Restricted Committee recalls that pursuant to Article 8 I, 2°, b) of the ""Data Processing and Liberties"" law, the CNIL ""establishes and publishes guidelines, recommendations or reference systems intended to facilitate the compliance of the processing of personal data with the texts relating to the protection of personal data \[…\]”. 126. It is within this framework that the CNIL took deliberation no. reading or writing in a user's terminal (in particular to cookies and other tracers), which provided in its article 2, ""that it must be as easy to refuse or withdraw consent as to give it""; then deliberations no. 2020-091 of September 17, 2020 adopting guidelines relating to the application of article 82 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended to read and/or write operations in the terminal of a user (in particular to ""cookies and other tracers"") and No. 2020-092 adopting a recommendation proposing practical methods of compliance in the event of the use of ""cookies and other tracers"". These instruments aim to interpret the applicable legislative provisions and to inform the players on the implementation of concrete measures to guarantee compliance with these provisions, so that they implement these measures or measures with equivalent effect. In this sense, it is specified in the guidelines that the main purpose of these ""is to recall and explain the law applicable to the operations of reading and/or writing information \[…\] in the terminal equipment electronic communications of the subscriber or user, and in particular the use of cookies"". 127. As indicated above, the Commission considered, in the context of its recommendation of September 17, 2020, that ""the data controller must offer users both the possibility of accepting and of refusing read operations and/or of writing with the same degree of simplicity"". 128. With regard to the possible refusal procedures, in this same recommendation, the Commission ""strongly recommended that the mechanism making it possible to express a refusal to consent to read and/or write operations be accessible on the same screen and with the same ease as the mechanism for expressing consent. Indeed, it considers that consent collection interfaces that require a single click to consent to tracking while several actions are necessary to ""parameterize"" a refusal to consent present , in most cases, the risk of biasing the choice of the user, who wishes to be able to view the site or use the application quickly. For example, at the stage of the first level of information, users can have the choice between two buttons presented at the same level and in the same format, on which are written respectively ""accept all"" and ""reject all"", ""authorize"" and ""prohibit"", or ""consent"" and ""not consent"", or any other equivalent and sufficiently clear wording. The Commission considers that this modality constitutes a simple and clear way to allow the user to express his refusal as easily as his consent"". 129. The Restricted Committee considers that the CNIL limited itself, in its recommendation mentioned above, to clarifying the obligations provided for by French and European legislators, drawing in particular all the consequences of the principle of freedom of consent as defined in article 4, paragraph 11, of the GDPR, and by applying them to the hypotheses of acceptance and refusal by the user of the deposit of cookies on his terminal. Indeed, this principle of freedom of consent now implies that the user benefits from a ""genuine freedom of choice"", as underlined in recital 42 of the GDPR, and therefore that the methods offered to him to express this choice are not biased in favor of consent. As the EDPS recalled in its guidelines on consent, adopted on 4 May 2020, the adjective ""free"" implies real choice and control for the data subjects. 130. It thus appears that the CNIL did not create new obligations for the actors in its recommendation but limited itself to illustrating in concrete terms how Article 82 of the law should be applied. 131. Secondly, the Restricted Committee notes that the position of the CNIL on this point, according to which it must be as simple for users to refuse cookies as to consent to them, already appeared in Article 2 of the guidelines of July 4, 2019 - abrogated by those of September 17, 2020 - and that it has been ratified by the Council of State. Indeed, seized of an appeal for excess of power brought against these first guidelines, the Council of State ruled, in its decision Association of communication consulting agencies, that ""the CNIL which, by indicating that it had to ""to be as easy to refuse or withdraw consent as to give it"", was limited to characterizing the conditions of the user's refusal, without defining the specific technical methods for expressing such a refusal, has tainted its deliberation with any ignorance of the rules applicable in the matter"" (CE, June 19, 2020, n° 434684, T., pt 15). 132. The Restricted Committee considers that this reading is all the more necessary in view of the conclusions of the public rapporteur on this judgment, which noted: ""As indicated by the CNIL, the contested guidelines do not impose any technical method of collection of this refusal. They confine themselves to requiring, generally and rightly, that it should not be more complicated to refuse than to accept"" (CE, conclusions of the public rapporteur on judgment no. 434684, p. 17). 133. Thirdly, the panel notes that in this case, users residing in France visiting the Google Search search engine and/or YouTube must perform a single action to accept cookies, whereas they must perform five to refuse them. It is therefore not as simple to refuse cookies as to accept them. 134. However, it appears from several recent studies that organizations that have set up a ""refuse all"" button on the consent collection interface at the first level have seen the consent rate relating to the acceptance of cookies decrease. Thus, according to the ""Privacy barometer - 2021 edition"" published by the company COMMANDERS ACT, the rate of consent on computers fell from 70% to 55% in April-May 2021, since the collection of consent is explicit. Similarly, according to a 366-Kantar study, it appears that 41% of Internet users in France refused, systematically or partially, the deposit of cookies in June 2021. 135. The Restricted Committee thus considers that making the mechanism for refusing cookies more complex than that consisting in accepting them actually amounts to discouraging users from refusing cookies and encouraging them to favor the ease of the ""Accept all"" button. "". Indeed, an Internet user is generally led to consult many sites. Internet browsing is characterized by its speed and fluidity. The fact of having to click on ""Customize"" and having to understand the way in which the page allowing the refusal of cookies is constructed is likely to discourage the user, who would nevertheless wish to refuse the deposit of cookies. It is not disputed that in this case, the companies offer a choice between the acceptance or the refusal of cookies, but the methods by which this refusal can be expressed, in the context of Internet browsing, skews the expression of choice in favor of consent in such a way as to alter the freedom of choice. 136. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Committee considers that a breach of the provisions of Article 82 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law, interpreted in the light of the GDPR, is constituted, insofar as the companies do not do not make available to users located in France, on the ""google.fr"" and ""youtube.com"" websites, a means of refusing operations to read and/or write information in their terminal presenting the same degree of simplicity than that intended to accept its use. III. On corrective measures and publicity 137. Article 20, paragraph III, of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law provides: ""When the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 mentioned above or of this law, the president of the National Commission for Data Processing and Liberties may also, if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, if necessary in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, seize the restricted formation of the commission with a view to the pronouncement, after adversarial procedure, of one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 2° An injunction to bring the processing into compliance with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or from this law or to satisfy the requests presented by the person concerned with a view to exercising their rights, which may be accompanied, except in cases where the processing is implemented by the State, with a penalty payment the amount of which may not exceed €100,000 per day of delay from the date set by the restricted committee; \[…\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the annual worldwide turnover total for the previous year, whichever is higher. \[…\] The Restricted Committee takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same Article 83”. 138. Article 83 of the GDPR, as referred to in Article 20, paragraph III, of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law, provides that ""Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the administrative fines imposed pursuant to of this Article for breaches of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive"", before specifying the elements to be taken into account in deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide on the amount of this fine. A. On the imposition of administrative fines and their amount 139. The companies claim that the amount of the fines proposed by the rapporteur is unpredictable, disproportionate and unjustified. They contest the fact that, unlike other French or European administrative authorities with sanctioning powers, the CNIL has not provided guidelines for calculating its fines. The companies also add that the rapporteur does not explain the distribution of the amount of the fine between GOOGLE LLC and GIL. 140. In addition, the companies maintain that by refusing to enter into discussions with them, the rapporteur deprived them of the possibility of cooperating with the CNIL, and, therefore, of availing themselves of the mitigating circumstance of article 83 -2 f) of the GDPR to reduce the amount of the fine. 141. The Restricted Committee recalls, in general terms, that Article 20, paragraph III, of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law gives it jurisdiction to impose various sanctions, in particular administrative fines the maximum amount of which may be, in cash, equivalent to 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the previous financial year achieved by the data controller. It adds that the determination of the amount of these fines is assessed in the light of the criteria specified by Article 83 of the GDPR. 142. The Restricted Committee notes that the rapporteur is not required to specify how the fines he proposes to the Restricted Committee are calculated. The Council of State has also ruled that the restricted training was not subject to this obligation (CE, 10th/9th, June 19, 2020, req. no. 430810). The Restricted Committee notes that the European courts share this position, since they have already ruled that ""it is not incumbent on the Commission under the obligation to state reasons, to indicate in its decision the figures relating to the method of calculating fines"" (judgment of the Court of 16 November 2000, Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags v Commission, C‑286/98 P, ECR I‑9925, paragraph 66). Jurisprudence only requires that the penalty panel ""show in a clear and detailed manner the reasoning it followed, thus allowing the applicant to know the elements of assessment taken into account to measure the seriousness of the offense for the purposes calculation of the amount of the fine and for the Court to exercise its control"" (judgment of the Court of First Instance, Third Chamber, 8 July 2008, BPB plc v Commission of the European Communities, judgment ECLI:EU:T:2008:254 , paragraph 337, collection of case law 008 II-01333). This position is justified, on the one hand, by the fact that ""fines constitute an instrument of the policy"" of an institution ""which must be able to have a margin of appreciation in fixing their amount in order to direct the behavior of undertakings in the sense of compliance with the rules"" and, secondly, because ""it is important to prevent fines from being easily foreseeable by economic operators. Indeed, if the Commission had the obligation to indicate in its decision the figures relating to the method of calculating the amount of the fines, their deterrent effect would be undermined.If the amount of the fine were the result of a calculation following a simple arithmetic formula, companies would have the possibility of foreseeing the possible sanction and of comparing it with the profits which they would derive from the infringement of the rules of law”. 143. Firstly, the Restricted Committee stresses that it is appropriate, in this case, to apply the criterion provided for in subparagraph a) of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the GDPR relating to the seriousness of the breach. taking into account the nature, the scope of the processing and the number of data subjects. 144. The Restricted Committee notes that, if the companies GIL and GOOGLE LLC refused to communicate the volume of the number of unique visitors from the ""google.fr"" and ""youtube.com"" sites during the last twelve months from France , it appears from the figures available on the internet that in June 2020, Google had more than 51 million unique visitors residing in France per month and YouTube more than 46 million (press release of August 24, 2020 published on the Médiamétrie website) . The number of people affected by the processing in question is therefore extremely large on the scale of the French population. 145. As the Restricted Committee recalled in its deliberation no. SAN-2020-012 of December 7, 2020, the Competition Authority noted that, on the French online search advertising market, Google holds a dominant position which has, in many respects, ""extraordinary"" characteristics. Its search engine now accounts for more than 90% of searches carried out in France and its market share in the online search advertising market is probably over 90% (ADLC, 19 Dec. 2019, Dec. N °19-D-26). The search engine Google Search therefore has a considerable reach in France. 146. Secondly, the Restricted Committee considers that it is appropriate to apply the criterion provided for in subparagraph b) of Article 83(2) of the GDPR, relating to the fact that the violation was committed deliberately. 147. The Restricted Committee recalls that the companies have been the subject of a recent sanction relating to breaches of Article 82 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law with regard to information and the collection of the consent of persons before the deposit of cookies on their terminal. Although this sanction is not definitive since it is the subject of an appeal before the Council of State, the Restricted Committee notes however that the attention of the companies had been explicitly called by the CNIL services to the terms refusal of cookies. As part of the follow-up to the injunction issued by the restricted committee, the companies, on December 18, 2020, through their advisers, sent the CNIL a document in which they presented the changes that GOOGLE intended to deploy on the ""google.fr"" web page to respond to the injunction. On February 17, 2021, the Secretary General of the CNIL sent the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL a response constituting assistance for the companies in order to comply. Said letter went ""beyond the scope of the injunction"" and also mentioned ""the procedures for refusing cookies"". The secretary general of the CNIL reminded companies that it must be as easy to give their consent as to refuse to give it or to withdraw it and indicated that it would be up to them to insert a button ""I refuse"" next to the button ""I accept"", while specifying that they could ""of course change the titles of these buttons as long as they allow the user to clearly and directly understand the consequences of their choices"". It was also specified there that: ""While different ways of complying with the legal requirements are possible, it seems to me that the proposal appearing in your letter, where there is only an ""I accept"" button and a ""Configure"" button, which must be clicked to then understand how it is possible to refuse cookies, does not comply with the legal requirements of freedom of consent"". The secretary general of the CNIL had therefore indicated to the companies, from February 2021, the actions expected with a view to bringing them into compliance at the end of the adaptation period left by the CNIL to the actors and which ended on April 1, 2021. 148. In addition, the restricted training recalls the more general context in which the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL have chosen not to offer their users, on the ""google.fr"" and ""youtube.com"" sites, the option of refusing cookies easily. Indeed, the CNIL has implemented a compliance plan on the issue of cookies spread over several years and has communicated publicly on its website, on several occasions, on the fact that it must be as easy for the Internet user to refuse cookies than to accept them, in particular on October 1, 2020 on the occasion of the publication of the aforementioned guidelines and recommendation of September 17, 2020. The adaptation period left to the players ended on April 1, 2021. Hundreds of thousands of players, from the smallest sites to the largest, have complied and introduced a button "" refuse"" or ""continue without accepting"". 149. In this context, the Restricted Committee considers that the fact that the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL, which are among the major and essential global players on the Internet and manage some of the most visited sites, refuse to set up a system of easy refusal of cookies at the very moment when they were the subject of an injunction follow-up procedure clearly alerting them on this same subject, reveals a clear desire on the part of these companies not to modify their practices. It considers that the companies have intended not to bring into compliance the processing consisting of operations of access or registration of information in the terminal of users residing in France when using the sites ""google.fr"" and "" youtube.com"", nor rely on the recommendations of the CNIL to do this. 150. Thirdly, the Restricted Committee considers that the companies cannot claim exemplary cooperation with the CNIL, even though they have never communicated the volume of the number of unique daily visitors for the ""google.fr"" sites. "" and "" youtube.com "" during the last twelve months from France, elements nevertheless requested by the CNIL control delegation. The Restricted Committee notes that it follows from Article 18 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law that data controllers ""cannot oppose the action of the Commission"" and that they must take ""all useful measures in order to facilitate his task"". Cooperation with the supervisory authority is thus first and foremost an obligation provided for by law. Thus, the obligation to cooperate is far from being fully satisfied in this case, so that there is no need to apply a mitigating circumstance under subparagraph (f) of paragraph 2 of the 83 GDPR. 151. Fourthly, the Restricted Committee considers that it is appropriate to apply the criterion provided for in subparagraph k) of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the Rules relating to the financial advantages obtained as a result of the breach. 152. In this respect, the Restricted Committee notes that the read and write operations, allowing the collection of user data for the purposes of targeted advertising via the ""google.fr"" and ""youtube.com"" sites, allow companies to derive considerable financial benefit. Although it admits that not all of the companies' income is directly linked to cookies, the Restricted Committee emphasizes that online advertising is essentially based on the targeting of Internet users, in which the cookie participates directly by making it possible to single out and reach the identified user with a view to displaying advertising content corresponding to his centers of interest and his profile. 153. It recalls that, as it noted in its aforementioned deliberation no. SAN-2020-012 of December 7, 2020, the GOOGLE group makes most of its profits in the two main segments of the online advertising market that constitute display advertising (Display Advertising) and contextual advertising (Search Advertising), in which cookies play an undeniable, albeit different, role. 154. Firstly, in the segment of display advertising, the purpose of which is to display content in a specific area of a website and in which cookies and trackers are used to identify users during of their navigation, for the purpose of offering them the most personalized content, it is established that the GOOGLE group offers products at all levels of the value chain of this segment and that its products are systematically dominant at these different levels. In this respect, the GOOGLE group indicates, on one of its websites, that it offers an advertising ecosystem accessible from its tools and services capable of reaching more than 2 million sites, videos and applications and more than 90 % of Internet users in the world. 155. Next, the segment of contextual advertising, the object of which is to display sponsored results according to the keywords typed by users into a search engine, also requires the use of cookies in its practical implementation. , for example to be able to determine the geographical location of users and, thereby, adapt the advertisements offered according to this location. In this respect, it appears from ALPHABET's annual report for the year 2019 that this segment alone constitutes, through in particular the Google Ads service - formerly AdWords -, 61% of the turnover of the GOOGLE group. 156. If, in the context of the procedure that gave rise to the aforementioned deliberation, the Restricted Committee was unaware of the amount of profit derived by the GOOGLE group from the collection and use of cookies on the French market via income generated by advertising targeted at French Internet users, it noted ""that a proportional approximation based on publicly available figures would lead to an estimate that France would contribute between $680 and $755 million to ALPHABET's annual net income , the parent company of the GOOGLE group, i.e., at the current exchange rate, between 580 and 640 million euros"". 157. In addition, the Restricted Committee emphasizes once again that it emerges from the studies mentioned above that the companies which have set up a ""refuse all"" button on the consent collection interface have seen the relative consent rate to the acceptance of cookies decrease. Indeed, when a button appearing at the first level allows them to refuse cookies, a large proportion of Internet users completely or partially refuse cookies and other tracers, which necessarily has an impact in terms of income related to online advertising. . These elements therefore confirm the undeniable financial advantage derived from the breach committed by the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL by not setting up a mechanism for refusing consent as easy as that of accepting cookies. 158. Finally, the Restricted Committee recalls that pursuant to the provisions of Article 20 paragraph III of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law, the companies GOOGLE LLC and GIL incur a financial penalty of a maximum amount of 2% their turnover, which was respectively \[…\] dollars in 2020 in the case of GOOGLE LLC and more than \[…\]euros in 2019 in the case of GIL. 159. In its deliberation no. SAN-2020-012 of December 7, 2020, the Restricted Committee demonstrated the greater involvement of the company GOOGLE LLC in determining the purposes and means of the cookies implemented on the ""google. fr "" compared to the company GIL. Indeed, it is the company GOOGLE LLC that designs and builds the technology of GOOGLE products. In addition, GOOGLE LLC exercises significant influence in the bodies deciding on the deployment of GOOGLE products in Europe and the processing of personal data of European users. 160. The Restricted Committee points out that due to the massive use of the Google Search search engine and of YouTube in France, the number of people concerned by the breach found is considerable. It also notes the considerable profits made by companies, through the advertising revenue indirectly generated by the data collected by these cookies. 161. Therefore, with regard to the respective responsibilities of the companies, their financial capacities and the relevant criteria of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the Rules mentioned above, the Restricted Committee considers that a fine of 90 million euros to against the company GOOGLE LLC and a fine of 60 million euros against the company GIL appear justified. B. On the issuance of an injunction 162. The companies maintain that the request for an injunction formulated by the rapporteur is useless, considering that it was not necessary to open a sanction procedure. 163. They also dispute the amount of the daily penalty payment proposed in addition to the injunction since the rapporteur does not demonstrate the need for this penalty payment or the proportionality of its amount, which is the maximum amount provided for by the law ""Informatique et Libertés"". 164. Finally, they challenge the deadline proposed by the rapporteur after which the penalty payment could be liquidated, considering that the modification of the consent collection mechanism requires complex and substantial computer programming work. They indicate that GIL would need at least six months to comply with the terms of the injunction. 165. Firstly, the Restricted Committee notes that in the current state of the cookie banner on the ""google.fr"" and ""youtube.com"" sites, users still do not have a means of refusing the operations of reading and/or writing information in their terminal having the same degree of simplicity as that provided for accepting its use. It therefore considers it necessary to issue an injunction so that the companies comply with the applicable obligations in this area. 166. Secondly, the Restricted Committee recalls that in order to keep the penalty payment its comminatory function, its amount must be both proportionate to the seriousness of the breaches committed but also adapted to the financial capacities of the controller. It notes, moreover, that for the determination of this amount, it must also be taken into account that the breach concerned by the injunction indirectly contributes to the profits generated by the controller. 167. Thirdly, with regard to the time that would be necessary to execute the injunction, the Restricted Committee takes note of the arguments put forward by the companies while taking into account the technical and human resources at their disposal. 168. In view of these elements, the Restricted Committee considers as justified the issuance of an injunction accompanied by a penalty payment in the amount of 100,000 euros per day of delay and liquidable at the end of a period of three months. . C. On advertising 169. The Restricted Committee considers that the publication of this decision is justified in view of the number of people concerned and the seriousness of the breach. 170. The Restricted Committee notes that this measure will make it possible to alert users residing in France of the ""google.fr"" and ""youtube.com"" sites of the characterization of the breach of Article 82 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law and to inform them of the persistence of the breach on the day of this deliberation and of the injunction issued against the companies to remedy it. 171. Finally, the measure is not disproportionate since the decision will no longer identify the companies by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The CNIL Restricted Committee, after having deliberated, decides to: • impose an administrative fine on GOOGLE LLC in the amount of 90,000,000 euros (ninety million euros) for breach of article 82 of the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law, • pronounce against the company GOOGLE IRELAND LIMITED an administrative fine of 60,000,000 euros (sixty million euros) for breach of article 82 of the law ""Informatique et Libertés, • pronounce against the companies GOOGLE LLC and GOOGLE IRELAND LIMITED an injunction to modify, on the websites ""google.fr"" and ""youtube.com"", the procedures for obtaining the consent of users located in France to the reading operations and/or write information in their terminal, by offering them a means of refusing these operations presenting a simplicity equivalent to the mechanism provided for their acceptance, in order to guarantee the freedom of their consent; • attach to the injunction a penalty payment of 100,000 euros (one hundred thousand euros) per day of delay at the end of a period of three months following the notification of this deliberation, the proof of compliance must be sent to the restricted training within this period; • send this decision to the company GOOGLE FRANCE for its execution; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the companies by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. President Alexander LINDEN This decision may be appealed to the Council of State within four months of its notification."

Faits et procédure 1. DEDALUS BIOLOGY (hereinafter ""the company"") is a simplified joint stock company with a single partner registered in the Strasbourg commercial and company register under the number 348 585 233 since December 1, 1988. It is active in publishing application software. It has between ten and nineteen employees. 2. DEDALUS BIOLOGIE is part of the DEDALUS group, which employs around nine hundred people and which is made up, in France, of five companies. 3. DEDALUS BIOLOGY markets software solutions for medical analysis laboratories, called laboratory management solutions. About three thousand private medical biology laboratories and between thirty and fifty analysis laboratories of public health establishments are equipped with solutions published by the company DEDALUS BIOLOGIE 4. To this day, five software packages are marketed, among which KALISIL software. Two solutions previously marketed by DEDALUS BIOLOGIE are no longer maintained and are considered obsolete, among which MEGABUS, whose ""end of life"" was reached in September 2019 according to the company. Customers using the MEGABUS solution received a letter sent by the company NETIKA (former name of DEDALUS BIOLOGIE) in 2018 to inform them of the ""final cessation of maintenance"" of this solution. 5. For the use of software marketed by the companies DEDALUS FRANCE and DEDALUS BIOLOGIE, customers acquire a license. DEDALUS BIOLOGIE also provides installation, start-up and customer support services for the use of software. A maintenance contract is generally concluded to ensure updates of the solutions, which include in particular new functionalities and make it possible to maintain the solutions in accordance with the standards in force. 6. On February 23, 2021, a press article entitled ""Confidential information for 500,000 French patients stolen from laboratories and disseminated online"" was published by the newspaper Liberation. This article reported the presence on a forum of a download link to a file containing the medico-administrative data of nearly 500,000 people: ""According to specialists, the leak is of unprecedented scale in France for data relating to health. The file in question, which ""CheckNews"" was able to consult, contains the complete identity of almost half a million French people, often accompanied by critical data, such as information on their state of health or even their password. Initially shared on hacker forums, this database is increasingly widely distributed. "". 7. Pursuant to decision n ° 2021-028C of the president of the National Commission for Information Technology and Freedoms (below the ""Commission"" or the ""CNIL"") February 24, 2021, the CNIL carried out an online control mission to verify compliance with Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, as amended, relating to information technology, files and freedoms (below the ""IT and Freedom Law"") and the rules (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (hereinafter the ""RGPD"" or the ""Rules"") any treatment accessible from domains \[...\] or relating to personal data collected from them. 8. As part of the online check carried out, the file containing the medico-administrative data was downloaded. It appeared that the personal data of 491,840 patients were included, including: - identification data: social security number, surname, first names, sex, postal address, telephone number, email address, date of last medical visit, date of birth; - two columns of free comments containing in particular information relating to patient pathologies (HIV, cancers, genetic diseases), pregnancy, drug treatments followed by the patient or genetic data; - identification data of the prescribing doctor: surname, first name, postal address, telephone number, email address; - data relating to the sampler: surname, first name, address, telephone number; - data relating to the patient's mutual fund: ""Id third party paying"" (continuation of figures), postal address, telephone number; - a column ""SR identifier"" and a column ""PM"", corresponding, with regard to its content, to the identifiers and passwords used by the patient to connect to its space. 9. Pursuant to Decision No. 2021-029C of the President of the Commission of February 25, 2021, the CNIL carried out a documentary control mission with the companies DEDALUS FRANCE and DEDALUS BIOLOGIE, in order to verify compliance with the IT and Freedoms law and the RGPD of treatments implemented by medical analysis laboratories using the solutions or services marketed by these companies. This mission was carried out by sending a questionnaire to DEDALUS FRANCE, sent by email on February 25, 2021. 10. On February 26, the company sent response elements to the CNIL, including the names and addresses of the medical analysis laboratories concerned by the above-mentioned data breach. 11. Pursuant to the same decision, a CNIL delegation proceeded, March 1, 2021, to an on-site control mission in the premises of DEDALUS FRANCE, located 22, avenue Galilée at PLESSIS-ROBINSON (92350) after informing the territorial public prosecutor and the data protection officer of DEDALUS FRANCE and DEDALUS BIOLOGY 12. On March 5, March 10, April 1, April 6 and April 19, 2021, the companies DEDALUS FRANCE and DEDALUS BIOLOGIE transmitted the additional elements requested by the delegation during the on-site inspection. 13. In parallel, on March 1, 2021, the CNIL issued an interim assignment from hour to hour to the various Internet service providers, in order to ensure the effective blocking of the file containing the data of nearly 500,000 patients. 14. Pursuant to Decision No. 2021-031C of the President of the Commission of March 2, 2021, the CNIL carried out an online control mission the same day, in order to verify the presence of the disputed file online, by looking for it from different search engines. 15. By order of March 4, 2021, the judge of summary proceedings of the court of PARIS ordered ""to SA ORANGE, SAS FREE, SA SFR and SA BOUYGUES TELECOM to implement or have implemented, without delay and for a period of 18 months from this decision all the most suitable and effective targeted surveillance measures likely to ensure the effective blocking of the online public communication service "" \[...\] ""on their networks"". 16. Pursuant to decisions n ° 2021-034C and n ° 2021-035C of the President of the Commission of March 5, 2021, the CNIL carried out on-site control missions to companies \[...\] and \[...\] on March 10 2021. 17. The two laboratories having been concerned by the aforementioned data breach, it was a question of verifying the respect by these two companies of the provisions of the law Informatics and Freedoms and of the RGPD 18. By email of 11 June 2021 addressed to the data protection officer of the companies DEDALUS FRANCE and DEDALUS BIOLOGIE, the CNIL delegation requested additional information from these companies, which were sent on 24 June 2021. 19. For the purpose of examining this file, the President of the Commission a, October 6, 2021, appointed Mr. François PELLEGRINI as rapporteur on the basis of article 39 of decree n ° 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 taken for the application of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended. 20. At the end of his investigation, the rapporteur, on 9 December 2021, had a report notified to DEDALUS BIOLOGIE detailing the shortcomings in the RGPD which he considered to have been in this case. 21. This report proposed that the Commission should be restricted to impose an administrative fine on the company, with regard to the shortcomings set up in Articles 28 (3), 29 and 32 of the RGPD. He also proposed that the sanction decision be made public, but that it is no longer possible to identify the company by name after the expiration of two years from its publication. 22. By letter dated 10 December 2021, the company, through its board, requested additional time to provide its comments in response. By letter dated 15 December 2021, the president of the restricted formation granted him additional time until 24 January 2022. 23. On January 24, 2022, the company produced comments in response to the sanction report. 24. The rapporteur responded to the company's comments on February 7, 2022. A letter was also given to the company, informing it that the file was on the agenda of the restricted formation of March 10, 2022. 25. On February 21, 2022, the company produced new comments in response to those of the rapporteur. 26. The company and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the restricted training session. II. Motifs de la décision A. On the quality of society with regard to the treatments in question 27. Under Article 4 of the GPPD, the controller is defined as ""the natural or legal person, public authority, the service or another organization that, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing "" (point 7) and the subcontractor is ""the natural or legal person, public authority, the service or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller "" (point 8). 28. The rapporteur notes that DEDALUS BIOLOGIE markets software solutions for medical analysis laboratories. As part of the service it offers to laboratories, society does, on the one hand, that make the tools available to laboratories, especially IT, to facilitate the implementation of treatments and, on the other hand, acts only in the name and under the responsibility of the laboratories for software maintenance and, if applicable, migration to other software for example. The company must therefore be regarded as acting as a subcontractor for laboratories within the meaning of Article 4 (8) of the GBER according to the rapporteur. 29. In defense, the company does not dispute the rapporteur's analysis on this point. 30. The restricted formation considers that the concepts of controller and processor must be the subject of a concrete assessment taking into account all the elements making it possible to attribute one or the other of these qualities to a entity. As such, it notes that it appears from the information communicated to the CNIL that the company DEDALUS BIOLOGIE acts as a subcontractor of the treatments implemented on behalf of its customers, laboratories, who are responsible for treatment, insofar as it provides laboratories with IT tools enabling them to implement their treatments and that it acts, in general, only on the basis of their instructions. 31. It is therefore up to the restricted panel to examine, in the light of this quality, the complaints made by the rapporteur against the company. B. On breaches with regard to the RGPD 1. Failure to supervise the processing carried out on behalf of the controller by a formal legal act 32. Under section 28, paragraph 3, of the RGPD, ""Treatment by a subcontractor is governed by a contract or other legal act under Union law or the law of a Member State, which binds the processor to the controller, defines the object and duration of treatment, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and the categories of data subjects, and the obligations and rights of the controller. This contract or other legal act provides, in particular, that the subcontractor: at) only processes personal data on documented instruction from the controller, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or to an international organization, unless he is required to do so under Union law or the law of the Member State to which the subcontractor is subject ; in that case, the subcontractor informs the controller of the treatment of this legal obligation before processing, unless the law concerned prohibits such information for important reasons of public interest ; b) ensure that persons authorized to process personal data undertake to respect confidentiality or are subject to an appropriate legal obligation of confidentiality; c) take all measures required under article 32; d) comply with the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 for recruiting another subcontractor; \[...\] "". 33. The rapporteur considers that it appears from the elements transmitted by the company DEDALUS BIOLOGIE that the various documents framing the contractual relations between the subcontracting company and the laboratories do not include the information required by article 28 of the RGPD. It notes that the general conditions of sale proposed by DEDALUS BIOLOGY at the time when the laboratories accept its service do not contain any of the information required by this article. Likewise, it notes that the required information does not appear either in the maintenance contracts concluded between the company and the laboratories, as transmitted to the CNIL 34. In defense, if the company does not dispute the materiality of the breach of article 28 of the GPPD, it specifies that the conclusion of a subcontracting contract constitutes an obligation both for the controller and for the processor. It concludes that DEDALUS BIOLOGIE cannot be held solely responsible for this failure. It also insists on the efforts made to comply with the RGPD from 2018 and indicates that new models of subcontracting contract meeting the requirements of article 28 are being deployed. 35. Firstly, the restricted training notes that the fact that the obligation resulting from Article 28 (3) of the GBER rests both with the controller and with the processor has no bearing on the existence of a responsibility own of the subcontractor. It notes that it is the company itself which transmits to the laboratories its own general conditions of sale which act as contractual framework under the RGPD 36. Secondly, the restricted formation notes that the general conditions of sale proposed by DEDALUS BIOLOGIE at the time when the laboratories accept its service, transmitted by the company as part of the control procedure, do not include any of the information required by article 28 of the RGPD. Likewise, it notes that the required information does not appear either in the maintenance contracts sent to the CNIL, concluded between the company and the laboratories. By way of illustration, the maintenance contract concluded between NETIKA SAS (old name of DEDALUS BIOLOGIE) and society \[...\] September 13, 2019, certainly includes a part dedicated to personal data, but which does not meet the requirements of article 28 of the RGPD and covers obsolete provisions of the IT and Freedom law. The restricted training also notes that the example of an assistance and maintenance contract, submitted by the company to the CNIL delegation during the on-site inspection of March 1, 2021, also does not contain the mandatory information under Article 28 of the GSPD. If it contains a part dedicated to personal data, this does not meet the requirements of this article. 37. Third, the restricted formation notes that the company DEDALUS BIOLOGIE has deployed new models of subcontracting contract and has taken steps to comply with the provisions of article 28 of the GSPD. However, the fact remains that the company initiated proceedings with its customers in the context of these proceedings and that it was not in compliance at the time of the findings made by the CNIL. It is still not in the case of certain contracts, since the company has indicated, in his last observations, continue its actions aimed at transmitting updated contracts to all of its customers and negotiating them if necessary. 38. Consequently, in the light of all these elements, the restricted formation considers that these facts constitute a breach of Article 28 (3) of the GBER, which the company does not dispute, moreover. 2. Sur le manquement à l’obligation pour le sous-traitant de ne traiter les données à caractère personnel que sur instruction du responsable de traitement 39. Under Article 29 of the GDPR, ""The subcontractor and any person acting under the authority of the controller or under that of the processor, who has access to personal data, cannot process this data, except on the instruction of the controller, unless required to do so by Union law or the law of a Member State. "". 40. The rapporteur notes that DEDALUS BIOLOGIE has extracted a larger volume of data than that required in the context of the migration requested by its customers, laboratories \[...\] and \[...\]. The rapporteur concludes that DEDALUS BIOLOGIE has processed data beyond the instructions given by the controllers, which constitutes a breach of Article 29 of the GSPD 41. In defense, the company specifies that the extraction tool available on the old DXLAB ONE software, used for these migrations, only allowed a total extraction of the patient file from the laboratory concerned, without the possibility of adding filters on the fields to be exported to extract only some. It adds that DEDALUS BIOLOGIE operated the migration of data from its customers to a new software solution in accordance with their instructions, since once the data file to be migrated has been established, the company always requested validation of the laboratory concerned before carrying out the migration. The company concludes that it has carried out the extraction operations necessary for migration and that the perimeter of the data to be migrated has been defined as such in accordance with the instructions of the laboratories concerned and taking into account the technical limitations of the tools used at the time to perform these migrations. 42. In its last observations in response, the company indicates that it ""does not intend to undermine the reality of its failure to carry out the processing of personal data, as a subcontractor, only on the only instructions from the controller. "". However, it recalls the significant investments made by the company over the past several years to develop new software solutions in particular. She adds that it is precisely because she was aware of the obsolete nature of MEGABUS software and associated migration tools that she set out to develop a more innovative solution that respects the requirements of RGPD and that is how 'she offered to her customers, from 2018, to switch to KALISIL software . 43. First, restricted training notes that, as will be established below, the various elements collected within the framework of laboratory controls \[...\] and \[...\] have established that DEDALUS BIOLOGIE has extracted a larger volume of data than that required for the migration requested by its customers. 44. Regarding the laboratory \[...\] the on-site inspection report mentions that the latter requested, ""according to the recommendations of DEDALUS"", data migration from the MEGABUS solution (also called DXLAB ONE) to the KALISIL solution for patients who carried out a medical analysis after May 7, 2017. However, the data extracted by DEDALUS BIOLOGIE for this migration included 8,403 lines relating to patients whose date of last visit was before May 7, 2017, which represents 6.5% of the total volumetricity. 45. Regarding the laboratory \[...\] restricted training notes that, as part of a software change, the laboratory asked DEDALUS BIOLOGIE to extract the patient database contained in the DXLAB ONE software in order to migrate to other software edited and maintained by a third company. To this end, the company \[...\] has provided DEDALUS with a list of fields to be extracted in order to be imported into the new software solution. The columns ""comment P"" (containing information such as ""100% STERILITY"", etc.) and ""comment D"" (containing information such as ""TUBERCULOSE OSSEOUS UNDER RIFATER"", ""XARELTO"" (medicine), ""DIABETE"", etc.) were also extracted, although they were not included in the list of fields to be extracted. 46. Thus, the restricted formation concludes that the data extracted by the company DEDALUS BIOLOGIE, including in particular the columns ""comment P"" and ""comment D"" which should not have been, cover a wider field than the request of the controller. treatment. 47. Secondly, restricted training notes that, with regard to the validation of extractions by the laboratories concerned, the company produces only two documents entitled ""SAV tickets"" in support of its statements, which are not in reality sufficient to demonstrate that it carried out the extraction operations in accordance with laboratory instructions and that the laboratories have validated the content of the extractions carried out. These ""SAV tickets"" only allow reports of steps taken by the company DEDALUS to be sent to two laboratories to send files with extractions and in no way demonstrate a validation that would have been given by the laboratories concerned. 48. The restricted formation also notes that the company claims, in the case of \[...\], to have had ""a"" return of email ""confirming the conformity of the said file with the instructions of the laboratory"". This statement is inaccurate since, according to the ""SAV ticket"", the ""return of mail"" comes from the company \[...\], a third-party company publishing and now another software to which the extracted data had to be migrated. Thus, this email cannot be valid validation of the extraction by the customer, insofar as the company \[...\] is a third company. 49. Third, the restricted formation considers that the company cannot rely on an unsuitable tool to justify having exceeded the instructions of the controllers. It could, for example, have opted for another tool allowing it to comply with the instructions given by its customers, as it indicates now, or at least deleted all the data which should not have been extracted. 50. Given these elements, the restricted formation considers that the company DEDALUS BIOLOGIE has processed data beyond the instructions given by the data controllers, which constitutes a breach of article 29 of the GSPD 3. Failure to comply with the obligation to ensure data security 51. Under Article 32 of the GPD, ""1. Given the state of knowledge, implementation costs and nature, range, the context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks, whose degree of probability and severity varies, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a level of security adapted to the risk, including among others, as required : a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data; b) means to guarantee the constant confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; c) means to restore the availability of personal data and access to it within an appropriate timeframe in the event of a physical or technical incident d) a procedure aimed at regularly testing, analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the safety of treatment. 2. When assessing the appropriate level of security, particular account is taken of the risks posed by the processing, resulting in particular from destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of personal data transmitted, kept or otherwise treated, or unauthorized access to such data, accidentally or unlawfully \[...\] "". 52. The rapporteur notes that, as early as March 2020, a former employee of DEDALUS BIOLOGIE had brought security problems to his employer. According to the rapporteur, it is established that he had indeed made relevant alerts, which emerges from internal exchanges between \[...\]. 53. The rapporteur then notes that, November 4, 2020, the National Information Systems Security Agency (below ""ANSSI"") observed only data from laboratory patients \[...\] were sold on the darknet, Internet sub-network with anonymization functions and in which not all resources are necessarily indexed by search engines. ANSSI has transmitted to the laboratory concerned a file containing 56 lines with personal data of its patients. The same day, the file as well as the ANSSI email were transmitted to the company DEDALUS BIOLOGIE by the director of network information systems \[...\], within which the laboratory \[...\] appears. 54. The rapporteur then notes that, on 23 February 2021, the confidential information of nearly 500,000 patients was disseminated on the Internet. As of February 24, 2021, the company DEDALUS BIOLOGIE mandated the company \[...\] to carry out a mission of Forensic analysis. The said company issued its investigation report on March 26, 2021. 55. The rapporteur further notes that, under the terms of its investigations, DEDALUS BIOLOGIE has established a correspondence between the data in the file transmitted by the ANSSI and the data present on an FTP server hosted on the MEGABUS telemaintenance server (MEGAEXT) . About 90% of the personal data in the file subject to the violation, published on the Internet in February 2021, was present on the FTP MEGABUS (MEGAEXT) server. 56. According to the rapporteur, numerous technical and organizational shortcomings in terms of security were noted during CNIL controls and can be found against DEDALUS BIOLOGIE. He noted in particular the absence of a specific procedure with regard to data migration operations, the absence of encryption of personal data stored on the FTP MEGABUS server, the absence of automatic erasure of data after migration to other software, the lack of authentication required from the Internet to access the public area of the FTP MEGABUS server, the use of user accounts shared between several employees with regard to the private area of this same server and the absence of a supervision procedure and the rise of security alerts on the server. 57. The rapporteur concludes that, despite prior alerts, DEDALUS BIOLOGIE has not implemented satisfactory security measures to frame the FTP MEGABUS server, which not only allowed access to the data concerned by unauthorized third parties, but also the disclosure on forums of a file containing the medico-administrative data of nearly 500,000 people. 58. In defense, the company reports, with regard to the data breach that took place in February 2021, than the investigations carried out by the company \[...\] have concluded that there are intrusions on the DEDALUS BIOLOGY FTP server. However, it specifies that, although the report notes that 90% of the content of the file circulating on the Internet was also available on the FTP server, it should be noted that, a contrario, the report of \[...\] said that about 10% of the file circulating on the Internet (or about 43,000 records) was not on the FTP server and that approximately 50% of the data on the FTP server was not in the file circulating on the Internet. DEDALUS BIOLOGIE concludes that ""in view of the remaining inconsistencies between the data present on the FTP server and those which have circulated on the Internet, the combined investigations of Dedalus Biologie and \[...\] which ended on March 26, 2021, did not allow the facts at the time to conclude with certainty that the said intrusions were at the origin of the cyber attack carried over by the press. "". Finally, the company reports on the various security measures put in place since then. 59. In his last comments in response, the company indicates that it does not intend to contradict the observations made by the rapporteur on the absence of satisfactory security measures framing the FTP MEGABUS server and specifies that it is aware of the defects of the old technology used by its teams, but again highlights developments in security and its significant compliance efforts. 60. Firstly, the restricted formation notes that it appears from the findings made by the CNIL that the company did not have a specific procedure established with regard to data migration operations. No security measures were planned in particular for sending the data, however sensitive within the meaning of Article 9 of the GSPD. Data extraction files were therefore sent ""clear"" (that is to say readable directly, because not previously transformed via a hash function) without any encryption or security measures. However, to ensure the security of migration operations with such a large number of sensitive personal data, specific procedures should be put in place to describe step by step the sequence of tasks to be performed, the roles and associated responsibilities. Such procedures also provide a detailed account of operations for laboratories or customers whose data has been processed and transmitted. The absence of such procedures poses an easily avoidable risk of compromise on the personal data concerned, which can lead to the presentation of privacy data. 61. Secondly, the restricted formation notes that several successive alerts should have led the company to carry out investigations into its security system. Yes, with regard to the report made by the ANSSI in November 2020, the company indicates that it has undertaken internal investigations to identify the possible source of compromise and that it has implemented several corrective and preventive actions, it did not carry out sufficient diligence to identify whether the data from other laboratories could have been compromised and whether existing vulnerabilities were at the origin of the compromise. The restricted formation considers that the company did not take into account the security problems it encountered at the time, which ended up leading to the data breach of February 2021 which concerned nearly 500,000 people. 62. Third, the restricted formation notes that several basic safety measures were lacking in this case. The restricted training first notes that the personal data stored on the FTP MEGABUS server were not encrypted and were therefore directly legible, whereas these are sensitive data which, by their nature, require measures specific security. 63. In addition, as part of the migrations from DXLAB ONE software to another software, the data, once transferred to the server, was not automatically deleted. However, the conservation of the data incurs a risk of leakage or compromise of said data. 64. The restricted formation then notes that the public area of the server, in which certain laboratory data were stored for migration purposes, was freely accessible without authentication from the Internet. It was not until November 4, 2020, the date on which the security incident was reported by the ANSSI, that ""anonymous"" access without authentication to the FTP server was cut and, on February 23, 2021 only, that this server was definitively switched off. In addition, the private area of the server was accessible with user accounts shared between several employees. However, the use of shared accounts poses a disproportionate, yet easily avoidable, risk to the security of treatment and considerably increases the risk of compromise, in particular due to the circulation of the password between several people. In addition, joint (or shared) accounts do not allow a good application of the enabling policy, which is nevertheless a fundamental element of the security of information systems, aimed at limiting access to only data that a user has need. 65. The restricted formation finally underlines that no procedure for supervision and reporting of security alerts was implemented on the FTP server. Connections from suspicious IP addresses were therefore neither detected nor processed. The company's digital investigation report \[...\] confirms that some suspicious connections have been identified, which confirms that the server was exposed on the Internet and that unauthorized connections to this server took place, without them being identified through these supervision and alert procedures. 66. Lastly, the restricted formation notes that the alleged breach does not consist of data breaches as such, but by the security flaws that are causing the intrusion on the company's servers, noted during the checks carried out by the CNIL. It underlines that this rapporteur's proposal, aimed at punishing security breaches that cause violations, is in line with previous decisions of the restricted training. So, in its deliberation n ° SAN 2019-007 of July 18, 2019, the restricted formation noted ""that the basic security measures had not been taken before the development of its website \[by the sanctioned company\] which made possible the occurrence of the personal data breach "". 67. The restricted formation stresses, however, that the consequences of these safety deficiencies are not excluded from the scope of its analysis, in that they reveal the realization of the risk caused by these safety defects. The restricted formation thus observes that the existing vulnerabilities have been exploited and that several data violations have taken place: intrusions on the FTP server, followed by the dissemination of a file containing the medico-administrative data of nearly 500,000 people on forums in February 2021. In this regard, the restricted formation notes that the intrusions on the FTP server are proven and that they are not disputed by the company, these having been established by the investigations carried out by \[...\] on behalf of the company. 68. Regarding the dissemination of the file on forums, if the company indicates that it cannot be concluded with certainty that the intrusions on the FTP server are at the origin of the data breach which led to the dissemination of this file, the restricted formation nevertheless observes that it appears from the elements of the file that approximately 90% of the data in the published file were present on the FTP server. The file distributed on the forums contains in particular comments which should not have been extracted by DEDALUS BIOLOGIE in the context from the migration from the MEGABUS solution to another solution (""comment P"" and ""comment D"" mentioned above). These different elements tend to show the link between the data in the file accessible on the Internet and that which was on the FTP server 69. So, the lack of security measures to protect the server in question - including the lack of encryption, the absence of automatic erasure of data after their migration, the lack of authentication required from the Internet to access the public server area and the use of shared user accounts - has led to making this data accessible to third parties, despite alerts prior to the personal data breach that led to the disclosure of a file containing the medical and administrative data of nearly 500,000 people. 70. Consequently, the restricted formation considers that the company DEDALUS BIOLOGIE has breached its obligation resulting from the provisions of article 32 of the Regulation, which the company does not dispute, moreover. III. Sur la sanction et la publicité 71. Under III of article 20 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended, ""When the controller or his processor does not comply with the obligations resulting from the regulations (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or of this law, the president of the National Commission for Information Technology and Freedoms can also, if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, if necessary in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, enter the restricted formation of the commission with a view to delivery, after adversarial procedure, one or more of the following: \[...\] 7 ° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the annual worldwide turnover total for the previous year, whichever is greater. In the cases mentioned in 5 and 6 of article 83 of regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted formation takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83 "". 72. Article 83 of the GSPD provides that ""each supervisory authority shall ensure that the administrative fines imposed under this article for violations of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive "", before specifying the elements to be taken into account when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and when deciding on the amount of this fine. 73. First, on the principle of fining, the company insists in defense on the absence of violation committed previously, on its important cooperation with the CNIL, on the remedial measures implemented since the personal data breach and on the significant compliance efforts undertaken. 74. Restricted training recalls that it must take into account, for the imposition of an administrative fine, criteria specified in section 83 of the GTRD, such as the nature and gravity of the violation, the number of people affected and the level of damage they suffered, the fact that the violation was committed negligently, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by the persons concerned, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and the categories of personal data concerned by the breach. 75. The restricted training notes, first of all, the numerous security faults framing the FTP MEGABUS server, which was insufficiently protected, which led to a massive personal data breach: a large amount of data concerning 491,840 people were disclosed . 76. The restricted formation insists, moreover, on the extremely damaging nature of the violation for the persons concerned, insofar as, in addition to civil status data (civility, surname, first name), postal, electronic and telephone contact details, very sensitive data have been disclosed. The file subject to the personal data breach contains indeed references relating to HIV infection, cancer or genetic diseases, pregnancy, drug treatments followed by patients or even genetic data. The data concerned by the violation are health data, which are particular categories of data within the meaning of Article 9 of the GSPD (known as ""sensitive"" data). Given the nature of the data concerned, the restricted formation considers that the company should have been particularly vigilant with regard to the security of such data, to prevent them from being reused by unauthorized third parties, thus harming those affected by the data breach. However, the negligence committed in matters of security has been multiple and particularly serious, while the company deals with sensitive data and has already been alerted to the potential existence of risks, some of which have occurred. The restricted formation considers that the breach which led to the data breach is of a particular gravity. 77. It also underlines that with regard to the nature of these personal data, those affected by the violation are prime targets for phishing (""phishing"") personalized (sending false messages or false documents to retrieve personal information or money) : potential pirates now have their social security number, from the name of their prescribing doctor, the date of their examination, the name of the laboratory or even, in some cases, medical information. The nature of the personal data compiled also underpins the risk of identity theft, false prescriptions (which can use the names of doctors), dummy distress messages containing the health problems mentioned. 78. The restricted formation finally notes that the company has not taken any specific measures to stop the distribution of the file once it has been aware of it. It was the president of the CNIL, and not the company DEDALUS BIOLOGIE, who had an interim assignment issued so that the disputed file could be effectively blocked. 79. If the restricted formation notes that the company cooperated throughout the procedure with the services of the CNIL, it considers that safety deficiencies, which enabled the data breach to be carried out , including both intrusions on the FTP server and online file distribution, result from negligence in the basic security rules of information systems which has led to the making of personal data processed by the company accessible to unauthorized third parties. 80. Restricted training also notes that, the fact that DEDALUS BIOLOGY processed personal data beyond the instructions given by the controllers and therefore committed a breach of Article 29 of the GPD contributed to aggravating the violation, since comments which should not have been extracted were then found in the file distributed online and accessible on the forums. 81. The restricted formation finally recalls that the various documents framing the contractual relations between the company DEDALUS BIOLOGIE and the laboratories do not include the information required by article 28 of the RGPD, which is also not such as to ensure effective protection of personal data processed through contractual guarantees. 82. Consequently, the restricted formation considers that an administrative fine should be imposed in the light of the breaches of Articles 28, paragraph 3, 29 and 32 of the GSPD 83. Secondly, with regard to the amount of the fine, the company emphasizes that \[...\]. The company insists that the financial situation of the company must be taken into account, so that the fine imposed is adapted to the contributory capacities of the controller. 84. The restricted formation recalls that paragraph 3 of article 83 of the Regulation provides that in the event of multiple violations, as is the case here, the total amount of the fine may not exceed the amount fixed for the most serious violation. Insofar as the company is accused of a breach of Articles 28, 29 and 32 of the GBER, the maximum amount of the fine that can be retained amounts to 10 million euros or 2% of annual turnover worldwide, whichever is greater. 85. The restricted formation also recalls that administrative fines must be dissuasive but proportionate. It considers in particular that the activity of the company and its financial situation must be taken into account for the determination of the penalty and in particular, in the event of an administrative fine, its amount. As such, it notes that the company reports a turnover of 18.8 million euros in 2019 and 16.3 million euros in 2020, for a net result amounting to 2,226,949 euros in 2019 and 1,437,017 euros in 2020. 86. In view of these elements, the restricted formation considers that the imposition of a fine of 1,500,000 euros appears justified. 87. Thirdly, with regard to the publicity of the sanction, the company indicates that the cyber attack which implicated it was the subject of a very important publicity, since several press articles were published, then relayed so much in paper and television press, in France and abroad. The incident was also the subject of several communications from the CNIL. She adds that this media coverage will have particularly harmful effects for her, not only in the context of her activity, but also on her turnover. 88. Given the gravity of the shortcomings committed, particularly the shortcomings relating to security, the number of people concerned and the consequences for them, the restricted formation considers that the publicity of the decision is justified.

Facts and procedure 1. TOTALENERGIES ELECTRICITÉ ET GAZ FRANCE (hereinafter ""the company""), formerly known as TOTAL DIRECT ENERGIE, whose registered office is located at 2 bis rue Louis Armand in Paris (75015), is a public limited company whose business is the supply and production of electricity and gas in France. Founded in 2003, the company has approximately 650 employees. 2. For the year 2020, the company achieved a turnover of \[…\] euros, for a net result of \[…\] euros. In 2021, the company had nearly 8 million customers and prospects, which ranked it third among the main electricity and gas suppliers in France. 3. Between October 2019 and July 2020, the National Commission for Computing and Liberties (hereinafter ""the CNIL"" or ""the Commission"") received 27 complaints against of the society. Of these complaints, 18 were examined in the context of this sanction procedure. The complainants notably mentioned the difficulties encountered in exercising their rights of access or opposition to receiving commercial prospecting telephone calls. 4. For the purposes of investigating complaints, an online check was carried out on the ""total.direct-energie.com"" website on August 10, 2020. Minutes No. 2020-113-1, drawn up by the delegation on the day of the inspection, was notified to the company on August 19, 2020. The CNIL delegation focused in particular on verifying the management, by the company, of the rights of individuals, and more particularly the way in which it had dealt with requests for the exercise of the rights of persons who had lodged complaints with the Commission. This control was also intended to verify the information provided by the company to prospects contacted in the context of cold-calling operations as well as the possibility offered to them of being able to oppose it. 5. Three requests for additional information were then sent to the company by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, dated August 19, 2020, November 25, 2020 and February 19, 2021. The company replied by letters dated October 1, 2020, December 11, 2020 and March 5, 2021. 6. For the purpose of examining these elements, the President of the Commission, on July 29, 2021, appointed Mr François PELLEGRINI as rapporteur on the basis of Article 22 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended. 7. By letter dated January 6, 2022, the rapporteur asked the company to provide its balance sheet for the year 2020, which it did not do. 8. On February 25, 2022, the rapporteur notified the company of a report detailing the breaches of the GDPR that he considered to have occurred in this case, accompanied by a notice to attend the restricted training session of April 21, 2022. 9. This report proposed that the restricted committee of the Commission impose an administrative fine and an injunction to bring the processing into compliance with the provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the Post and Electronic Telecommunications Code (CPCE) and of Articles 12, 14, 15 and 21 of the GDPR, together with a penalty payment for each day of delay at the end of a period of three months following the notification of the deliberation of the restricted formation. He also proposed that this decision be made public, but that it would no longer be possible to identify the company by name after the expiry of a period of two years from its publication. 10. On March 25, 2022, the company filed its observations in response to the sanction report. The company and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the restricted committee session. I. Reasons for decision A. On the breach of the obligations of Article L. 34-5 of the Postal and Electronic Communications Code 11. According to article L. 34-5 of the CPCE: "" Direct prospecting by means of an automated electronic communications system within the meaning of 6° of Article L. 32, a fax machine or e-mails using the contact details of a natural person, subscriber or user, who does not has not previously expressed its consent to receive direct prospecting by this means. (…) / However, direct prospecting by e-mail is authorized if the contact details of the recipient have been collected from him, in compliance with the provisions of the law n° 78-17 of January 6, 1978 relating to data processing, files and freedoms, on the occasion of a sale or the provision of services, if the direct prospecting concerns similar products or services provided by the same natural or legal person, and if the recipient is offered, in an express and unambiguous manner, the possibility of objecting, free of charge, except for those linked to the transmission of the refusal, and in a simple manner , to the use of his contact details at the time they are collected and each time a prospecting e-mail is sent to him in the event that he has not refused such use from the outset. (…) "". 12. The rapporteur first observes that during the inspection carried out on August 10, 2020, the company indicated to the CNIL that it was carrying out different types of commercial prospecting campaigns, including so-called ""relaunch"" campaigns during which it contacts in particular prospects who have communicated their data through forms available on its website. Prospects can be contacted by phone or email. 13. The rapporteur then notes that the delegation of control noted that, when subscribing online on the company's website, the user must fill in the corresponding collection form with his email address and telephone number below the statement informing him that: ""By providing the following information, you acknowledge that you agree to their use by Total Direct Energie to subsequently present its offers to you"". He emphasizes that this mention is not accompanied by any modality, such as a checkbox, allowing the user to oppose the use of his contact details for such purposes, at the time when these are collected. 14. In defence, the company provides answers in connection with two forms available on its website. It first argues that the online quote request form complies with the applicable rules in that it informs the user that his contact details are provided on an optional basis and that it contains a checkbox, not pre-checked by default, allowing him to accept to receive commercial offers from the company by email, SMS or telephone. The company also maintains that Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE is not intended to apply to the online subscription form since telephone calls and emails sent to persons who have not finalized their subscription are not in principle intended to promote the company's products or services but are intended to offer assistance to the user in order to help him finalize his current subscription. However, the company specifies that it has taken measures within the framework of the sanction procedure to add a checkbox to this form and adds that it no longer sends, since September 2020, emails to people who start an online subscription without finalizing it. 15. Firstly, the Restricted Committee notes that, with regard to the quote request form, the rapporteur specified during the procedure that its conformity was not disputed, only the online subscription form being referred to in its report. It also considers that the methods of data collection through this quote request form comply with the applicable rules. 16. Secondly, with regard to the online subscription form, the Restricted Committee recalls that it follows from the aforementioned provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE that data controllers may, on the occasion of a sale or provision of services, collect personal data for commercial prospecting purposes for similar products or services, without obtaining the consent of the interested parties, subject to collection in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection Act et Libertés, carried out with the person concerned and offering him the possibility of opposing such processing of data at the time they are collected, then during each prospecting message. 17. In this case, the Restricted Committee considers that the fact that the user, when he completes the online subscription form, cannot oppose the use of his data for the purposes of electronic commercial prospecting, when they are collected, constitutes a breach of the obligations of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE when the form informs him that the information provided, including his email address, can be used by the company to to ""present its offers at a later date"". 18. Under these conditions, the Restricted Committee considers that the company has failed to comply with its obligations resulting from Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE. 19. It nevertheless notes that, in the context of this procedure, the company indicated that it no longer sent emails to persons starting a subscription without finalizing it and inserted a checkbox on the online subscription form accompanied by the mention following: ""Please tick this box if you do not wish your telephone number to be used by TotalEnergies Electricité and Gaz de France to help you finalize your subscription and offer you its offers and services"". B. On the breach of the obligation to inform pursuant to Article 14 of the GDPR 20. According to Article 14 of the GDPR: 1. Where personal data has not been collected from the data subject, the controller shall provide the data subject with all of the following information: a) The identity and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller's representative; b) Where applicable, the contact details of the data protection officer; c) The purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing; d) The categories of personal data concerned; e) Where applicable, the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data; f) If applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a recipient in a third country or an international organization (…) / 2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the data subject with the following information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing vis-à-vis the data subject (…) / a) the period for which the personal data will be stored or, where this is not possible, the criteria used to determine this period; b) where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party; c) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to personal data, rectification or erasure thereof, or restriction of processing relating to the person concerned, as well as the right to s object to processing and the right to data portability; d) where the processing is based on Article 6, paragraph 1, point a), or on Article 9, paragraph 2, point a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without prejudice the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent given before its withdrawal; e) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; f) the source from which the personal data originated and, where appropriate, a statement indicating whether or not they originated from sources accessible to the public (…)” According to Article 14, paragraph 3: ""The controller shall provide the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2: (a) within a reasonable period of time after obtaining the personal data, but not exceeding one month, having regard to the particular circumstances in which the personal data is processed; b) if the personal data is to be used for the purposes of communication with the data subject, at the latest at the time of the first communication to said person (…)”. 21. The rapporteur notes that, as part of the check, the company provided the CNIL delegation with a sample consisting of eighty-four recordings of telephone calls made by three advisers on October 20, 2020. These calls were carried out as part of prospecting campaigns carried out using data collected by the company from its partners providing prospect data. 22. The rapporteur notes that the listening to this sample revealed the absence of information provided to people contacted by telephone or the incomplete nature of this information. Indeed, it appears from these recordings that, in some cases, the people contacted did not receive any information relating to the protection of their data during the call. In other cases, the information provided was incomplete, some of the aforementioned information provided for in Article 14 of the GDPR not being brought to the attention of the persons contacted. Finally, the company offered no possibility to the people contacted to access more complete information, for example by activating a key on their telephone keypad. 23. In defence, the company first emphasizes that the calls examined in the report do not reflect the practices of all the advisers since it concerns only eighty-four call recordings and that they correspond to calls for which the advisers did not follow the instructions given. These instructions, however, made it possible to provide the persons concerned with the ""essential / priority information"" according to the company. The company then adds that it modified, as part of the procedure, the script provided to advisers, in order to highlight more the essential information at the start of the call and to invite people who wish to have more information, by pressing a key on the phone. The company also indicates that it has reinforced its second level of information by recording a message containing all the information required by article 14 of the GDPR, accessible from this button. Finally, it specifies that its agents had to attend awareness training on this subject. 24. The Restricted Committee notes that the eighty-four recordings of canvassing calls collected as part of the check reveal a lack of knowledge of Article 14 of the GDPR. 25. The Restricted Committee observes that, in some cases, the people contacted for prospecting purposes did not receive any information. In other cases, certain information mentioned above provided for in Article 14 of the GDPR – such as the purposes of the processing or the existence of the various rights – was not brought to their attention. In most cases, essential information, such as that relating to the very principle of recording the call and the right to oppose it, was not communicated. People were also not offered the possibility of obtaining more complete information relating to the processing of their personal data, for example by pressing a key on their telephone keypad. 26. Therefore, the Restricted Committee considers that the aforementioned facts constitute a breach of Article 14 of the GDPR. 27. The Restricted Committee notes that the company has justified having taken measures to comply during the procedure, in particular by modifying the instructions contained in the script provided to advisers contacting prospects, and detailing the message to be delivered to them at the start of the call. This mentions all the essential information, as well as the possibility of obtaining additional information relating to the processing of personal data implemented by the company by pressing a key on the telephone keypad. The information thus made available to individuals complies with Article 14 of the GDPR. 2 On breaches in connection with the exercise of rights 28. Under Article 12 of the GDPR: ""1. The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 as well as to carry out any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 in relation to the processing to the person concerned in a concise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible manner, in clear and simple terms, in particular for any information intended specifically for a child. The information is provided in writing or by other means including, when is appropriate, by electronic means.When the data subject requests it, the information may be provided orally, provided that the identity of the data subject is demonstrated by other means. 2. The controller shall facilitate the exercise of the rights conferred on the data subject under Articles 15 to 22. In the cases referred to in Article 11(2), the controller shall not refuse to act on the request of the data subject to exercise the rights conferred on him by Articles 15 to 22, unless the controller demonstrates that he is unable to identify the data subject. 3. The controller shall provide the data subject with information on the measures taken following a request made pursuant to Articles 15 to 22, as soon as possible and in any case within one month. from receipt of the request. If necessary, this period may be extended by two months, taking into account the complexity and the number of requests. The controller informs the data subject of this extension and the reasons for the postponement within one month of receiving the request. Where the data subject submits the request in electronic form, the information shall be provided electronically where possible, unless the data subject requests otherwise. 4. If the controller does not comply with the request made by the data subject, he shall inform the latter without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request of the reasons for his refusal. inaction and the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and of lodging a judicial remedy. (…) "". 29. Article 15(1) of the GDPR provides the right for a person to obtain confirmation from the controller whether personal data relating to him or her are being processed and, where they are, the access to personal data concerning him and in particular ""g) when the personal data are not collected from the person concerned, any information available as to their source"". It is also provided in paragraph 3 of the same article that ""the data controller provides a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. (…)"". 30. Under Article 21 of the GDPR: 2. Where personal data is processed for prospecting purposes, the data subject has the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning him or her for such prospecting purposes, including profiling. insofar as it is linked to such prospecting. (…)"" 1. On the breach of obligations relating to the procedures for exercising the rights of individuals (Article 12 of the GDPR) 31. The rapporteur, to propose to the Restricted Committee to consider that the company has breached its obligations resulting from Article 12 of the GDPR, relies on four referrals to the CNIL, from Mesdames \[…\] (complaint no. \[… \]) and \[…\] (complaint no. \[…\]), and of Messrs. \[…\] (complaint no. \[…\]) and \[…\] (complaint no. \[…\]), in the context of which the complainants alleged difficulties encountered in exercising their rights. 32. The rapporteur indicates that these four referrals concern respectively a request for rectification of the consumer's address, the taking into account of an opposition to the processing of data for commercial prospecting purposes, a request for the origin of the data and finally a opposition to the processing of data for commercial prospecting purposes accompanied by a request for their deletion. 33. The rapporteur observes that it emerges from the observations made during the inspection procedure or from the information communicated subsequently by the company, that although the latter took the requests into account, it only provided satisfactory responses late in the process, beyond the deadlines set by Article 12 of the GDPR, often after several reminders from the complainant and initiation of the control procedure. 34. In defence, the company argues that the alleged breach under these four referrals only occurred in isolated or complex cases and is essentially indicative of human error, during a period of health crisis and successive confinements during individuals have had more time to exercise their rights. It specifies that, according to the detailed procedure that the company developed in 2018 for the agents of the customer relations department and its partner \[…\] (subcontractor in charge of managing requests for the exercise of rights) , requests must be taken care of immediately and no later than D+1 from their receipt, and they must be processed no later than D+30. It also details the actions taken for each of these referrals and emphasizes that a response has been provided to all these requests. 35. The Restricted Committee recalls that it follows from Article 12 of the GDPR that when a request to exercise a right is addressed to it, the data controller must provide the data subject with information on the measures taken to respond to the request. his request as soon as possible and in any case within one month. The Restricted Committee also recalls that it is possible to extend this period by two months due to the complexity of the request. 36. The Restricted Committee notes that the facts noted by the rapporteur are not disputed by the company. It considers that a breach of the obligations of Article 12 of the GDPR is constituted when the company has not processed certain requests to exercise rights within the time limit, the time taken being up to two years. In the case of a complainant, even though her situation was settled, the company had not informed her of the actual processing of her request. As a result, the persons concerned were unaware of the follow-up to their requests. 37. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that, even though the company has justified having processed the aforementioned requests and having taken measures to comply, the breach of Article 12 of the GDPR has been established. 2. On the breach relating to the obligation to respect the right of access (article 15 of the GDPR) 38. The rapporteur, to propose to the Restricted Committee to consider that the company has breached its obligations resulting from Article 15 of the GDPR in terms of right of access, is based on eight referrals to the CNIL, from Mr. \[…\] \] (complaint no. \[…\]), \[…\] (complaint no. \[…\]), \[…\] (complaint no. \[…\]), \[…\] (complaint no. \[…\]), \[…\] ( complaint No \[…\]), \[…\] (complaint No \[…\]), \[…\] (complaint No \[…\]) and \[…\] (complaint No \[…\]). In the context of these complaints, people reported difficulties encountered in exercising this right, even though their requests had been received. 39. The rapporteur indicates that these eight referrals concern in particular access to personal data and more particularly their origin as well as access to recordings of telephone conversations. 40. The rapporteur observes that it emerges from the observations made during the inspection procedure or from the information communicated subsequently that the company did not provide a response to the applicants or provided late or incorrect responses. 41. In defence, the company argues that the procedures it had put in place were not followed due to human error but also a large number of requests received in 2020 as well as a disturbed context related to the health crisis. It states that if it did not consider certain requests for access within the time allowed, it was because of difficulties encountered in obtaining this information from its business partners, so that it found itself in failure to properly inform complainants of the source of their data. The company indicates that it has revised its internal process for managing requests to exercise rights in order to prevent the repetition of such incidents and has reinforced communication with the teams regarding the processing of requests. It argues that after extensive research an answer was able to be given to Messrs \[…\] \[…\] and \[…\] and that it deleted all the data concerning them. 42. The Restricted Committee notes that the company had information relating to the complainants, but that due to internal malfunctions it did not deal satisfactorily with the various requests. It considers that the company cannot rely on its difficulties in obtaining information from its business partners to justify the lack of response provided to applicants in compliance with the applicable provisions. Indeed, the company calls on many commercial partners for the supply of prospect data and it is therefore up to it to organize itself to be able to ensure a rigorously compliant processing of access requests and, in particular , provide information on the origin of the data. These rights constitute a central element of individuals' control over the processing of their personal data. The company could also proceed in several stages to communicate the data it had immediately within one month. 43. The Restricted Committee notes that the facts noted by the rapporteur are not disputed by the company. It considers that a breach of the obligations of Article 15 is constituted for all of the aforementioned complaints since the company has not processed the access requests sent to it within the time limit allocated to it, thus leaving people in the dark about the data processed by the company and concerning them. 44. It notes that, in the context of this procedure, the company has justified having taken measures to comply with the obligations arising from Article 15 of the GDPR. 3. On the breach relating to the obligation to respect the right of opposition (article 21 of the GDPR) 45. The rapporteur, to propose to the Restricted Committee to consider that the company has failed to comply with its obligations resulting from Article 21 of the GDPR, relies on six referrals to the CNIL, from Mesdames \[…\] (complaint no. \[… \]) and \[…\] (complaint no. \[…\]) and of Mr. \[…\] (complaint no. \[…\]), \[…\] (complaint no. \[…\]), \[…\] (complaint no. \[… \]) and \[…\] (complaint No. \[…\]), in which the complainants reported their difficulties in exercising their right to object to commercial prospecting. 46. The rapporteur indicates that these six referrals concern requests for the deletion of data in order to no longer receive commercial prospecting calls and the pursuit of commercial solicitations notwithstanding the exercise of the right to oppose the processing of data for this purpose. 47. The rapporteur observes that it emerges from the observations made during the inspection procedure or from the elements communicated subsequently that the complainants either did not obtain a response to their requests for opposition formulated by registered letters and from which the company had yet acknowledged receipt, on the grounds that they had not been sent to the unit responsible for processing them, or were informed that their requests had been taken into account by the company, which confirmed to them the deletion of their personal data , but without implementing measures to satisfy their opposition requests, since they continued to receive telephone calls in the months following their requests. He adds that for one of the requests to object to the processing of personal data for prospecting purposes, the complainant did not obtain any satisfaction even though it had been received by the company. 48. In defence, the company first argues that the impact on the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned is limited and that these complaints should be put into perspective with the satisfactory treatment of the very many other requests managed by the company. during the year 2020. She then adds that, in these specific cases, the non-compliance with the procedures put in place by the company was due to human errors by agents who did not always have the appropriate reactions and did not did not follow the required procedures. It can also be explained by the disturbed context at the time of the events, due to the health crisis, which upset the organization in place and made exchanges between the company's departments more complex. 49. The company notes that three requests were not sent to the unit responsible for processing them. She acknowledges having received the letters. However, it emphasizes that the fact that the requests were not sent to the dedicated unit and that the person who received the letters was unable to identify their subject, and therefore did not forward them to the dedicated unit, explains their lack of treatment. 50. On this point, the Restricted Committee considers that while it is undisputed that the complainants did not address their requests directly to the unit in charge of responding to them, the fact remains that it belonged to the company, since the requests, one of which was addressed directly to the data protection officer, were indeed received by the latter and that they were clear in their terms, to process them within the time limits provided for by the GDPR and to ensure that they are forwarded to the competent department. Indeed, if the implementation of organizational measures making it possible to facilitate the exercise of the rights of individuals – such as the establishment of this dedicated unit – complies with the requirements and objectives pursued by the GDPR, this cannot, on the other hand, exempt the company of its obligation to respond to requests made to it by mail even if they are not sent to it through the channel provided for this purpose, a fortiori when, as is the case here, the content of the request is clear. 51. The Restricted Committee notes that, even if the company indicates that it took the complainants' requests into account, but did not satisfy them due to human error or technical problems, this does not mean that it provided a satisfactory response as the plaintiffs continued to receive business prospecting telephone calls. 52. The Restricted Committee notes that the facts noted by the rapporteur are not disputed by the company. It considers that a breach of the obligations arising from Article 21 of the GDPR is constituted when the company has not taken into account the opposition of the persons concerned by the processing of their personal data. 53. It notes that, in the context of this procedure, the company has justified having taken measures to comply with the obligations arising from Article 21 of the GDPR. II. On corrective measures and their publicity Under the terms of III of article 20 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended: ""When the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or from this law, the President of the National Commission for Computing and Liberties may also , if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, if necessary in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, seize the restricted formation of the commission with a view to the pronouncement, after adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures: (…) 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of of a company, 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher In the cases mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased, respectively, to 20 thousand lion euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted formation takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83. "" According to Article 83 of the GDPR: ""1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this Article for breaches of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive."", before specify the elements to be taken into account in deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the amount of that fine. 54. Firstly, on the principle of imposing a fine, the company maintains that such a measure is not necessary and would not be proportionate in view of the facts with which it is charged. 55. The Restricted Committee recalls that it must take into account, for the pronouncement of an administrative fine, the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the violation, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and the categories of personal data affected by the breach. 56. The Restricted Committee considers first of all that the company has demonstrated certain negligence with regard to the fundamental principles of the GDPR since five breaches have been established, relating in particular to information and the rights of individuals. The Restricted Committee adds that several shortcomings have given rise to complaints. 57. The Restricted Committee then notes that the company is a particularly important player in the energy production and supply sector since it had approximately 8 million customers and prospects in 2021, which ranked it third energy suppliers in France. It therefore has significant resources enabling it to deal with questions of protection of personal data. 58. The Restricted Committee also observes that the company makes extensive use of commercial prospecting carried out by telephone or e-mail. 59. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that an administrative fine should be imposed with regard to the breaches of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE and Articles 12, 14, 15 and 21 of the GDPR. 60. Secondly, with regard to the amount of the fine, the Restricted Committee recalls that administrative fines must be both dissuasive and proportionate. In this case, the company disregarded its obligations resulting from Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE with regard to the 4.6 million prospects, recorded in September 2020, and for which a subscription, made from online form, was in progress. In addition to the shortcomings linked to the commercial prospecting carried out by the company which were noted in the context of the audit, the Restricted Committee observes that the complaints revealing the existence of shortcomings appear to be few in number - indeed, their number, of eighteen, must be related to the number of customers and prospects of approximately 8 million – so that these shortcomings cannot be regarded as having a systemic character. 61. The Restricted Committee also recalls that the activity of the company and its financial situation must be taken into account when determining the sanction and in particular, in the event of an administrative fine, its amount. It notes in this respect that the company reports a turnover of \[…\] in 2020 for a net result amounting to \[…\] euros. 62. The Restricted Committee also acknowledges the efforts made by the company to comply throughout the procedure. 63. Therefore, in view of these elements, the Restricted Committee considers that the imposition of an administrative fine of one million euros appears justified. 64. Thirdly, an injunction to bring the processing into compliance with the provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE and Articles 12, 14, 15 and 21 of the GDPR was proposed by the rapporteur during the notification of the report. 65. The company maintains that the actions it has taken with regard to all of the breaches identified should lead to the non-compliance with the rapporteur's proposal for an injunction. 66. As indicated above, the Restricted Committee notes that the company has taken measures to bring its processing into compliance with the provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE and Articles 12, 14, 15 and 21 of the GDPR . It therefore considers that there is no need to issue an injunction. 67. Finally, with regard to the publication of the sanction decision, the company argues that such a measure would be disproportionate in view of the limited nature of the alleged breaches and its compliance. It also considers that the publication of the sanction would have a significant impact in terms of image for the company and that it would be favorable to its main competitors, in a very competitive market. The Restricted Committee considers that the publicity of the sanction is justified with regard to the nature of the breaches which relate essentially to the processing of millions of data, carried out within the framework of commercial prospecting campaigns and in particular to the information delivered to the persons concerned, as well as on the procedures for exercising rights. It also considers that this measure will make it possible to inform the persons concerned of the past existence of the breaches sanctioned, insofar as these facts have been the subject of several complaints. FOR THESE REASONS The CNIL Restricted Committee, after having deliberated, decides to: • impose an administrative fine on TOTALENERGIES ELECTRICITÉ ET GAZ FRANCE in the amount of 1,000,000 (one million) euros for breaches of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE and articles 12 , 14, 15 and 21 GDPR; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. President Alexander LINDEN This decision may be appealed to the Council of State within two months of its notification."

For more information: www.cnil.fr/donnees-personnelles. data (DPO) of \[…\] ACCOR having spoken last; The Restricted Committee adopted the following draft decision: I. Facts and procedure 1. ACCOR SA (hereinafter “the company”) is a public limited company with advisory board created in 1960, specializing in the hotel sector. Its head office is located at 82, rue Henri Farman in Issy-les-Moulineaux (92130). 2. In 2021, the company achieved a turnover of \[…\]. In the summer of 2020, 5,100 hotels, established in 110 countries, under 39 different brands, were operated under contracts linking their owners to ACCOR (franchise or “management” contracts, principally). The company employs around 1,500 people. 3. Between December 2018 and September 2019, the National Commission for Computing and freedoms (hereinafter ""the CNIL"" or ""the Commission"") was directly seized of five complaints (referrals no \[…\]) relating to the failure to take into account the right of opposition to receipt by e-mail of commercial prospecting messages (advertising e-mails, e-mails of welcome to the loyalty program, newsletters) from the company. On September 22, 2019, the CNIL also received a complaint (referral No. \[…\]) relating to the difficulties encountered in the framework of the exercise of the right of access in particular to banking data collected by the company when booking a hotel room. 4. In accordance with Article 56 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter “the Regulation” or “the GDPR”), in the context of the processing of complaints received against the company, the CNIL informed, on December 12, 2018, all European supervisory authorities with jurisdiction to act as a supervisory authority leader concerning the cross-border processing implemented by the company, competence drawn by the CNIL from the fact that the main establishment of the company is in France. 5. Through the exchange platform between European data protection authorities, the CNIL has initiated the procedure allowing the supervisory authorities concerned to declare themselves. Ten authorities declared themselves concerned by this procedure, within the meaning of Article 4 (22) of the GDPR. 6. At the same time, between January 2019 and February 2020, the CNIL was made the recipient, as “lead authority”, pursuant to the cooperation mechanisms provided for by the Settlement, of five other complaints received respectively by the supervisory authorities of the Sarre, Spain, Ireland, Poland and Lower Saxony (referrals No \[…\]). These complaints also related to requests to object to data processing personal information for the purposes of commercial prospecting by e-mail and the exercise of the right of access to data collected by ACCOR. 2 7. On March 6, 2019, pursuant to decision no. 2019-046C of February 18, 2019 of the President from the CNIL, a questionnaire was sent to ACCOR, to which the latter responded er by letter of April 8 then by additional letters of May 22, August 1, October 11 and December 27, 2019. The purpose of this documentary control mission was to verify compliance by the company ACCOR of all the provisions of the GDPR and of the law n° 78-17 of 6 January 1978 relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter “the law of January 6, 1978 amended” or the law “Informatique et Libertés”). 8. Following this first check, the CNIL, taking into account the response provided by the company to the instruction letter that had been sent to it and its compliance on several points, submitted to its European counterparts on December 23, 2019, pursuant to Article 60 of the GDPR, a draft decision from its president reminding the company of its obligations, in accordance with the provisions of Article 58.2.b) of the GDPR. 9. This draft decision has been objected to by certain authorities concerned. relevant and reasoned within the meaning of Article 60 of the GDPR, requesting that the company does not only the subject of a call to order but that it is sanctioned by a fine administrative and highlighting, in particular, the number of breaches, the number of complaints and the size of the company. In view of these objections and the new complaints received since the first inspection, the CNIL decided to resume its investigations with the company. 10. On February 11, 2020, the CNIL delegation carried out an inspection mission to the premises of the society. An online check of the company's website (www.all.accor.com) was then carried out on February 24, 2020, pursuant to the aforementioned decision no. 2019-046C. Following these investigations, the company sent additional information to the CNIL by letter in date of February 21, March 10, March 19 and August 7, 2020. 11. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission, on October 16, 2020, appointed Mrs. Sophie LAMBREMON as rapporteur, on the basis of Article 22 of the amended law of January 6, 1978. 12. Following her investigation, the rapporteur notified the company, on November 24, 2020, of a report detailing the breaches of the provisions of articles L. 34-5 of the postal code and electronic communications (hereinafter the “CPCE”) and 12-1, 12-3, 13, 15-1, 21-2 and 32 of GDPR that it considered constituted in this case. This report proposed to the restricted committee to the Commission to impose an administrative fine on the company and that this decision is made public but no longer allows the company to be identified by name the expiration of a period of two years from its publication. 13. Also attached to the report was a summons to the Restricted Committee meeting of 28 January 2021 indicating to the company that it had a period of one month to communicate its written observations pursuant to the provisions of Article 40 of Decree No. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019. 314. ACCOR responded to the sanction report with written observations dated 22 December 2020. 15. The company and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the training session restraint. II. Reasons for decision A. On the European cooperation procedure 16. According to Article 56, paragraph 1, of the Regulation “the supervisory authority of the main establishment or the sole establishment of the controller or of the sub- controller is competent to act as lead supervisory authority in relation to the cross-border processing carried out by this controller or processor, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 60”. 17. In the present case, the Restricted Committee notes, first, that the registered office of the company is located in France since the creation of the company in 1983 and that the company is registered in the register commerce and companies in France from the outset. 18. The Restricted Committee then notes that the first hotels of the ACCOR group were established in France, the company having launched its activity abroad only in a second time. 19. Finally, to date, although the hotels of the ACCOR group are established in 110 countries across worldwide, more than half of the hotels operated under the “AccorHotels” brand in Europe located in France (1,657 hotels out of the 3,051 present in the European Union). 20. All of these elements combine to consider that the main establishment of the company is located in France and that the CNIL is competent to act as the chief supervisory authority leader regarding the cross-border processing carried out by this company, in accordance with Rule 56(1) of the Rules. 21. The Restricted Committee notes that on the date of this draft decision the supervisory authorities of the following countries were involved in this proceeding: Germany, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Spain, Estonia, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and Czech Republic. 4 22. Following an adversarial procedure, a draft decision was adopted by the formation restricted and has been transmitted to the other European supervisory authorities concerned in application of Article 60(3) of the GDPR. 23. On May 28, 2021, the Polish data protection authority raised three objections, in accordance with Article 60(4) of the GDPR. 24. By deliberation no. SAN-2022-001 of January 13, 2022, the Restricted Committee set out its point of view on the objections of the Polish authority and explained the reasons for which it decided not to follow these objections. 25. On 15 June 2022, the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter “EDPS”) adopted decision 01/2022 concerning the dispute relating to the draft decision of the supervisory authority French concerning Accor SA pursuant to Article 65, paragraph 1, point a), of the GDPR. By this decision, the EDPS ruled on the dispute relating to the draft decision which did not concern more than a single objection from the Polish authorities, concerning the amount of the fine set in the draft decision. B. On the breach relating to the obligation to obtain the consent of the person concerned by a direct marketing operation by means of a automated electronic communications system pursuant to article L. 34-5 of the CPCE 1. On the lack of consent of persons to receive messages of commercial prospecting for ACCOR 26. Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE provides: “Direct prospecting by means of a system is prohibited. automated electronic communications within the meaning of 6° of Article L. 32, a fax machine or e-mails using the contact details of a natural person, subscriber or user, who has not previously expressed his consent to receive prospecting direct by this means. For the purposes of this article, consent means any manifestation of free, specific and informed will by which a person accepts that data to personal character concerning it are used for the purpose of direct prospecting. Constitutes direct marketing the sending of any message intended to promote, directly or indirectly, goods, services or the image of a person selling goods or providing services. For the purposes of this article, calls and messages having intended to encourage the user or subscriber to call a premium rate number or to send a surcharged text messages also fall under direct prospecting. However, direct prospecting by e-mail is authorized if the contact details of the recipient were collected from him, in compliance with the provisions of Law No. 78- 17 of January 6, 1978 relating to data processing, files and freedoms, on the occasion of a sale or provision of services, if the direct prospecting concerns products or similar services provided by the same natural or legal person, and if the recipient 5 sees offering, in an express and unambiguous manner, the possibility of opposing, free of charge, apart from those related to the transmission of the refusal, and in a simple way, to the use of its contact information at the time it is collected and each time an email from prospecting is sent to him in case he has not refused such exploitation from the outset. \[…\]”. According to paragraph 6 of the same article, ""The National Commission for Computing and liberties watch, with regard to direct prospecting using the contact details of a subscriber or a natural person, to compliance with the provisions of this article by using the powers recognized by law n° 78-17 of January 6, 1978 mentioned above. At this end, it may in particular receive, by any means, complaints relating to breaches of provisions of this article \[…\]”. 27. It appears from the investigations carried out by the CNIL that, when a person reserves a hotel room directly from the staff of a hotel of one of the hotel brands of the ACCOR group (on site or by telephone) or on the site of one of the hotel brands of the group (Ibis, Novotel, Mercure, Fairmont, Sofitel, Adagio etc.), it was made the recipient e-mails from the company containing the newsletter “All – Accor Live Limitless”, the relevant box consent to receive the newsletter being pre-checked by default. 28. The rapporteur considers that, in these cases, the consent of the recipients emails from the company containing the “All – Accor Live Limitless” newsletter was not validly collected. It notes in particular in this respect that the commercial offers and promotions present in the “All – Accor Live Limitless” newsletter do not bear only on services provided by the company but also relate to the services of “partner” companies – such as, for example, airlines or companies parking lot managers. 29. Under these conditions, the rapporteur considers that the company cannot rely on the exception provided for in Article L. 34-5 paragraph 4 of the CPCE, which provides that an organization may send commercial prospecting messages by e-mail without collecting the prior consent of the persons concerned when the data has been collected with these persons on the occasion of a sale or provision of services and that the commercial prospecting concerns similar products or services provided by the same moral or physical person. 30. The company maintains that it is indeed the company that collects the data from the persons concerned because, on the one hand, it publishes and manages all the reservation sites of all the group brands and, on the other hand, even when used by hotel staff of the group at the request of customers, the tools for booking and joining the program of loyalty are managed by it alone and come to feed its own database. 31. The Restricted Committee takes note that the company is the holder of the reservation sites of all the brands of the group (Ibis, Novotel, etc.). The restricted formation nevertheless falls under that the commercial prospecting messages sent by the company do not carry exclusively on similar products or services provided by this company but that they are 6 likely to contain, for example, promotional offers from partners, such as airlines or car park management companies. 32. Under these conditions, the Restricted Committee considers that the company was required to collect the prior, free, specific and informed consent of persons to receive messages from direct prospecting by e-mail, in accordance with paragraph 1 of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, which did not allow the existence, in this case, of a box relating to the consent to receive the newsletter pre-ticked by default. The Restricted Committee recalls that in its Planet49 judgment of 1 October 2019 (case C-673/19), the Court of Justice of the European Union indicated that a consent collected by means of a pre-ticked box cannot be considered validly given by the user. 33. As part of the procedure, the company justified having taken measures to implement compliance all of its tools for collecting the consent of the persons concerned to receive commercial prospecting messages by e-mail, so that for each of the reservation and membership paths to the program this consent is no longer collected by default. 34. The Restricted Committee therefore considers that the breach of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE is incorporated, but the company has complied by the closing date of instruction. 2. On the lack of consent of the people creating a customer space, at the reception commercial prospecting messages 35. As part of the investigation, the CNIL delegation of control noted that, during the creation of a customer space, the company did not collect the consent of the people for the processing of their personal data for commercial prospecting purposes by emails. Indeed, it has been found that the personal data used by the company for commercial prospecting purposes could be collected from a form for creating a customer area, independently of a reservation, on which there was a ""pre-ticked"" box by default relating to the consent to receive business development. 36. The Restricted Committee considers that the company is required to obtain the consent prior, free, specific and informed of persons creating a customer area on its website, to receive direct prospecting messages by e-mail, in accordance with paragraph 1 of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE. Indeed, insofar as the creation of a space customer can intervene without prior reservation, the exemption from the collection of the consent provided in Article L. 34-5 when similar services are offered cannot be mobilized in this case in point. 737. In response, the company justified having modified its form for creating a customer area, in order to that the consent of the persons concerned to receive prospecting messages is not no longer collected by default. 38. Under these conditions, the Restricted Committee considers that the breach of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE is incorporated, but the company has complied by the closing date of instruction. C. On the breach relating to the obligation to inform the persons in application of Articles 12 and 13 of the GDPR 39. According to paragraph 1 of Article 12 of the GDPR: “The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 as well as to carry out any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 with regard to concerns processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, understandable and easily accessible, in clear and simple terms \[…\]”. 40. Article 13 of the GDPR requires the data controller to provide, at the time when the data are collected, information relating to his identity and contact details, the purposes of the processing and its legal basis, the recipients or the categories of recipients of the data of a personal nature, where applicable the transfers of personal data, the duration of retention of personal data, the rights enjoyed by individuals as well as the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. 41. Firstly, with regard to the accessible nature of the information, the delegation noted during the online check of February 24, 2020 that the forms allowing the creation of a customer account or membership of the ACCOR group loyalty program did not include the information required by article 13 of the GDPR. to take any steps to take cognizance of the information provided to the under Article 13 of the GDPR, for example by accessing via a hypertext link to the the company's ""personal data protection charter"". 42. The Restricted Committee recalls that in order to consider that a data controller satisfies its obligation of transparency, it is necessary in particular that the information provided be “easily accessible” for data subjects within the meaning of Article 12 of the Regulation. 43. It points out, in this regard, that this provision must be interpreted in the light of recital 61 of the Regulation, according to which: “information on the processing of data to personal character relating to the data subject should be provided to him at the time where these data are collected from it”. In this sense, it shares the position of the G29 presented in the guidelines on transparency within the meaning of the Regulation, adopted in their version revised on April 11, 2018 and endorsed on May 25, 2018 by the European Committee for 8 data protection (EDPS) which recalls that “the data subject should not have looking for the information but should be able to access it immediately”. 44. The Restricted Committee considers that in this case the information notices of the persons concerned were not “easily accessible” for the latter, in that, during the creation of an account, access to the “personal data protection charter” of the company was only organized via a hypertext link available at the bottom of the pages of the site internet, which required the user to scroll through the entire page and search information, in breach of Article 12 of the GDPR. 45. As part of the investigation, the company indicated that it had made corrections, in order to deliver information that complies with the requirements of the GDPR. Through an informal check, it has in fact been found that the mentions of information relating to the processing of personal data personal information had been completed on the account creation and membership forms loyalty program and that the “customer personal data protection charter” was now directly accessible from a link inserted on these forms. 46. Secondly, the delegation of control noted that the “data protection charter personal information of customers"" of the company specifies that the legal basis for the processing of personal data personal in connection with the sending of commercial prospecting is the ""legitimate interest"" or “performance of a contract”. 47. However, the rapporteur maintains that, in the cases mentioned above, for the sending prospecting messages relating to the products or services of third parties, the company cannot dispense with obtaining the consent of the persons concerned to receive messages from business development. 48. In response, the company indicates that, even if the consent of the persons concerned must be collected under the provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, the processing carried out for the purposes of commercial prospecting have legitimate interest as their legal basis. 49. As previously explained, the Restricted Committee considers that in certain hypotheses the company is required to obtain the prior, free, specific and informed of the persons concerned to receive direct prospecting messages by mail electronically, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE. 50. The Restricted Committee considers that when obtaining the consent of the data subject is required for the processing of his personal data for a specific purpose (and not only for a given operation), the legal basis of the processing thus implemented is consent. 51. Consequently, the Restricted Committee notes that by not mentioning the consent as a legal basis for processing, for prospecting to promote the products or third-party services, the company has breached its obligation under Article 13 of the GDPR. 952. The Restricted Committee therefore considers that all of these facts constitute breaches of Articles 12 and 13 of the GDPR. D. On the breach relating to the obligation to respect the right of access of individuals pursuant to Article 15 of the GDPR 53. Article 15.1 of the GDPR provides the data subject with a right of access to his or her data personal character terms: “The data subject has the right to obtain responsible of processing the confirmation that personal data concerning him are or are not are not processed and, when they are, access to said personal data (…)”. 54. Article 12.3 of the GDPR further specifies that “the controller shall provide the data subject information on the measures taken following a request made pursuant to Articles 15 to 22, as soon as possible and in any event within a one month from receipt of the request. 55. During the investigation of complaint no. \[…\] received by the CNIL, it appeared that the company failed in its obligation to provide the complainant, within the time limit set by the GDPR, with a copy of its personal data that it held in its database. 56. The rapporteur notes that the author of the complaint made a request for a right of access on August 1, 2019, the date on which his client account had been suspended following fraudulent connection detection. However, while the complainant had justified his identity on January 10, 2020, thus allowing the reopening of his customer account by the company, no response had yet been provided to its request for right of access on the date of control by the CNIL delegation, on February 11, 2020. The company granted the request for the complainant on February 24, 2020. 57. The Restricted Committee considers that, in the event that a client's account has been subject to detection of a fraudulent connection, the company may certainly have a reasonable doubt about the identity of the applicant wishing to exercise his right of access, justifying that an identity document be requested from the person concerned. 58. The Restricted Committee considers, however, that once the doubt is removed as to the identity of the person, the right of access request must be honored by the controller. 59. Under these conditions, the Restricted Committee considers that the breach of Article 15 of the GDPR is made with regard to complaint no. \[…\], although it does not appear from the file that any beyond this one-off complaint, the failure had a structural character. 10 E. On the breach relating to the obligation to respect the right of opposition of persons pursuant to Article 21 of the GDPR 60. According to Article 21.2 of the GDPR: “when the personal data are processed for prospecting purposes, the data subject has the right to object at any time the processing of personal data concerning him for such prospecting purposes, including profiling insofar as it is linked to such prospecting”. 61. Firstly, the rapporteur noted that the author of complaint no. \[…\] opposed the receipt of prospecting messages from the company on its two mailing addresses email, December 11, 2018. 62. The rapporteur considered that the company had not responded satisfactorily to the complainant's opposition request, since his opposition request has not been taken into account only on January 11, 2020 and for only one of the two email addresses concerned. 63. In response, the company indicated that it had found no trace of this opposition request in its systems. It also indicates that it has not found in its database either the first e-mail address referred to by the complainant in his request and specifies, with regard to the second email address, that it is the author of the complaint himself who has unsubscribed newsletters on January 11, 2020. 64. The Restricted Committee considers that, with regard to this first complaint, the elements of the debate do not lead to the conclusion of a breach committed by the company. 65. Secondly, the investigation of complaints no. \[…\] received by the CNIL revealed the existence of malfunctions of the unsubscribe link at the bottom of prospecting emails addressed by the company, resulting from two types of technical problems affecting one or another step in the unsubscribe process. 66. First, between November 11, 2018 and January 21, 2019, malfunctions were intervened in the transmission of information relating to unsubscriptions between the tool to manage the sending of newsletters and the customer repository, which records the information whether or not a customer subscribes to newsletters. Thus, during this period, the tool management of newsletters was not informed by the customer repository of the creations or updates day of contacts and unsubscriptions to associated newsletters made every Sunday between midnight and 8 p.m. From then until January 21, 2019, the author of complaint no. to receive commercial prospecting messages from the company, despite its request of unsubscription formulated on Sunday, November 18, 2018 in the afternoon. 67. Next, another anomaly, also affecting the synchronization of unsubscriptions between the customer repository and the tool that manages the sending of newsletters, was identified by the company on February 8, 2019. This anomaly explains why the author of complaint no. \[…\] continued to 11 receive the ACCOR company newsletter between January 2, 2019 and February 8, 2019, despite the deletion of its data from the customer repository as of January 1, 2019. 68. The Restricted Committee considers that these two anomalies, which recurred during several weeks, are likely to have prevented a significant number of people from effectively oppose the receipt of prospecting messages. She notes in this regard that it appears from the documents in the file that in 2019, \[…\] million people received at an address email validates at least one of the ACCOR group newsletters. 69. In response, the company indicates that it has taken measures to improve the management of requests exercise of rights and to prevent anomalies in the consideration of requests of opposition. 70. The Restricted Committee takes note of the compliance measures adopted by the company, but considers that the company has in the past disregarded its obligations under the provisions of article 21.2 of the GDPR, since the aforementioned anomalies have failed to take into account account within a reasonable time of requests to object to receiving messages from commercial prospecting on the part of the persons concerned. F. On the breach of the obligation to ensure the security of data at personal character pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR 71. Rule 32 of the Rules provides: “1. Taking into account the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks, including the degree of likelihood and severity varies, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the responsible for processing and the processor implement the technical measures and appropriate organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including including, among others, as needed: a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data; b) means to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience constants of processing systems and services; c) the means to restore the availability of personal data and access to these within appropriate timeframes in the event of a physical or technical incident; d) a procedure to regularly test, analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of the measures technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing \[…\]”. 72. Firstly, the rapporteur notes that, during the on-site inspection of 11 February 2020, the delegation noted that the use of a password consisting of eight characters containing only two character types (seven capital letters and one special character) allowed access the management tool for sending communications to customers. 1273. The rapporteur considers that, taking into account in particular the volume of personal data processed by the “Adobe Campaign” tool, the requirements put in place by the company in terms of strength of the passwords are insufficient and do not ensure the security of the personal data. 74. In response, the company argues that, given the existence of an additional measure security – taking into account that access to the “Adobe Campaign” software is only possible from a terminal connected to the ACCOR network – a single level of complexity (lower case or number) was missing for the password noted by the delegation to meet the recommendations of the CNIL. The company also justifies having reinforced the rules of complexity of the password access to the “Adobe Campaign” software, which must now include a minimum of nine characters and four levels of complexity. 75. The Restricted Committee considers that the length and complexity of a password remain basic criteria to assess its strength. She notes in this regard that the need for a strong password is also highlighted by the National Security Agency information systems. 76. By way of clarification, the Restricted Committee recalls that to ensure a level of security sufficient and meet the strength requirements of passwords, when an authentication is based solely on an identifier and a password, the CNIL recommends, in its deliberation n° 2017-012 of January 19, 2017, that the password contains at least twelve characters - containing at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number and one special character - or else has at least eight characters - containing three of these four character categories - if accompanied by an additional measure such as, for example, example, the delay in accessing the account after several failures (temporary suspension of access, the duration of which increases as attempts are made), the establishment of a mechanism to protect against automated and intensive submissions of attempts (like a “captcha”) and/or blocking of the account after several authentication attempts unsuccessful. 77. In the present case, the Restricted Committee considers that, with regard to the rules governing their composition, the robustness of the passwords accepted by the company for access to the software ""Adobe Campaign"" was too weak, leading to a risk of data compromise at personal character it contains. 78. The Restricted Committee notes, however, that the company justifies having increased the level of complexity of passwords for connecting to the “Adobe Campaign” software. 79. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the breach relating to the obligation to ensure the security of personal data is constituted, but that the company has compliance on this point before the close of the investigation. 1380. Secondly, the rapporteur indicated that when a client's account is suspended in reason of a suspicion of fraudulent connection, the customer service invites the person concerned to send a copy of his identity document as an email attachment. 81. The rapporteur notes that the conditions under which the copy of the identity document of customers whose account has been suspended is transmitted, do not allow to protect themselves against its interception by a third party. 82. The Restricted Committee considers that the practice consisting in the transmission of data not encrypted by e-mail generates a significant risk for the confidentiality of the transmitted data. 83. In this regard, the Restricted Committee recalls that, in its guide on “data security personal information"", the CNIL recommends as an elementary security precaution the encryption data before being recorded on a physical medium or transmitted by email. It also recommends ensuring the confidentiality of the password. decryption pass by transmitting it through another channel. 84. In view of all of these elements, the Restricted Committee considers that the aforementioned facts constitute a breach of Article 32 of the GDPR. III. On corrective measures and their publicity 85. Under the terms of III of article 20 of the amended law of 6 January 1978: “When the data controller or its processor fails to comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or from this law, the Chairman of the National Commission for Computing and Liberties may also, if necessary after it have sent the warning provided for in I of this article or, where applicable, in addition of a formal notice provided for in II, seize the restricted formation of the committee with a view to pronouncement, after contradictory procedure, of one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of turnover annual total for the previous financial year, whichever is greater. In the assumptions mentioned in 5 and 6 of article 83 of regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover respectively. The Restricted Committee takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83”. 86. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that “Each supervisory authority shall ensure that fines administrative measures imposed under this article for violations of this regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and 14 deterrents”, before specifying the elements to be taken into account to decide whether there is instead of imposing an administrative fine and to decide on the amount of this fine. 87. In defence, the company argues that a penalty is not necessary given all of the of the measures it has taken to remedy the shortcomings noted and considers, in all case, that the amount of the administrative fine proposed by the rapporteur is disproportionate in view, in particular, of the low seriousness of the breaches, of the measures taken to remedy this, to its cooperation with the services of the CNIL and to its financial situation, significantly degraded due to the current health crisis. The company also supports that the publicity of the sanction decision of the restricted training would have for it manifestly disproportionate consequences. 88. As regards the nature and seriousness of the breach, the Restricted Committee first notes the number of breaches alleged against the company: carrying out prospecting campaigns massive by e-mail without consent of the persons, absence of information easily accessible and complete on the processing carried out, difficulties encountered in the context of the exercise of their rights by complainants and data security deficiencies. She stresses that these shortcomings relate to several fundamental principles of the legislation applicable to the protection of personal data and that they constitute a substantial interference with the rights of data subjects. 89. The Restricted Committee then noted the particularly large number of people concerned by these shortcomings, since in 2019, \[…\] million people received on a valid email address at least one of the ACCOR group newsletters. 90. The Restricted Committee holds, finally, that these breaches had direct consequences for the persons concerned, as evidenced in particular by the fact that the CNIL was seized eleven complaints relating in particular to the right to object to receiving messages from business development. 91. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that an administrative fine should be imposed with regard to the established breaches. 92. With regard to the amount of the fine for breaches of the GDPR, the training Restricted recalls that paragraph 3 of Rule 83 of the Rules provides that in the event of multiple violations, as is the case here, the total amount of the fine cannot exceed the amount set for the most serious breach. Insofar as it is alleged that the company a breach of sections 12.1, 12.3, 13, 15.1, 21.2 and 32 of the Regulations, the amount maximum fine that can be withheld is 20 million euros or 4% of the turnover worldwide annual revenue, whichever is higher. 93. The Restricted Committee notes that the company's turnover amounted to \[…\] euros in 2021. 15 94. With regard to the amount of the fine relating to the breach of Article L.34-5 of the CPCE, the restricted training is called only with regard to breaches of the provisions finding their origin in texts other than the GDPR, as is the case with article L.34-5 of the CPCE which transposes the “ePrivacy” directive into domestic law, Article 20, paragraph III, of the law ""Informatique et Libertés"" gives it jurisdiction to pronounce various sanctions, in particular an administrative fine, the maximum amount of which may be equivalent to 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover for the previous financial year achieved by the head of treatment. In addition, the determination of the amount of this fine is also assessed on the basis of with regard to the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR. 95. To assess the proportionality of the fine, the Restricted Committee took into account that the company has complied with all of the shortcomings identified and with what some of them, in connection with the exercise of the rights of individuals, did not have a structural character. It further notes that the company cooperated fully with the CNIL. 96. The restricted committee also takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine pronounced, of the financial situation of the company. In this regard, the company reports a decrease of its turnover in 2020 and 2021 compared to 2019. Indeed, the turnover of the company amounted to \[…\] in 2019, \[…\] in 2020 and \[…\] in 2021. 97. Finally, the Restricted Committee takes note of EDPS Decision No. 01/2022 concerning the dispute relating to the draft decision of the French supervisory authority concerning Accor SA in application of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR. In particular, she notes that the EDPS instructed the CNIL to re-examine the elements on which it relied to calculate the amount of the fine, in order to ensure that the fine meets the deterrent effect test provided for in Article 83(1) of the GDPR. 98. Therefore, in view of the economic context caused by the Covid-19 health crisis, its consequences on the financial situation of the company and the relevant criteria of Article 83, paragraph 2 of the GDPR mentioned above, the Restricted Committee considers that the pronouncement an administrative fine of 600,000 euros appears justified. 99. Finally, the Restricted Committee considers that the publication of its sanction decision for a duration of two years is justified in view of the plurality of breaches noted, their seriousness and the number of people involved. 100. The Restricted Committee specifies that the administrative fine of 600,000 euros against ACCOR is liable for up to 100,000 euros for the breach of the provisions of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE and up to 500,000 euros for breaches by the company the provisions of Articles 12.1, 12.3, 13, 15.1, 21.2 and 32 of the Regulations. 16 FOR THESE REASONS The CNIL Restricted Committee, after having deliberated, decides to:  pronounce against ACCOR SA an administrative fine of one amount of €600,000 for all of the shortcomings observed, which breaks down as follows: o 100,000 (one hundred thousand) euros for the breach by the company of Article L. 34- 5 of the Post and Electronic Communications Code; o 500,000 (five hundred thousand) euros for breaches by the company of the Articles 12.1, 12.3, 13, 15.1, 21.2 and 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016.  make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from of its publication. President Alexander LINDEN This decision may be subject to appeal before the Council of State in a two months from its notification. 17"

The GIE INFOGREFFE having had the floor last; The Restricted Committee adopted the following decision: I. Facts and procedure 1. Infogreffe (hereinafter ""the body"" or ""the group""), whose registered office is located at 5, avenue de Paris in Vincennes (94300), is an economic interest group (GIE) of court registries of commerce of France which publishes since 1986 the service of diffusion of the legal and official information on the companies through several channels, in particular the Web site ""infogreffe.fr"" since 1996. 2. The ""infogreffe.fr"" website allows you to consult legal information on companies and to order documents certified by the registries of the commercial courts. Users wishing to view or order a paid act on the website must have an account and are designated by Infogreffe as ""members"". It is also possible for users to take out an annual subscription, in particular allowing ""subscribers"" to access certain services in the business consultation section. When creating an account, member or subscriber, the user must fill in the following mandatory fields: surname, first name, postal and electronic addresses, landline or mobile phone and choice of a secret question and its answer. The bank details of subscribers (IBAN and BIC) are also processed by Infogreffe. 3. For the year 2019, the organization achieved a turnover of \[…\] euros, for a net result of \[…\] euros. In 2020, it achieved a turnover of \[…\] euros, for a net result of \[…\] euros. 4. On December 12, 2020, the National Commission for Computing and Liberties (hereinafter ""the CNIL"" or ""the Commission"") received a complaint against the organization, a person stating that the ""infogreffe.fr"" website stores user passwords in plain text and that they were able to obtain their password over the phone simply by giving their name to the helpdesk contact telephone. 5. In application of decision n° 2021-032C of January 6, 2021 of the President of the CNIL, a control mission was carried out in order to verify the conformity of any processing accessible from the ""infogreffe.fr"" domain, or relating to personal data collected from the latter, to the provisions of law n ° 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter ""the law of January 6 1978 amended"" or the ""Data Protection Act"") and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (hereinafter the ""Regulation"" or the ""GDPR""). 6. Thus, an online check was carried out on March 4, 2021 on the ""infogreffe.fr"" site implemented by the group. The report n° 2021-032/1 drawn up at the end of the inspection was notified to the organization by registered mail, received on March 10, 2021. 7. The CNIL delegation has in particular endeavored to check the procedure for transmitting user passwords when creating an account or in the event of forgetting or losing the password. 8. By letters dated March 19, May 25 and June 24, 2021, the organization transmitted to the CNIL the elements requested by the report n° 2021-032/1 and responded to its requests for additional information sent by email on May 17 and June 18, 2021. The organization confirms in particular that it determines the purposes and methods of implementing the processing of personal data on the ""infogreffe.fr"" site. It also specifies the retention periods for the data it collects and the measures taken to ensure their security. Infogreffe also told the delegation that during the year 2020, the site was consulted by more than 24 million people worldwide and that, of the 3.7 million people with an account, more of 8,000 European accounts were not French. 9. In accordance with Article 56 of the GDPR, the CNIL has informed all the European supervisory authorities of its competence to act as lead supervisory authority concerning the cross-border processing implemented by Infogreffe, resulting from that the sole establishment of the grouping is in France. After discussion between the CNIL and the European data protection authorities within the framework of the one-stop-shop mechanism, these are all concerned by the processing since user accounts have been created by residents of all the Member States of the Union. European. 10. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission, on October 21, 2021, appointed Mr François PELLEGRINI as rapporteur on the basis of Article 22 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended, and in informed the organization by letter dated October 26, 2021. 11. On December 2, 2021, the rapporteur asked the organization to provide its last three balance sheets, which the organization did by letter dated December 15, 2021. 12. At the end of his investigation, the rapporteur, on February 16, 2022, had the organization notified of a report detailing the breaches of the GDPR that he considered constituted in this case, accompanied by a notice to attend the meeting. of the restricted training of April 21, 2022. The letter notifying the report indicated to the organization that it had a period of one month to communicate its written observations in response, in accordance with article 40 of decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 amended. 13. This report proposed to the restricted formation of the Commission to impose an administrative fine with regard to the breaches of Articles 5, paragraph 1, e) and 32 of the GDPR. He also proposed that this decision be made public, but that it would no longer be possible to identify the organization by name after the expiry of a period of two years from its publication. 14. On February 22, 2022, the organization requested an extension of the one-month deadline to produce observations in response to the sanction report. On February 25, 2022, the Chairman of the Restricted Committee granted this request and postponed the Restricted Committee meeting. 15. On April 15, 2022, the body produced its observations in response to the sanction report and requested that the restricted committee session be held in camera. This request was rejected by the president of the restricted committee, the organization being notified by letter dated April 21, 2022. 16. The organization and the rapporteur presented oral observations during the session of the Restricted Committee. II. Reasons for decision 17. Pursuant to Article 60(3) of the GDPR, the draft decision adopted by the Restricted Committee was sent to all European data protection authorities on July 19, 2022. 18. As of August 16, 2022, no supervisory authority had raised any relevant and reasoned objection to this draft decision, so that, pursuant to Article 60(6) of the GDPR, the latter are deemed to have approved it. A. On the breach of the obligation to retain the data for a period proportionate to the purpose of the processing pursuant to Article 5, paragraph 1, e) of the GDPR 19. According to Article 5, paragraph 1, e) of the GDPR, personal data must be kept in a form allowing the identification of the data subjects for a period not exceeding that necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. 20. As part of the check, the delegation noted that the ""Confidentiality Charter"" of the ""infogreffe.fr"" website provides that the personal data of members and subscribers are kept for 36 months from the last order of service and/or documents. 21. However, the organization provided the CNIL delegation with a spreadsheet file from which it appears that as of May 1, 2021, it retained the personal data of 946,023 members and 17,558 subscribers, including the last order, the last formality or even the last invoice for subscribers dates back more than 36 months, without the organization being able to justify recent contact with said members or subscribers. 22. The rapporteur notes that no procedure for the automatic deletion of personal data has been put in place by the organization and that the data were kept for excessive periods of time in relation to their purpose and the own policy set by the 'organization. 23. In defence, the organization admits that personal data have been kept for longer than the duration indicated in its Charter but contests the fact that the duration indicated in this Charter is taken as the only reference whereas with regard to other purposes, such as those relating to recovery operations, it would be justified for certain data to be kept for a period of more than 36 months. With regard to the anonymization of personal data, the organization admits that 25% of accounts were kept for more than 36 months after the last order, formality or invoice, without being anonymized. He also admits the delay in automating anonymization but disputes the fact that there was no anonymization of accounts. 24. Firstly, the Restricted Committee notes that the purpose relating to collection operations, cited by the organization, and the related retention period could a priori only concern the data of subscribers and not of members, the latter paying immediately in exchange for receipt of a deed. In addition, the Restricted Committee notes that, for this purpose as for accounting and tax purposes, the organization had not identified these purposes and the corresponding durations in its Confidentiality Charter on the date of the inspection. In any case, the Restricted Committee notes that while the retention of certain data for these purposes may appear justified, it requires that various actions be carried out. Thus, the Restricted Committee recalls that once the purpose of the processing has been achieved, the retention of certain data for compliance with legal obligations or for pre-litigation or litigation purposes is possible, but the data must then be placed in intermediate archiving, to a duration not exceeding that necessary for the purposes for which they are kept, in accordance with the provisions in force. Only the relevant data must be placed in intermediate archiving, either in a dedicated archive database, or by performing a logical separation within the active database, allowing only authorized persons to access it. The Restricted Committee notes that on the day of the inspection, none of these actions had been implemented by the organisation. 25. Secondly, the Restricted Committee notes that the manual anonymization implemented by the organization at the request of users only concerned a very small number of accounts since on the day of the online check, 25% of accounts n were not anonymized when they should have been. The Restricted Committee notes that no automatic anonymization procedure was implemented on the day of the online check, the organization thus retaining identifying data without time limit in the absence of an anonymization request from the users. 26. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the aforementioned facts constitute a structural breach of Article 5, paragraph 1, e) of the GDPR. 27. The Restricted Committee notes that the organization indicated, during the procedure, that a purge of accounts inactive for more than 36 months had been implemented since the audit, but retains that the breach remains characterized for the past. B. On breaches of the obligation to ensure the security of personal data (Article 32 GDPR). 28. Article 32 of the GDPR provides that ""1. Taking into account the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks, including the degree of probability and seriousness varies, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, including between others, as needed: a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data; b) the means to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; c) the means to restore the availability of personal data and access to them within an appropriate period of time in the event of a physical or technical incident; d) a procedure for regularly testing, analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing. "" 29. The rapporteur notes, firstly, that the delegation found that the passwords for connecting users to their accounts, accessible from the organization's website, are insufficiently robust in that they are limited to eight characters, without any complexity criteria, and are not associated with any additional security measures. In addition, the rapporteur notes that on the day of the findings, it was impossible for all users or subscribers of the ""infogreffe.fr"" website, i.e. for more than 3.7 million accounts, to enter a password secure password due to the limitation of their size to 8 characters maximum. 30. The rapporteur notes, secondly, that the organization sends non-temporary passwords in plain text by email allowing access to the accounts. 31. The rapporteur points out, thirdly, that the organization also keeps in plain text in its database the passwords as well as the secret questions and answers used during the password reset procedure by users. 32. Finally, the rapporteur notes that the organization does not confirm to the user the modification of his password either. The rapporteur considers that the user who is not alerted in the event of an unauthorized modification is therefore not protected against attempts to usurp his account. 33. In view of these elements, the rapporteur considers that the various security measures put in place by the organization are insufficient with regard to Article 32 of the GDPR. 34. In defence, the organization argues that the security obligation is an obligation of means which must be assessed in concreto and that its non-performance must be established by a finding of the ineffectiveness of the measures implemented, having led to unauthorized access, which is not the case here. He stresses that the recommendation relating to passwords mentioned by the rapporteur constitutes flexible law, that it is not a question of mandatory rules, applicable in abstracto, independently of any context and non-compliance with which would, in itself, even, such as to justify an administrative sanction. In addition, the organization specifies that the impact analysis relating to data protection revealed a low risk for personal data in the event of unauthorized access since for member accounts, representing the majority of accounts, bank details are not recorded, unlike subscriber accounts and an unauthorized third party will not be able to take any action other than the purchase of documents and the sending of formalities in place of the account holder. Finally, the organization emphasizes that the information accessible by logging into a user's account is essentially personal data present in the K or KBIS extracts and the other acts that can be ordered, except for the accounts created by non-professionals whose identification and location data are not public. 35. First of all, the Restricted Committee recalls that, pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR, to ensure the protection of personal data, it is the responsibility of the data controller to take ""appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk"". The Restricted Committee considers that the use of a short or simple password without imposing specific categories of characters and without additional security measures, can lead to attacks by unauthorized third parties, such as ""brute force"" attacks "" or "" by dictionary "", which consist in successively and systematically testing many passwords and thus lead to a compromise of the associated accounts and the personal data they contain. It notes, in this respect, that the need for a strong password is recommended both by the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) and by the Commission in its deliberation No. 2017-012 of 19 January 2017. In this case, the Restricted Committee notes that the passwords in question are limited to eight characters without any complexity criterion, and are not associated with any additional security measure. The Restricted Committee considers that the risk run by the persons concerned is real: a third party having had access to the password could not only access all the personal data present in the account of the person concerned, but also consult the history of its orders, download its invoices and/or change the password of the account and the contact information without the knowledge of the user. 36. In addition, the Restricted Committee considers that the procedures for the transmission and storage of passwords implemented by the organization are not appropriate with regard to the risk that the capture of their identifier and password would pose to the person concerned. their password by a third party. Indeed, the transmission, in plain text, of a password which is neither temporary nor for single use and whose renewal is not imposed, makes it easily and immediately usable by a third party who would have improper access. to the message that contains it. The Restricted Committee recalls that a simple handling error can lead to the disclosure of personal data to unauthorized recipients and thus infringe the right to privacy of individuals. Finally, the Restricted Committee considers that the user who is not alerted in the event of an unauthorized modification is therefore not protected against attempts to usurp his account. 37. Therefore, taking into account these risks for the protection of personal data and the privacy of individuals leads the Restricted Committee to consider that the measures deployed to guarantee data security in this case are insufficient. 38. Next, the Restricted Committee specifies that if deliberation no. 2017-012 of January 19, 2017, the CNIL guide relating to the security of personal data and the ANSSI technical note relating to the passwords cited in the rapporteur's writings are certainly not imperative, they nevertheless set out the basic safety precautions corresponding to the state of the art. Therefore, the Restricted Committee recalls that it retains a breach of the obligations arising from Article 32 of the GDPR and not the non-compliance with the recommendations, which moreover constitute relevant insight for assessing the risks and the state of the art in personal data security. 39. In addition to these recommendations, the Restricted Committee stresses that it has, on several occasions, adopted financial penalties where the characterization of a breach of Article 32 of the GDPR is the result of insufficient measures to guarantee the security of the data processed. , and not just the result of the existence of a personal data breach. Deliberations No. SAN-2019-006 of June 13, 2019 and No. SAN-2019-007 of July 18, 2019 relate in particular to the insufficient robustness of passwords as well as their transmission to the organization's customers by email, in plain text. , after creating the account. 40. Under these conditions, in view of the risks incurred by individuals, mentioned above, as well as the volume and nature of the personal data which may be contained in more than 3.7 million accounts (banking data subscriber accounts, surname, first name, postal and electronic address, landline or mobile telephone numbers, secret question and its answer for all the accounts), the Restricted Committee considers that the organization has breached its obligations under of Article 32 of the GDPR. 41. The Restricted Committee notes that in the context of this procedure the organization has taken certain measures to ensure the security of the data processed. Nevertheless, it considers that, since the implementation of its password policy in 2002 and until June 2021, the security measures put in place by the organization did not allow it to ensure a level of sufficient security of the personal data processed and that, therefore, a breach of the obligations of Article 32 of the Regulation has been constituted. III. On corrective measures and their publicity 42. Under the terms of III of article 20 of the amended law of 6 January 1978: ""When the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or from this law, the President of the National Commission for Computing and Liberties may also , if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, if necessary in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, seize the restricted formation of the commission with a view to the pronouncement, after adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of of a company, 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher In the cases mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased, respectively, to 20 thousand lion euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted formation takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83. "" 43. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that “Each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this Article for breaches of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive”, before specifying the elements to be taken into account to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide on the amount of this fine. 44. Firstly, on the principle of imposing a fine, the organization insists in defense on the contractual liability of its subcontractor with regard to the instructions that had been given to it concerning the security and anonymization of the data to be personal nature, on the prioritization of other legal and regulatory projects in relation to its compliance with the GDPR, on its significant cooperation with the CNIL and the significant efforts made since the start of the control. 45. The Restricted Committee recalls that it must take into account, for the pronouncement of an administrative fine, the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the violation, the number of persons affected, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by the persons concerned, whether the breach was negligent, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and the categories of personal data affected by the breach. 46. The Restricted Committee firstly considers that although the organization gave specific instructions on anonymization and security to its subcontractor, it appears that it did not follow the execution of these instructions. and has not exercised satisfactory and regular control over the technical and organizational measures implemented by its subcontractor to ensure compliance with the GDPR and, in particular, to ensure the anonymization and security of the personal data processed. 47. The Restricted Committee also considers that it is necessary to take into account the nature of the actor concerned, bringing together the clerks of the commercial courts, who are public and ministerial officers responsible for the performance of public service missions. As such, the Restricted Committee considers that the organization should therefore have shown particular rigor in respecting all of its legal and regulatory obligations. However, it results from the debates that the organization has postponed the implementation of projects relating to the anonymization and security of personal data in order to respond, without increasing its available resources, to other obligations of compliance that were not related to data protection. 48. The Restricted Committee then notes that the alleged breaches are breaches of key principles of the GDPR which were not introduced by this text but pre-existed in the ""Informatique et Libertés"" law. The Restricted Committee also stresses that these shortcomings cannot be regarded as an isolated incident. With regard to the breach relating to the retention period, the Restricted Committee recalls that the organization had itself set a retention period for personal data which it did not respect and that this breach concerns more than one million user, member and subscriber accounts. With regard to the breach relating to data security, the Restricted Committee considers that the extreme weakness of the password complexity rules, as well as the security measures for the communication, storage and renewal of passwords, in force since 2002, made all the accounts vulnerable. 49. Finally, the Restricted Committee notes that the compliance measures put in place following the notification of the sanction report do not exonerate the organization from its liability for the breaches observed. 50. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that an administrative fine should be imposed with regard to the breaches of Articles 5, paragraph 1, e) and 32 of the GDPR. 51. Secondly, with regard to the amount of the fine, the organization insists in defense on the isolated nature of the complaint at the origin of the control and the absence of financial gain derived from the breaches. 52. The Restricted Committee recalls that administrative fines must be both dissuasive and proportionate. It considers that the origin of the control, which took place following a single complaint, cannot minimize the seriousness of the shortcomings which, moreover, turned out to be structural. In this case, the Restricted Committee finds, with regard to the breach relating to the retention period of personal data, that the organization has shown gross negligence relating to a fundamental principle of the GDPR and that this breach concerns more 25% of accounts. With regard to the breach relating to security, the Restricted Committee notes that given the accumulation of security flaws, the facts observed are particularly serious, especially since they have reported all the accounts vulnerable. The Restricted Committee then recalls that the organization has postponed its compliance with the GDPR in favor of other legal and regulatory priorities. Finally, the restricted training takes into account the activity of the organization and its financial situation. It also records the efforts made by the organization to comply throughout this procedure. 53. In view of these elements, the Restricted Committee considers that the imposition of an administrative fine of two hundred and fifty thousand euros appears justified. 54. Finally, with regard to the publicity of the sanction, the organization maintains that such a measure would be disproportionate in view of the harm it would cause. 55. The Restricted Committee considers that the publicity of the sanction is justified in view of the seriousness of the breaches noted, the nature of the actor concerned who, given its size and activity, has the human, financial and techniques to enable it to ensure a satisfactory level of protection of personal data and the strong reputation enjoyed by the website in terms of commercial data. FOR THESE REASONS The CNIL Restricted Committee, after having deliberated, decides to: • impose an administrative fine on GIE INFOGREFFE in the amount of 250,000 (two hundred and fifty thousand) euros for breaches of Articles 5, paragraph 1, e) and 32 of the GDPR; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the organization by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. President Alexander LINDEN This decision may be appealed to the Council of State within two months of its notification."

Facts and procedure 1. DISCORD INC (hereinafter ""the Company""), headquartered at 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107 (UNITED STATES), was established in 2015. As of January 2021, it had approximately 300 employees. 2. For the years 2019 and 2020, the company had revenues of approximately $\[...\] and approximately $\[...\] respectively. 3. DISCORD is a voice over IP (technology that allows users to chat via their microphone and/or webcam over the Internet) and instant messaging software, allowing users to create servers, as well as text, voice and video rooms. DISCORD is thus a platform for people with similar interests to share and communicate. The software is available on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android and can also be accessed directly through a web browser, from the URL ""https://discord.com"", or via an application. Popular among the gaming community for providing a way to communicate with each other and develop a community outside of the games themselves, DISCORD has become a comprehensive social network with a wide range of ways to interact. The application became very popular during the Covid-19 pandemic containment, especially with a young audience. 4. The software is free to use as a whole, but DISCORD offers the possibility of subscribing to improve one's profile, add features on servers, have more throughput for file exchange, etc. 5. In January 2021, approximately \[...\] DISCORD user accounts were registered worldwide, including over \[...\] in France. 6. The company does not have an establishment in the European Union but has appointed a representative, in accordance with Article 27 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (hereinafter ""GDPR""), namely the Irish company VERASAFE. 7. Pursuant to Decision No. 2020-272C of the President of the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (hereinafter the ""Commission"" or the ""CNIL"") of 14 August 2020, the CNIL carried out an online control mission on the ""discord.com"" website and on the DISCORD mobile application on 17 November 2020. 8. On 29 December 2020, an off-site inspection mission to the company was also carried out by sending a questionnaire to the company. 9. On 5 and 12 February 2021, the company sent elements of its response to the CNIL. By e-mail dated 8 March 2021, the CNIL delegation requested additional information from the company's counsel, which was sent by the company's counsel on 23 and 24 March 2021. 10. For the purposes of investigating these elements, the Commission's Chairperson appointed Ms Valérie PEUGEOT as rapporteur on 24 December 2021, on the basis of Article 39 of Decree no. 2019-536 of 29 May 2019. 11. On 25 February 2022, the rapporteur sent the company a report detailing the breaches of the GDPR that she considered to have occurred in this case. The report proposed that the Commission's restricted formation impose an administrative fine in respect of the breaches of Articles 5(1)(e), 12, 13, 21(1), 25(2), 32 and 35 of the GDPR. It also proposed that the decision to impose a fine should be made public, but that it should no longer be possible to identify the company by name after a period of two years from its publication. 12. On 15 April 2022, the company submitted its observations in response to the penalty report. 13. The rapporteur replied to the company's observations on 12 May 2022. 14. On 12 July 2022, the company submitted new observations in response to the rapporteur's observations. 15. By letter dated 10 August 2022, the rapporteur informed the company's counsel that the investigation was closed, pursuant to Article 40, III, of amended Decree no. 2019-536 of 29 May 2019. 16. By letter dated 11 August 2022, the company was informed that the case was included on the agenda of the restricted formation of 15 September 2022. 17. The company and the rapporteur presented oral observations at the meeting of the restricted formation. II. Reasons for the decision A. On the processing operations at issue and the applicability of the GDPR 18. Article 3(2)(a) of the GDPR provides that ""This Regulation shall apply to the processing of personal data relating to data subjects who are within the Union by a controller or processor who is not established in the Union, where the processing activities relate to: (a) the supply of goods or services to those data subjects within the Union, whether or not payment is required from those data subjects \[...\]"". 19. DISCORD INC. processes personal data of users (hereinafter ""the processing operations at issue"") when they create a DISCORD account and for the provision of the functionalities enabled by the software. 20. The restricted panel notes, without this being contested by the company in the context of the present procedure, that DISCORD INC. processes personal data of users located in France. According to the information provided by the company during the inspection procedure, DISCORD had more than \[...\] users in France in January 2021. Furthermore, it emerges from the report of the online observations of 17 November 2020 that, both on a computer from the URL ""discord.com"" and on the DISCORD application on a mobile phone, all the pages are accessible in French, with the exception of the privacy policy, which was available in English only at the time of the online observations, but which is now accessible in French. Furthermore, the various processes implemented by DISCORD INC. through its website and its application are directly linked to the services it offers. This includes, for example, processing in connection with the creation of an account, the provision of the DISCORD messaging platform and social network or purchases made. Finally, the privacy policy of DISCORD INC. refers to the RGPD and the company VERASAFE located in Ireland has been appointed as representative under Article 27 of the RGPD. 21. 21. Consequently, the restricted panel notes that the processing operations at issue concern an offer of services intended for persons residing in the European Union and deduces that these processing operations are subject to the GDPR pursuant to Article 3(2)(a) of this Regulation. B. On the competence of the CNIL 22. Article 55(1) of the GDPR provides that ""each supervisory authority shall be competent to carry out the tasks and exercise the powers vested in it pursuant to this Regulation in the territory of its Member State"". 23. Article 56(1) of the GDPR provides that ""without prejudice to Article 55, the supervisory authority of the principal or sole establishment of the controller or processor shall be competent to act as lead supervisory authority with regard to the cross-border processing carried out by that controller or processor, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 60"". 24. Furthermore, under Article 16 of the Data Protection Act, ""the restricted formation shall take measures and impose sanctions against controllers or processors who fail to comply with the obligations arising from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 and this Act \[...\]"". 25. The restricted panel notes, without this being contested by the company in the context of the present procedure, that the ""one-stop shop"" mechanism provided for by Article 56 of the GDPR is not intended to apply in this case, as DISCORD INC. does not have an establishment on the territory of a Member State of the European Union. Consequently, each national supervisory authority is competent to monitor compliance with the GDPR on the territory of the Member State to which it belongs in accordance with Article 55 of the Regulation, for processing operations carried out by DISCORD INC. on persons residing on that territory. The CNIL is therefore competent to monitor compliance with the GDPR of processing operations carried out by DISCORD INC. involving persons residing on French territory. C. On the failure to comply with the obligation to define and respect a data retention period proportionate to the purpose of the processing 26. Under Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, personal data must be ""kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data are processed \[...\]"". 27. 27. The rapporteur notes that the company has not defined a data retention policy and that its register of processing activities does not mention any retention period for the personal data processed. For example, the data have been kept for more than six years, since the DISCORD service was launched, and the company does not regularly delete or archive the data after a certain period. It notes that there are 2,474,000 million French user accounts in the DISCORD database that have not been used for more than three years and 58,000 accounts that have not been used for more than five years, without the company providing any particular explanation or justification for keeping these inactive accounts. 28. The rapporteur recalls that the CNIL's reference framework on the processing of personal data implemented for the purpose of managing commercial activities of 3 February 2022 specifies - with regard to commercial activities involving the creation of an online account by customers - that the data is intended to be kept until the user deletes the account. However, it points out that users often stop using these accounts without deleting them, which leads them to remain indefinitely. In such cases, the Commission recommends that accounts should be considered inactive after two years and deleted at the end of this period, unless the user expresses the wish to keep the account active. 29. In its defence, the company states that it did not have a written data retention policy in February 2021, but argues that it was nevertheless in compliance with Article 5 of the GDPR, as it had determined and implemented retention periods directly encoded in the DISCORD service itself. It states that the retention period implemented corresponds to the duration of the contractual relationship with its users, as well as to periods determined in accordance with its legal obligations and its security obligations, which it is required to respect, without however specifying them. 30. In addition, the company raises the unenforceability of the CNIL recommendations, in particular the CNIL reference framework of 3 February 2022, which is subsequent to the online audit conducted on 17 November 2020, and reserves the hypothesis ""for commercial activities that involve the creation of an online account by customers (e.g. dating sites or social networks), \[where\] data may be kept until the user deletes the account"". The company also points to the specific nature of the Discord Service, which is a communication service involving the maintenance of so-called inactive accounts for the benefit of the users themselves. 31. The Panel notes that in the course of the monitoring procedure the company stated: ""Discord does not have a written data retention policy. \[The company \[...\] is currently developing a data retention policy to delete inactive accounts when the company can conclude that the user has abandoned his account"". In this respect, the register of processing activities provided by the company during the monitoring procedure does not mention any retention period for the personal data processed. 32. The findings of the CNIL inspection delegation confirm that there were 2,474,000 French user accounts in the DISCORD database that had not been used for more than three years and 58,000 accounts that had not been used for more than five years. 33. The restricted formation recalls that the obligation to keep data ""for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed \[...\]"" results from Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, which is a mandatory provision. The Commission has consistently held that the retention of online accounts created free of charge without any action by users beyond a certain period of time leads to the retention of data indefinitely, in breach of the GDPR. The restricted formation considers that the company cannot rely in this case on the maintenance of a contractual relationship to keep indefinitely the accounts of users who are totally inactive but who have not unsubscribed, since the account was created free of charge and an inactive user who wishes to use the service again can do so by recreating an account at any time. 34. Thus, the panel considers that the company has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, the nature of the service offered to users being irrelevant. 35. 35. It notes, however, that DISCORD INC. now has a written policy on the duration of the retention of personal data processed, which provides in particular for the deletion of accounts after two years of inactivity by the user. The panel therefore considers that the company has complied with the obligations arising from Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR. D. On the breach of the transparency obligation 36. Article 12(1) of the GDPR provides that ""the controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 as well as any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 in respect of the processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible manner, in clear and simple language, in particular for any information specifically intended for a child"". 37. 37. The rapporteur noted that, during the inspection carried out on 17 November 2020, the CNIL delegation observed that after clicking on the link entitled ""Privacy"" in the footer, a page opened in the browser with the words ""DISCORD PRIVACY POLICY"". While the privacy policy was easily accessible from the registration form, it was only available in English, as of 23 June 2020 at the time of the online check. 38. In its defence, the company states that the privacy policy was already communicated to users in French at the time of the CNIL inspection. However, a technical problem that occurred on 16 November 2020 temporarily prevented the French translation of the privacy policy from appearing on the website during the inspection. It added that it had identified the technical problem and quickly implemented the necessary measures to resolve it, specifying that the French version of the privacy policy had become accessible again on 3 December 2020. 39. In the light of these elements, the rapporteur proposes that the restricted formation should not uphold the breach of Article 12 of the GDPR. 40. The restricted formation takes note of the elements provided by the company and considers that this breach is not established. E. On the breach of the obligation to inform individuals 41. Article 13 of the GDPR lists the information to be provided by the controller to data subjects when their personal data are collected directly from them. Article 13(2) of the GDPR provides that ""in addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the data subject, at the time the personal data are obtained, with the following additional information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing : (a) the period of time for which the personal data will be kept or, where this is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period \[...\]"". 42. The guidelines on transparency under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, clarifying the provisions of Article 13, state that ""the retention period \[...\] should be formulated in such a way that the data subject can assess, depending on his or her situation, what the retention period will be in the case of specific data or for specific purposes. The controller cannot simply state in general terms that personal data will be kept for as long as the legitimate purpose of the processing requires. Where appropriate, different storage periods should be mentioned for the different categories of personal data and/or the different purposes of processing, including periods for archival purposes. 43. The rapporteur notes that the retention periods were stated in a generic manner, without being sufficiently explicit, as they were specified in the following terms: 'We generally retain personal data for the time necessary to fulfil the purposes defined in this document. To dispose of personal data, we may anonymise it, delete it or take other necessary steps. Data may remain for some time in the form of back-up copies or for commercial purposes. The rapporteur therefore concludes that there is a breach of the obligation to provide information. 44. In its defence, the company states that Article 13(2)(a) of the GDPR does not require the retention period as such to be provided, but instead leaves it to the controller to provide the 'criteria used to determine the retention period'. It added that in order to comply with this obligation, DISCORD INC. provided users with the said criteria, namely the duration necessary to achieve the purposes explicitly described in the privacy policy. Finally, the company adds that it has developed an information note that provides more details regarding the retention of personal data and that a link to the page ""How long does Discord keep your information"" has been included directly in the Privacy Policy. 45. The Panel considers that at the time of the online check, the retention periods were stated in a generic manner and were not sufficiently explicit. There was a lack of information on the retention periods as there were no specific periods or criteria for determining the retention periods. In any event, the restricted panel recalled that recourse to ""criteria used to determine this duration"" is only permitted when it is not possible to provide a precise duration. However, this is not the case in the present case with regard to the processing operations carried out by the company. As a result, individuals could not know the retention periods established by DISCORD INC. even though this information is important in order to guarantee ""fair and transparent processing"" since it helps to ensure that users have control over the processing of their data. 46. 46. Consequently, the Panel considers that the company has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 13(2)(a) of the GDPR. It nevertheless notes the measures taken by DISCORD INC. in the course of the procedure and considers that the company has now complied on this point. F. On the breach of the obligation to respect the right to object 47. Article 21(1) of the GDPR provides that ""the data subject shall have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to the processing of personal data relating to him or her based on Article 6(1)(e) or (f), including profiling based on those provisions. The controller shall no longer process the personal data, unless it can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests and rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. 48. The rapporteur noted that among the personal data processing operations carried out by DISCORD INC. is the processing operation ""Use data to improve Discord"", the purpose of which is to use the information collected via the services to ""help \[the company\] improve the content and functionality of the services, better understand \[its\] users and improve the service"". According to the company's processing register, the purpose of improving the service leads to the collection of the following data: IP address, user ID, operating system, chat servers joined, contacts/friends, games played, possible subscription to the premium version of discord, purchases made, functionalities used, activities on the platform, etc. The company adds that when the user objects to their data being used to improve the DISCORD service, they must go to the settings and deactivate the functionality. In this case, the company removes the association of the alias with the user ID, which then, according to the company, prevents it from being able to associate the data collected with the pseudonymous alias with the user ID. The rapporteur noted that the information provided by the company shows that the personal data of the person concerned continue to be processed, even though the user has expressed his wish to object. The mere break in the link between, on the one hand, the usage data processed and stored with the pseudonym alias and, on the other hand, the user's identifier associated with his or her account does not appear to be sufficient to consider that the user's right to object to the processing of his or her data for this purpose would be duly taken into account and effective. 49. In its defence, the company considers that the possibility of deactivating the ""Use data to improve Discord"" function with a slider button does not constitute the exercise of the right to object within the meaning of Article 21(1) of the GDPR. It stated that it had made a clear distinction in its replies to the delegation of control: - on the one hand, a setting option that can be used via an online slider button without the need for a justification relating to the user's particular situation: in this case, the data are pseudonymised; - on the other hand, the right to object, which is exercised in accordance with Article 21(1) of the GDPR. In this case, users shall submit their request to DISCORD or its representative, giving reasons relating to their particular situation to enable the company to assess whether this condition is met. This right shall not be exercised via the slider button. 50. The company considers that sanctioning it on this point would have the effect of dissuading organisations from implementing ""privacy by design"" and of pushing them to provide only the objection mechanism provided for in Article 21 of the GDPR. 51. In the light of these elements, the rapporteur proposes that the restricted formation should not retain this failure. 52. The restricted formation notes that it emerges from the elements communicated by the company that the existence of the slider button allowing the deactivation of the ""Use data to improve Discord"" function is a setting that is not intended to constitute the exercise of the right to object within the meaning of Article 21 of the RGPD and that DISCORD INC. offers an objection procedure that complies with this article. 53. In these circumstances, the Panel considers that the breach of Article 21 of the GDPR is not established. G. On the breach of the obligation to ensure data protection by default 54. Article 25(2) states that ""the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of processing are processed. This applies to the amount of personal data collected, the extent of their processing, their storage period and their accessibility. In particular, these measures shall ensure that, by default, personal data are not made accessible to an indeterminate number of natural persons without the involvement of the natural person concerned. 55. The rapporteur notes that, by default, the user has to perform several actions to exit the DISCORD application on Windows and Linux. The application is set to remain active even when the user closes the main window (by selecting the ""X"" icon in the top right-hand corner), thus allowing voice communication to continue without taking up any space on the computer desktop. Only a small indicator shows that the application is active. This indicator was present in the taskbar, which is located at the bottom right of the screen in Microsoft Windows, next to the date and time. The rapporteur concludes that this setting of the application led to the possibility that the user's personal data could be communicated to third parties through the voice lounge, even though the user thought, in the absence of specific information that was sufficiently visible and clear, that the collection of such data had ceased when he or she had chosen to close the application window. 56. In its defence, the company states that one of the primary functionalities of DISCORD is to be able to chat with friends, often while doing something else, such as playing a video game or surfing the web. According to the company, the user only wants to see the game he is playing on his screen and any intrusion on his screen would affect his game and disturb him. It considers that when a user logged into a voice chat room clicks on the ""X"" icon in the top right-hand corner, he or she does not think of leaving the application and is aware that he or she is still logged into the chat room. According to the company, they are repeatedly told that to leave a chat room they must click on the ""logout"" button (a phone icon with a cross in a red circle). 57. In addition, the company considers that it is essential to take into account the functioning of similar applications in order to assess the level of expectation of DISCORD users. The company refers to the EDPS Guidelines on data protection by design and by default, which state that ""processing should correspond to the reasonable expectations of the data subjects"". According to the company, the rapporteur cannot conclude that there is a breach of data protection by design without first determining whether users have been misled or whether the processing and operation of the application is unexpected, harmful or discriminatory to its users. According to the company, the user can legitimately expect the DISCORD application to function in this way because, on the one hand, applications on Windows and Linux operating systems function in the same way (according to the company, when the user clicks on the ""X"" icon, he or she expects the application to function in the same way), the user expects that this action will only close a window and put the application in the background) and, on the other hand, the user's expectation when clicking on the ""X"" icon is to put the application in the background so that they can continue chatting while performing other actions on their computer. Furthermore, the company explains that the closing modalities can be changed through a setting available to users, who can decide on a single action to be performed to close the application. 58. Finally, the company states that it has now implemented a pop-up window that tells users of Windows and Linux operating systems that the DISCORD application is still running when the window has been closed and that these settings can be changed directly by the user. 59. Firstly, the restricted formation notes that, if a user connected to a voice room closes the application window by clicking on the ""X"" icon at the top right (in Microsoft Windows), he or she is in fact only putting the application in the background and not leaving it; he or she is therefore still connected to the voice room. However, in Microsoft Windows, and more generally in the symbolism commonly used in computing, clicking on the ""X"" at the top right of the last visible window of an application usually exits it. Minimising the application in the background is usually achieved by clicking on a ""-"" icon. However, the behaviour of DISCORD is different. Therefore, the restricted formation considers that the user should be given specific information so that he is aware of this difference. However, this was not the case at the time the online check was carried out. 60. The restricted formation specifies that, if there are applications with communication functions that are in reality only reduced in the background after the user has clicked on the close cross, generally, either the applications that have such a behaviour inform the user with a pop-up window when the cross is first clicked that the application will go into the background but will continue to function; or, by default, the background reduction behaviour is not activated and it is up to the user to set it manually. In the present case, before the pop-up window mentioned above was put in place, background minimisation took place by default from the first use after installation, without any warning or clear information. 61. Consequently, the company cannot validly maintain that the application's operation corresponds to the user's expectations, insofar as other applications inform the person or allow the user to make this specific setting himself. 62. Secondly, the restricted formation noted that this default setting of the application - which provided that it was not exited when the main window was closed - led to the possibility that the user's personal data could be communicated to third parties without the user necessarily being aware of this. Indeed, the user was not necessarily aware that his or her words continued to be transmitted and heard by the other members present in the voice room. The restricted formation noted that such a setting, in the absence of sufficiently clear and visible information, presented significant risks for users, in particular of intrusion into their private life. 63. Consequently, the Restricted Panel considers that the company failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 25(2) of the GDPR, which requires data protection by default. 64. It nevertheless notes that DISCORD INC. has now set up a ""pop-up"" window which, when the window has been closed for the first time, alerts those connected to a voice room that the DISCORD application is still running and that these settings can be changed directly by the user. H. On the breach of the obligation to ensure data security 65. According to Article 32 of the GDPR, ""taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks, varying in likelihood and severity, to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia, as necessary: \[...\] (b) means to ensure the continuing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of the processing systems and services; c) \[...\] (d) a procedure to regularly test, analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the processing"". 66. The rapporteur noted that, when creating an account on DISCORD, a password consisting of six characters including letters and numbers was accepted. The rapporteur considered that such passwords, without sufficiently complex criteria and without any additional security measures, do not ensure the security of the personal data processed by the company and prevent unauthorised third parties from having access to these data. 67. In its defence, the company contests the rapporteur's analysis and considers that it has put in place measures to ensure a high level of security for its users' access to its system, including measures to prevent brute force attacks: limiting login attempts to one per second; verification by email or SMS to validate the login when the company receives a login request from an IP address outside the area of the previous login IP address; rejection of commonly used and compromised passwords and implementation of a ""captcha"" for logins from new IP address ranges. 68. 68. The company also made changes to its password security processes in the course of the sanction proceedings: - it now requires French users to set passwords that are at least eight characters long, with at least three of those characters being lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers or special characters; - after ten unsuccessful login attempts, the company requires the resolution of a ""captcha"". 69. The restricted formation considers that the length and complexity of a password remain basic criteria for assessing its strength. In this respect, it notes that the need for a strong password is also emphasised by the Agence nationale de sécurité des systèmes d'information. 70. By way of clarification, the restricted panel recalls that to ensure a sufficient level of security and meet the requirements of password strength, if authentication provides for restricted access to the account, the CNIL recommends, in its deliberation No. 2017-012 of 19 January 2017, that the password should comprise at least eight characters, containing at least three of the four categories of characters (upper case, lower case, numbers and special characters) and that authentication should include a restriction on access to the account, such as a timeout on access to the account after several failed attempts (temporary suspension of access, the duration of which increases with the number of attempts), the implementation of a mechanism to protect against automated and intensive submissions of attempts (such as a ""captcha"") and/or the blocking of the account after several unsuccessful authentication attempts. 71. In the present case, the Panel notes that a password of six characters including letters and numbers was accepted at the time of the online check. The restricted formation considered that, in view of the undemanding rules governing their composition, as well as the volume of personal data to be protected, the robustness of the passwords accepted by the company was too low, leading to a risk of compromise of the associated accounts and the personal data they contained, despite the additional security measures put in place before the sanction procedure. 72. Under these circumstances, in view of the risks incurred by individuals, the restricted panel considers that the above facts constitute a breach of Article 32 of the GDPR, since the company's password management policy was not sufficiently robust and binding to guarantee data security within the meaning of that Article. 73. However, the Commission notes that, in the course of the sanction procedure, the company made changes in this respect and complied with the provisions of Article 32 of the GDPR. I. On the failure to carry out a data protection impact assessment 74. Article 35(1) of the GDPR provides that 'where a type of processing, in particular through the use of new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall carry out an analysis of the impact of the proposed processing operations on the protection of personal data prior to the processing'. 75. Recital 91 of the GDPR provides, inter alia, that an impact assessment ""should apply in particular to large-scale processing operations intended to process a considerable volume of personal data at regional, national or supranational level, which may affect a significant number of data subjects \[...\]"". 76. The rapporteur considers that the company should have carried out a data protection impact assessment (hereinafter ""DPIA""), in the light of two criteria that make it possible to consider that the processing was likely to give rise to a high risk: the collection of data on a large scale and the collection of data concerning vulnerable persons. The rapporteur considers that the processing operations carried out by the company are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and concludes that DISCORD INC. has failed to comply with the obligations of Article 35 of the RGPD by not carrying out a data protection impact assessment. 77. In its defence, DISCORD INC. states that it considered that a DPIA was not necessary as it processes only very limited data, namely those necessary to allow users to create their account, to provide its services, to fulfil its commitments to its users and to comply with its legal obligations; it does not carry out any of the processing operations listed in Article 35(3) of the GDPR as requiring an impact assessment; it does not carry out any of the processing operations for which the CNIL has considered that a DPIA is required, in accordance with the list of processing operations for which such an analysis is necessary published on 6 November 2018; it does not process data on ""children"", since it only addresses users over the age of fifteen who have a sufficient degree of maturity to use its services. 78. The company further points out that the G29 guidelines on DPIA and how to determine whether processing is ""likely to result in a high risk"" for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 recall that a DPIA is not automatic even when the processing meets two of the nine criteria set out among those to be considered. 79. Finally, the company explains that, even though it was not required to do so under the GDPR, it has since carried out two DPIAs for its processing related to the DISCORD service and its core services, which concluded that the processing is not likely to result in a high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms. 80. Firstly, the panel considers that by processing the data of more than \[...\] users in France, DISCORD INC. is carrying out large-scale processing of personal data. Moreover, the panel notes that the application is also intended to be used by children aged fifteen, of which DISCORD INC. is fully aware, since it itself states that it is ""committed to protecting the privacy of children and has therefore put in place measures to ensure that no child under the minimum age defined for each country can access Discord services and create an account"". 81. The restricted formation recalls that, according to recital 38 of the GDPR, ""children deserve specific protection with regard to their personal data because they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards involved and of their rights in relation to the processing of personal data"" and that, pursuant to Article 1 of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child, ""a child means every human being below the age of eighteen years"". Although, pursuant to Article 8 of the GDPR and Article 45 of the Data Protection Act, a minor may consent alone to the processing of personal data in relation to the direct provision of information society services from the age of fifteen, the fact remains that a minor between the ages of fifteen and eighteen is still a child, and therefore a vulnerable person. 82. The restricted formation recalls, by way of clarification, that the aforementioned G29 guidelines on DPIA, amended and last adopted on 4 October 2017, set out a list of nine criteria to be taken into account in order to give a more concrete vision of processing operations that require an impact assessment due to a high inherent risk. These criteria include the collection of personal data on a large scale and the collection of data on vulnerable persons. The Guidelines add that ""in most cases, the controller may consider that a processing operation meeting two criteria requires an DPIA"". 83. With regard to the first criterion relating to large-scale data collection, the Guidelines explain that account should be taken, in particular, of the number of data subjects, the volume of data and/or the range of different data elements processed, the duration or permanence of the data processing activity and the geographical scope of the processing activity. With regard to the second criterion relating to the collection of data relating to vulnerable persons, the Guidelines indicate that the processing of data relating to vulnerable persons is a criterion because of the increased power imbalance between the data subjects and the controller, which means that the former may be unable to consent or object easily to the processing of their data or to exercise their rights. Among these vulnerable persons, the Guidelines mention children ""who may be seen as unable to object or to give informed and considered consent to the processing of their data. 84. Consequently, the Panel considers that the company should have carried out an impact assessment of the data processing implemented, in view of the volume of data processed by the company and the use of its services by children. 85. Secondly, the Restricted Panel notes that, while the processing operations carried out by the company are not included in the ""list of types of processing operations for which an analysis relating to data protection is required"" published by the CNIL (Deliberation No. 2018-327 of 11 October 2018), they are also not included in the ""list of types of processing operations for which an impact analysis relating to data protection is not required"" (Deliberation No. 2019-118 of 12 September 2019). 86. Thirdly, the restricted panel notes that the company has, in the context of the present procedure, carried out two DPIAs, which were transmitted to the CNIL and concluded that the processing is not likely to give rise to a high risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals. It nevertheless notes that although the impact assessments carried out concluded that there was no high risk, it is nonetheless imperative that they be carried out beforehand in order to ensure this. 87. In view of all these elements, the restricted panel considers that the company has failed to comply with the obligations of Article 35 of the GDPR. III. On the corrective measures and their publicity 88. Under the terms of Article 20, III, of the Act of 6 January 1978 as amended, ""When the data controller or its processor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or from this Act, the president of the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés may also, where applicable, after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, where applicable, in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted formation of the Commission with a view to pronouncing, after an adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures: \[...\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine that may not exceed 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the total annual worldwide turnover for the previous financial year, whichever is higher. In the cases referred to in Articles 5 and 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, these ceilings shall be increased to EUR 20 million and 4% of the said turnover respectively. The restricted formation shall take into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same Article 83."" 89. Article 83 of the RGPD provides that ""each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed pursuant to this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive"", before specifying the elements to be taken into account in deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the amount of that fine. 90. Firstly, as regards the principle of imposing a fine, the company asked the restricted formation not to impose a fine on it, insofar as it contested all the breaches of which it was accused. As regards the amount of the fine, the company considers that its good faith and willingness to cooperate were not effectively taken into account in the rapporteur's proposal. 91. The restricted formation recalls that it must take into account, when imposing an administrative fine, the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, seriousness and duration of the breach, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and the categories of personal data affected by the breach. 92. The Panel notes that the breaches committed by the company concern obligations relating to the fundamental principles of personal data protection and that five breaches are established. 93. The restricted panel then notes that the processing implemented by DISCORD INC. concerns a very large number of persons located in France, since more than \[...\] DISCORD user accounts were registered in France in January 2021, including minors. 94. Consequently, the restricted formation considers that an administrative fine should be imposed with regard to the breaches constituted by Articles 5(1)(e), 13, 25(2), 32 and 35 of the GDPR. 95. The restricted formation recalls that breaches relating to Articles 5(1)(e) and 13 of the GDPR are breaches of principles which may be subject, under Article 83 of the GDPR, to an administrative fine of up to EUR 20 000 000 or up to 4 % of the worldwide annual turnover in the preceding business year, whichever is higher. 96. The Restricted Section also recalls that administrative fines must be both dissuasive and proportionate. In particular, it considers that the company's activity and financial situation must be taken into account when determining the amount of the administrative fine. In this respect, it notes that DISCORD INC. has a turnover of approximately USD \[...\] in 2019 and more than USD \[...\] in 2020. 97. 97. Furthermore, the panel notes the efforts made by the company to comply throughout the procedure, as well as the fact that its business model is not based on the exploitation of personal data. 98. 98. Therefore, in view of these elements, the restricted panel considers that the imposition of an administrative fine of EUR 800 000 appears justified. 99. Secondly, with regard to the publicity of the decision to impose a penalty, the company maintains that such a measure would cause it unjust harm and does not appear justified in view of the level of protection of personal data that it provided to its users at the time of the inspection and that it continues to provide to all its users. It considers that such publicity would lead users to believe that their personal data are not being processed in accordance with the law, whereas they are properly informed of the processing of their data, the security of their data is ensured by robust measures and the exercise of their rights is respected. 100. The restricted formation considers that the publicity of the sanction is justified in view of the number of persons concerned, the number of breaches committed and their seriousness. FOR THESE REASONS The CNIL's select committee, after deliberation, decides to : - to impose an administrative fine of 800,000 (eight hundred thousand) euros on DISCORD INC. for breaches of Articles 5(1)(e), 13, 25(2), 32 and 35 of the GDPR; - to make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its decision, which will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. The Chairman Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be appealed to the Council of State within four months of its notification."

Facts and procedure 1. FREE (hereinafter ""the company""), whose registered office is located at 8 rue de la Ville-L'Evêque in Paris (75008), is a subsidiary of the ILIAD group, which is a fixed telecommunications operator. Created in 1999, the company has approximately 179 employees. 2. For the year 2020, the company had a turnover of approximately EUR \[...\], for a net result of approximately EUR \[...\]. In 2021, the company had approximately \[...\] subscribers, \[...\]. 3. Between October 2018 and November 2019, the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (hereinafter ""the CNIL"" or ""the Commission"") received 41 complaints against the company. Of these complaints, 10 were examined in the context of the present sanction procedure. The complainants reported difficulties in exercising their rights of access or deletion. Some of these complaints also concerned the security of the personal data of the company's customers. 4. On 8 February 2019, the company submitted a notification of a personal data breach to the CNIL, followed on 22 February 2019 by a supplementary notification. These notifications indicated that approximately 4,100 Freeboxes had been put back into circulation without being reconditioned, i.e. without the previous subscriber's data being erased from the Freebox's hard drive. 5. Two on-site inspections, at the premises of Free and then Free Mobile, were carried out on January 21 and 22, 2020. 6. The minutes No. 2019-188/1 and No. 2019-188/2, drawn up by the delegation on the day of the inspections, were notified to the company on 23 January 2020. On that occasion, requests for additional information and documents were sent to the company. The Iliad Group's legal department responded by emails dated 3 and 10 February 2020. 7. A document check was also carried out at Free and Free Mobile on 3 June 2020. The Iliad Group's legal department responded by email dated June 29, 2020. 8. For the purpose of investigating these elements, the President of the Commission appointed Mr. François PELLEGRINI as rapporteur on December 17, 2020, on the basis of Article 22 of the amended Act of January 6, 1978. 9. Finally, a request for additional information was sent to the company by letter dated 16 March 2022. The Iliad Group's legal department responded by letter dated March 31, 2022. 10. On 21 April 2022, the rapporteur sent the company a report detailing the breaches of the GDPR that he considered to have occurred in this case. 11. This report proposed that the restricted panel impose an administrative fine and an injunction to bring the processing into compliance with the provisions of Article L.34-5 of the French Post and Electronic Telecommunications Code (CPCE) and Articles 7-1, 15, 17, 32 and 33 of the RGPD, together with a penalty payment for each day of delay at the end of a period of three months following notification of the restricted panel's decision. It also proposed that the decision be made public, but that it should no longer be possible to identify the company by name after two years from its publication. 12. On 2 June 2022, the company submitted its observations in response to the sanction report. 13. On 13 July 2022, the rapporteur sent his reply to the company's observations. 14. On 26 August 2022, the company submitted further observations in response to the rapporteur's comments. 15. On 5 September 2022, the rapporteur informed the company and the chairman of the restricted formation of the closure of the investigation. On the same day, the chairman of the panel sent a notice to attend the meeting of the panel on 29 September 2022. 16. On 14 September 2022, the company produced a certificate from its service provider, the company \[...\], relating to the supply of telephone numbers and e-mail addresses for a commercial prospecting campaign for the period from 2 to 6 December 2019. 17. 17. On 21 September 2022, the chairman of the panel notified the company that the hearing would be postponed until Monday 26 September 2022 and asked it to notify the company \[...\] so that one of its representatives could attend the panel's meeting. 18. 18. FREE and the rapporteur presented oral observations at the meeting of the restricted formation. 19. Mr \[...\] and Mr \[...\], whose hearing was deemed useful, were heard pursuant to Article 42 of Decree no. 2019-536 of 29 May 2019. II. Reasons for the decision A. On the failure to obtain the consent of the person concerned by a direct marketing operation by means of electronic mail and SMS 20. According to Article L.34-5 of the CPCE : ""Direct prospecting by means of an automated electronic communications system \[...\], a fax machine or electronic mail using the contact details of a natural person \[...\] who has not previously expressed his or her consent to receive direct prospecting by this means is prohibited. For the purposes of this Article, consent shall mean any free, specific and informed expression of will by which a person agrees that personal data concerning him or her may be used for direct marketing purposes. \[...\] "". 21. According to Article 4(11) of the GDPR: ""For the purposes of this Regulation, \[...\] ""consent"" of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of his wishes by which the data subject signifies his agreement, by a declaration or by a clear positive act, to personal data relating to him being processed."" 22. According to Article 7(1) of the GDPR: ""In cases where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has given his consent to the processing of personal data relating to him"". 23. The rapporteur to propose to the restricted formation to consider that the company has failed to fulfil its obligations resulting from Articles L. 34-5 of the CPCE and 7(1) of the RGPD, as clarified by the provisions of Article 4(11) of the RGPD, is based on the fact that FREE, which carries out commercial prospecting operations by electronic means via a database of personal data collected by its service provider, the company \[......\], is not able to provide proof of unambiguous, specific, free and informed consent from prospective customers before they were canvassed during a commercial prospecting campaign by electronic means (email and SMS) in December 2019. In order to consider the breach as constituted, the rapporteur relied on the elements gathered during the on-site inspection operations (Official Statements No. 2019-188/1 and No. 2019-188/2) as well as on additional documents transmitted at the end of these verifications, in particular a document indicating that the company had ""obtained in December 2019 from this partner files of prospective customers in order to carry out a commercial canvassing campaign by SMS and email"" and that ""this single campaign \[?\] was only carried out in December 2019 and was not continued in 2020"". 24. In its defence, the company submits that it 'did indeed consider carrying out a canvassing campaign by SMS and email to non-subscribers and signed an estimate with its partner \[...\] \[the company \[...\]\] for this purpose'. However, it indicated that it had expressed itself incorrectly in the document submitted as an exhibit and that it could not be held responsible for any breach because this campaign 'was cancelled before it was even launched'. It added that one of the reasons why the campaign was not carried out was ""that it was originally intended to promote Free's fibre-optic services. Because of a shortage, between October 2019 and January 2020, of the user equipment needed for the installation of optical fibre \[...\], Free ultimately did not wish to promote services for which it could not ensure delivery. At the meeting of the restricted panel, the company reiterated these points. 25. 25. The restricted formation notes that the document on which the rapporteur relies contains erroneous elements and that the company has provided convincing explanations on the circumstances in which the error occurred. 26. In these circumstances, the restricted formation considers that it is not established that the electronic commercial prospecting campaign referred to was carried out and that the elements of the debate do not allow the conclusion to be drawn that there was a breach of the obligations resulting from Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE and Article 7-1 of the GDPR. B. On the breaches relating to the exercise of rights 27. According to Article 12 of the GDPR: "" 1. The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 as well as any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 in relation to the processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible manner, in clear and simple language, in particular for any information specifically intended for a child \[...\]. 2. \[...\]. 3. The controller shall provide the data subject with information on the measures taken in response to a request made pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 as soon as possible and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. If necessary, this period may be extended by two months, taking into account the complexity and number of requests. The controller shall inform the data subject of this extension and the reasons for the postponement within one month of receipt of the request. Where the data subject submits his or her request in electronic form, the information shall be provided electronically where possible, unless the data subject requests otherwise. 4. If the controller does not comply with the request made by the data subject, it shall inform the data subject without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request of the reasons for its inaction and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and of seeking judicial remedy. \[...\] "". 28. According to Article 15 of the GDPR: "" 1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data relating to him or her are being processed and, where such data are being processed, access to such personal data and the following information: \[...\] (g) where the personal data are not obtained from the data subject, any available information as to their source. \[...\] 3. The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data being processed. \[...\]. 4. The right to obtain a copy referred to in paragraph 3 shall not affect the rights and freedoms of others. "" 29. According to Article 17 of the GDPR: "" 1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to him or her as soon as possible and the controller shall have an obligation to erase such personal data as soon as possible, where one of the following grounds applies: (a) the personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; \[...\]. "" 1. On the breach of the obligation to respect the right of access 30. 30. The rapporteur, in proposing that the restricted panel consider that the company has failed to comply with its obligations under Article 15 of the GDPR with regard to the right of access, bases himself on five referrals to the CNIL, from Messrs \[...\] (complaint no. 19009149), \[...\] (complaint no. 19005208), \[...\] (complaint no. 19014037), \[...\] (complaint no. 19015831) and \[...\] (complaint no. 19016618). In these complaints, individuals reported difficulties in exercising this right, even though their requests had been received. 31. The rapporteur points out that these five referrals concern, inter alia, access to personal data and, of these five, four referrals specifically concern obtaining information on the source of their data. 32. 32. The rapporteur notes that it appears from the findings of the inspection procedure or from the information subsequently provided that the company did not respond within the prescribed time limits to the above-mentioned requests from the complainants to exercise their rights of access or that it gave them an incomplete reply as to the source of their data. 33. 33. In its defence, the company argued that, as regards the lack of a timely response, the procedures implemented had not been respected due to isolated human errors. It also argues that the small number of complaints noted in the report (2) should be compared with the number of requests it handles per year (approximately 600). Finally, the company indicates that these complaints predate the implementation of a new ticketing tool that it has been using since June 2019, which has made it possible to improve the procedure for handling requests to exercise rights. It therefore considers that these one-off malfunctions have now been resolved. 34. With regard to the requests for information on the source of the data, the company considers that, in accordance with the provisions of recital 63 of the GDPR and Article 15(4) of the GDPR, it is not obliged to respond to them if it would be obliged to reveal information that is a matter of business secrecy (the identity of the data broker who supplied the data). It maintains that in reality, the information sought by the applicants is the identity of the primary source of the applicant's data collection. It states that it has changed its procedures in the course of the sanction procedure, since it now asks its data brokers to provide it with the identity of the primary source of this collection, which the company in turn provides to the applicants. 35. 35. With regard to the lack of a response within the time limits, the restricted formation notes that it follows from Article 12 of the RGPD that when a request for the exercise of a right is addressed to him, the controller must provide the data subject with information on the measures taken to respond to his request as soon as possible and in any case within one month. The restricted formation also recalls that when the controller no longer holds all or part of the data on the person exercising his right of access (for example, the data have been deleted or the organisation has no data on the person), it must nevertheless reply to the applicant within a maximum period of one month. 36. As regards the information to be provided on the source of the data under Article 15 of the RGPD, the restricted formation notes firstly that it is clear from the aforementioned articles that the limitation of the right of access by ""the rights and freedoms of others"", which include business secrecy, applies only to Article 15-4 of the RGPD, relating to persons requesting a copy of their data, and not to Article 15-1 of the RGPD, relating to persons requesting information from a controller who is processing their data. In this case, the panel noted that the complainants were not asking the company to obtain a copy of their data or to give them access to their data, but only to provide them with information about the source of their data. The restricted panel therefore considers that Article 15-4 of the GDPR is inapplicable. In any event, it considers that Article 15-1 of the GDPR could only be limited under the conditions provided for in Article 23 of the GDPR, which is not the case here. 37. 37. Next, the restricted formation notes that any processing of personal data must comply with the principles set out in Article 5(1)(a) of the RGPD, which provides that personal data must be processed in a transparent manner with regard to the data subject. It points out that the transparency guidelines of the Article 29 Working Party, now the European Data Protection Committee, state that ""the source from which personal data originate"" is to be understood as ""the specific source of the data or, failing that, the nature of the sources (i.e. public and private sources) and the types of bodies, companies and sectors"". The restricted formation considers that the data subject's right of access constitutes a fundamental guarantee of the transparency of the data processing methods. It deduced that the controller must in principle communicate ""the specific source"" of the data and that the restriction of the right of access to indications of the ""nature of the sources, types of bodies, undertakings and sectors"" can only occur when the controller does not hold this information, as the identification of the specific source of the data subject's personal data is impossible. 38. The restricted formation also notes that the purpose of the right of access - Article 15 of the GDPR being clarified by Recital 63 - is to enable the data subject to become aware of the processing of his or her data and to verify its lawfulness. The exercise of this right therefore presupposes that the information provided is as accurate as possible. 39. The restricted formation considers that the refusal to communicate the identity of the data broker from whom the data subject's data were obtained, although the company has this information, and to limit the right of access to the ""primary source"" of the collection (i.e. the first actor in the chain to have collected the data subject's personal data), which, moreover, was not provided in the present case at the time of the check, amounts to preventing the data subject from being able to verify the lawfulness of the processing carried out by the controller and, in particular, the lawfulness of the data transmissions already made. The restricted formation therefore considers that the right to have the identity of the source of the data is necessary to enable the data subject to give his consent and to exercise the rights conferred on him by the GDPR, in particular the right to object, depending on the type of commercial prospecting carried out by the controller who obtained the data from brokers. 40. The restricted formation considers that a breach of the obligations of Articles 12 and 15 of the RGPD is constituted for all the above-mentioned complaints when the company did not process the access requests addressed to it within the time limit set, thus leaving the individuals in the dark about the data processed by the company concerning them, or when it provided them with an incomplete response regarding the source of their data. Furthermore, the restricted panel considered that the company had not provided, at the date of the end of the investigation, any evidence of compliance specifically with regard to the point concerning the source of the data. 2. On the failure to respect the right to erasure 41. 41. The rapporteur, in proposing that the restricted panel consider that the company has failed to comply with its obligations under Article 17 of the GDPR, relies on two referrals to the CNIL, from Messrs \[...\] (complaint no. 19009870) and \[...\] (complaint no. 19012463), in which the complainants mentioned their difficulties in exercising their right to erasure. 42. The rapporteur states that the parties concerned requested the deletion of their ""Free.fr"" e-mail account by sending, on February 10 and 3, 2019 respectively, a form dedicated to the ""deletion of a main Free access account"" on which it is specified that ""the actual deletion of the accounts requires a period of 48 hours after receipt of the letter"". 43. 43. The rapporteur notes that it is clear from the findings of the inspection procedure and the information subsequently provided that the complainants did not receive a response to their requests for deletion made by registered letter and that the measures to satisfy their requests for deletion were not implemented, since the ""SIEBEL"" customer database contained various personal data specific to the complainants, such as their connection identifier, surname, first name and postal address. In addition, the status of the complainants' ""free.fr"" e-mail account was indicated as ""active"". 44. In its defence, the company argued that requests for ""deletion of a 'free access' account are not requests for deletion within the meaning of the GDPR and are not subject to any legal time limit \[...\]"" but are ""similar to a request for termination of a contract"". The company concludes that ""it would be totally disproportionate to consider that \[these requests\] fall within the scope of Article 17 of the RGPD and the time limits set by Article 12.3 of the RGPD"". The company specifies that it is only required to ""respect the principle of limiting the retention of the data concerned, without this requiring the immediate deletion of all the data concerned"". In this sense, it indicates that it has a ""legal obligation to keep data associated with e-mail accounts for a period of 1 year"", in accordance with Article L. 34-1 of the CPCE. 45. On this point, the restricted panel first considers that the complainants' requests are clear, in that each of them was a request for the general deletion of an e-mail account, addressed to the company by the dedicated form implemented by it. This request necessarily implied a request for the deletion of personal data related to the use of the account. The company cannot therefore rely on the fact that this deletion request was not clear and processed as a deletion request within the meaning of the GDPR. 46. Secondly, the restricted formation considers that it follows from Article 12.3 of the GDPR that the controller must provide applicants with information on the measures taken following a request made pursuant to Article 17 of the GDPR within a maximum period of one month, which may be extended for a reasonable period in certain cases. However, it noted that the company did not respond to the complainants until 23 May 2022, i.e. approximately three years after Mr \[...\] and Mr \[...\] had exercised their rights. This delay in responding violates Article 12.3 of the GDPR. 47. 47. Finally, the restricted formation considers that although the request for deletion of an e-mail account does not necessarily imply the deletion of all the data relating to that account (some data may be kept with an intermediate archive status), a breach of Article 17(1)(a) of the RGPD is in any event characterised in the present case since the status of the account was active and the e-mail was still accessible to the data subjects several years after they made their requests. 48. The restricted formation considers that a breach of the obligations arising from Articles 12 and 17 of the GDPR is constituted since it was incumbent on the company to process the request for deletion of the complainants' personal data within the time limits set. 49. The Commission notes that, in the context of the present procedure, the company has demonstrated that it has taken measures to comply with the obligations arising from Article 17 of the GDPR. C. On the breach of the obligation to ensure the security of personal data 50. According to Article 32(1) of the GDPR: ""Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks, varying in likelihood and severity, to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia, as necessary: a) \[...\] ; (b) means to ensure the continuing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; c) \[...\] ; (d) a procedure to regularly test, analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of processing. "" 1. On passwords for access to customer accounts 51. 51. The rapporteur, in proposing that the restricted formation consider that the company failed to comply with its obligations under Article 32 of the RGPD, bases himself firstly on the fact that the password generated randomly by the company when a user account is created on the company's website, during a recovery procedure or when the password is renewed, is eight characters long and may only contain one type of character. Secondly, the rapporteur notes that all the passwords generated when a user account was created on the company's website were stored in the clear in the company's subscriber database until 23 January 2020. Finally, the rapporteur notes that the delegation was informed that the password that is generated when a user account is created on the company's website is sent by e-mail or post to the user and is indicated in clear text in the body of the message. Similarly, the rapporteur notes that three referrals from Messrs \[...\] (complaint no. 19018181), \[...\] (complaint no. 18023964) and \[...\] (complaint no. 19013170) show that the password associated with the 'free.fr' e-mail account is sent to the user by e-mail or post and indicated in plain text in the body of the message. 52. In its defence, the company argues that, as a data controller, it is free to choose the security measures to be put in place. In this regard, it argued that the recommendations of the CNIL or the Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information (ANSSI) cited in the report were not mandatory. Consequently, the company considers that no breach can be retained in the absence of a ""data breach that affected access to the subscriber's area"". 53. The company then argues that, at the time of the inspection, subscribers were encouraged to change their password on their subscriber area. The company also stated that the initial password it had assigned was very strong and that the subscriber area only allowed access to ""basic"" information and not to sensitive information. Finally, the company announced that it has taken several steps to comply with the obligations arising from Article 32 of the RGPD with regard to password security by strengthening the robustness of passwords generated or created by the company and by making it compulsory to renew passwords when recovering them or when logging in for the first time. The company also indicated that it had stopped storing passwords in clear text in the database and that it had stopped communicating passwords in clear text (in particular, by stopping the transmission of new subscribers' passwords in clear text by e-mail, and by requiring new subscribers to create their own passwords), which must comply with the CNIL's recommendations on the subject, and the elimination of paper forms that must be filled out and sent by post to obtain the deletion of a ""Free Access"" account in which the communication of the password in clear text was required beforehand). 54. The restricted formation considers that in this case, the authentication procedure and the methods of storing and transmitting passwords implemented by the company are not adapted to the risk that the data subject would be exposed to if a third party were to capture their identifier and password. 55. It follows from the provisions of Article 32 of the GDPR that the controller is required to ensure that the automated data processing that it implements is sufficiently secure. The adequacy of the security measures is assessed, on the one hand, with regard to the characteristics of the processing and the risks it entails, and on the other hand, taking into account the state of knowledge and the cost of the measures. The implementation of a robust authentication policy is a basic security measure which generally contributes to compliance with the obligations of Article 32 of the RGPD. Despite the non-mandatory nature of Deliberation No. 2017-012 of 19 January 2017, the purpose of which is to provide recommendations on passwords, the CNIL guide on the security of personal data and the ANSSI technical note on passwords cited in the report, they set out basic security precautions corresponding to the state of the art and thus provide relevant information for assessing the sufficiency of the measures put in place by a data controller 56. In this case, with regard to the authentication procedure, the restricted formation considers that the use of a short or simple password without imposing specific categories of characters and without additional security measures may lead to attacks by unauthorised third parties such as ""brute force"" or ""dictionary"" attacks, which consist in successively and systematically testing numerous passwords and thus lead to a compromise of the associated accounts and the personal data they contain. Blocking measures are intended to limit these types of attacks. 57. The restricted formation notes that the Commission recommends in its Deliberation No. 2017-012 of 19 January 2017 - which is certainly not imperative but which provides relevant information on the measures that should be taken in terms of security - that, in order to meet the requirements of robustness of passwords and ensure a sufficient level of security where authentication is based, as in the present case, on a user ID and a password, without any additional security measure, the password must be at least 12 characters long and contain at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one number and one special character. Where the password is eight characters long, containing three of the four categories of characters (upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and special characters), it must be accompanied by an additional security measure to ensure a sufficient level of security and confidentiality. 58. The restricted formation notes that the need for a strong password is also underlined by the ANSSI, which specifies that ""a good password is above all a strong password, i.e. one that is difficult to find even with the help of automated tools. The strength of a password depends on its length and the number of possibilities for each character in it. A password made up of lower case letters, upper case letters, special characters and numbers is technically more difficult to discover than a password made up of lower case letters only. 59. Therefore, in the present case, the Panel considers that, in view of the volume and nature of the personal data that may be contained in the millions of subscriber accounts (in particular surname, first name, fixed line number, mobile phone number, e-mail address and invoices), the imposition by the latter of log-in passwords for customer accounts The imposition by the company of login passwords for the customers' accounts, consisting of only eight characters, which may be of a single character category, without any additional security measures, and the acceptance of their renewal in accordance with the same procedures, does not ensure the security of the personal data processed by the company, nor does it prevent unauthorised third parties from having access to the customers' personal data. 60. With regard to the procedure for storing passwords in clear text, the restricted panel notes that any person with access to FREE's customer database - whether it be information system administrators within the company or an attacker in the event of its compromise - could directly collect the clear text identifiers and passwords of each subscriber and thus access the information contained in their accounts, then possibly modify them, attempt to access other service accounts using these credentials (the same credentials and passwords are often used on several services) or resell them to other attackers. 61. With regard to the transmission of the password in clear text, the fact that these elements are transmitted in clear text via a simple e-mail or post makes them easily and immediately usable by a third party who would intercept them or have undue access to the user's e-mail, as long as these passwords are not time-limited or do not require modification when first used. This third party could then not only access all the personal data present in the Free user account of the person concerned (surname, first name, Freebox telephone number, postal address and e-mail address) but also download the invoices and the statement of consumption, proceed to the modification of the password, the e-mail address or the account options. In view of these potential consequences for the protection of personal data and the privacy of individuals, the restricted formation considers that the measures deployed to guarantee data security in this case are insufficient. 62. The restricted formation considers that breaches of the obligations arising from Article 32 of the RGPD are thus constituted because of the insufficient robustness of the passwords and their storage and transmission in clear text to the company's subscribers. 63. 63. The Commission notes that, in the context of the present procedure, the company has justified having taken measures to comply with the obligations arising from Article 32 of the RGPD. 2. On the repackaging of Freeboxes 64. 64. The rapporteur, in proposing that the restricted formation consider that the company has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 32 of the GDPR, relies on the fact that 4,137 boxes ""were put back into circulation without their reconditioning being perfect"", due in particular to an error that led to the deletion of a procedure (also known as a ""test sequence"") intended to erase the data stored on the hard disks of these ""Freebox"" boxes. 65. 65. In its defence, the company argues that the security obligation provided for in Article 32 of the GDPR is an obligation of means, which only requires it to implement security measures appropriate to the risks of the processing it is carrying out. It considers that in this case, the measures implemented were sufficient, given that this incident was the result of two successive human errors, that there was an ""anecdotal risk that the Freeboxes could be misused to store sensitive data"" and that the fact that only one subscriber reported these facts meant that only one ""effective access to the privacy of a former subscriber was made"", which ""reflects the limited likelihood of this risk materialising in practice"". The company also considers that the ""seriousness of this incident must be qualified given the nature of the data usually stored on Freeboxes"" - which is mainly limited to the recording of TV programmes and marginally to the storage of personal photos or videos. Finally, the company reminds that following the campaign to recall the boxes concerned, it sent a replacement Freebox to the 322 subscribers who did not return their Freeboxes, and that in any case, these were deactivated in July 2022. 66. The restricted formation considers first of all that the technical and organisational measures implemented were not sufficient with regard to the risk of data breach in the present case, since no alert process was implemented to monitor the effective completion of the test sequences including the deletion of data. This failure made it possible for unauthorised third parties, in this case the new owners of the 4,137 incorrectly reconfigured ""Freebox"" boxes, to access the data of former subscribers that would have been stored on the hard drives of these boxes. This data could be photos, personal videos or recordings of television programmes by the user. The restricted panel also recalled that it was not the data breach that was at issue, but the inadequacy of the security measures that made it possible for such a breach to occur. 67. Next, on the limited likelihood of the risk being realised due to the receipt of a single alert by the company, the restricted formation notes that this alert is indicative of the inadequacy of the technical and organisational measures implemented, which led to the discovery of the incident. 68. In addition, with regard to the nature of the data stored in the Freeboxes, the limited panel notes that the main and common use of Freeboxes is the recording of television programmes by the user, but considers that this common use does not rule out the possibility that some of the poorly reconditioned Freeboxes may contain personal photos or videos, which are highly personal. 69. Finally, the restricted formation considers that the fact that a replacement Freebox was sent to the 322 subscribers who did not return their old boxes does not make it possible to rule out the risk that the latter may have had access to the data of former subscribers. Indeed, on 31 March 2022 - more than three years after the incident was reported - the company indicated that this risk had still not been eliminated, since ""322 \[boxes\] are still being used by subscribers without us \[the company\] knowing whether the data recorded is that of the previous subscriber or the subscriber using it"". Furthermore, only the deactivation of the 322 unreturned Freeboxes eliminated this risk, and this deactivation took place in July 2022, more than three years after the incident was reported. 70. The restricted panel considers that there has been a breach of the obligations arising from Article 32 of the GDPR due to the inadequacy of the technical and organisational measures taken in the process of reconditioning the Freeboxes to ensure the security of the personal data of the company's subscribers. 71. 71. The Commission notes that, in the context of the present procedure, the company has justified having taken measures to comply with the obligations arising from Article 32 of the GDPR. D. On the failure to document any personal data breach 72. According to Article 33(5) of the GDPR: ""The controller shall document any personal data breach, indicating the facts concerning the personal data breach, its effects and the measures taken to remedy it. The documentation thus established shall enable the supervisory authority to verify compliance with this Article. "" 73. 73. The rapporteur, in proposing that the panel consider that the company has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 33 of the RGPD, argues that the data breach was not documented in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article. 74. In its defence, the company argues that Article 33 of the GDPR does not impose any formalism and that the documentation of a security incident does not have to be included in a data breach register. It considers that the documentation provided following the audit complies with the requirements of the aforementioned article and that it is not required to specify ""the result of the measures taken"", i.e., as requested by the rapporteur, ""the number of Freeboxes recovered by Free after the incident and the date of their recovery"". 75. The restricted panel notes that, at the end of the two-day on-site inspection, the company had not documented the data breach constituted by the return to circulation of 4,137 incorrectly repackaged boxes in a data breach register. The documentation subsequently provided in response to the inspection delegation's requests did not make it possible to determine whether all the Freeboxes that had not been repackaged had been repatriated and, if so, on what date. However, the restricted panel noted that the principle of responsibility laid down by the RGPD states that the data controller must sufficiently document its practices to be able to demonstrate its compliance. In this case, the restricted panel considers that the above-mentioned elements - namely whether all the Freebox boxes whose repackaging had not been effective had been repatriated and, if so, on what date - are part of the information that must be communicated in order to know the factual elements that make it possible to assess the effectiveness of the measure taken to deal with the breach. 76. The restricted panel considered that there was a failure to comply with the obligations arising from Article 33 of the RGPD since the documentation drawn up at the end of the two-day on-site inspection and subsequently in response to requests from the CNIL delegation did not make it possible to take note of all the measures taken to remedy the personal data breach and its effects. 77. The Commission notes that, in the context of the present procedure, the company has justified having taken measures to comply with the obligations arising from Article 33 of the GDPR. III. On the corrective measures and their publicity 78. Under the terms of Article 20 III of the amended Act of 6 January 1978 : ""When the controller or its processor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or from this Act, the president of the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés may also, where appropriate after having sent it the warning provided for in I of this article or, where appropriate, in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted formation of the commission with a view to pronouncing, after adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures: (...) 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine that may not exceed 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the total annual worldwide turnover for the previous financial year, whichever is higher. In the cases referred to in Articles 5 and 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, these ceilings shall be increased to EUR 20 million and 4% of the said turnover respectively. In determining the amount of the fine, the restricted formation shall take into account the criteria specified in the same Article 83."" 79. According to Article 83 of the GDPR: ""1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this Article for violations of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive. ""The Commission shall adopt a proposal for a Directive on the imposition of administrative fines in accordance with Article 6(2) of the Treaty, before specifying the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and the amount of that fine. 80. Firstly, on the principle of imposing a fine, the company maintains that such a measure is not necessary and would not be proportionate to the facts of which it is accused. 81. The restricted formation recalls that it must take into account, for the pronouncement of an administrative fine, the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and the categories of personal data concerned by the breach. 82. The panel considers firstly that the company has shown a certain negligence with regard to the fundamental principles of the GDPR, since several breaches have been established, in particular concerning the rights of individuals and security. The panel added that three breaches had given rise to complaints. 83. The restricted panel then notes that the company is a particularly important player in the Internet access provider sector since, in 2021, it had approximately 6.9 million subscribers, which ranked it among the main Internet access providers in France. It therefore has significant resources to deal with personal data protection issues. 84. Accordingly, the Panel considers that an administrative fine should be imposed for the breaches of Articles 12, 15, 17, 32 and 33 of the GDPR. 85. Secondly, with regard to the amount of the fine, the restricted formation recalls that administrative fines must be both dissuasive and proportionate. In the present case, the panel considers that the company failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 12, 15, 17, 32 and 33 of the GDPR, relating in particular to the rights of individuals and to basic measures relating to the security of personal data. The panel added that several breaches had given rise to complaints, although it noted that the number of complaints revealing the existence of breaches appeared to be small - indeed, their number, ten, should be compared with the number of subscribers, which is approximately 6.9 million - so that these breaches cannot be considered to be of a systemic nature. 86. The restricted formation also recalls that the activity of the company and its financial situation must be taken into account for the determination of the penalty and in particular, in the case of an administrative fine, of its amount. It notes in this respect that the company reports a turnover of EUR \[...\] in 2020 for a net result of approximately EUR \[...\]. 87. 87. Consequently, in view of these elements, the restricted formation considers that the imposition of an administrative fine of EUR 300,000 (three hundred thousand) appears justified. 88. Thirdly, an injunction to bring the processing into compliance with the provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE and Articles 7-1, 15, 17, 32 and 33 of the RGPD was proposed by the rapporteur when the report was notified. 89. The company maintains that the actions it has taken with regard to all the breaches identified should lead to the rapporteur's proposal for an injunction not being followed up. 90. As indicated above, the restricted panel notes that the company has taken measures to bring its processing operations into line with the provisions of Articles 17, 32 and 33 of the GDPR. However, the restricted formation considers that the company has not provided, at the date of the closure of the investigation, elements enabling it to attest to the compliance of its processing operations with the provisions of Article 15 of the RGPD, insofar as it intends to provide only information relating to the identity of the ""primary source"" of the collection of the data subject's data (i.e. the first actor in the chain to have collected the data subject's personal data). Consequently, the restricted formation considers that an injunction should be issued on this point. 91. Lastly, with regard to the publication of the decision to impose a penalty, the company maintains that such a measure would be neither necessary nor proportionate in view of the alleged breaches that it refutes and its compliance. 92. The restricted panel considers that the publicity of the sanction is justified in view of the plurality of breaches committed and the need to bring to the attention of individuals, and in particular the customers concerned, the failings related to the processing of personal data implemented by the company. It also considers that this measure will make it possible to inform the persons concerned of the past existence of the breaches sanctioned, particularly insofar as these facts have been the subject of several complaints. FOR THESE REASONS The CNIL's restricted formation, after deliberation, decides to : - to impose an administrative fine on FREE in the amount of 300,000 (three hundred thousand) euros for breaches of Articles 12, 15, 17, 32 and 33 of the GDPR; - pronounce against the company FREE an injunction to provide an exhaustive response to the requests of Messrs \[...\] (complaint no. 19014037), \[...\] (complaint no. 19015831), \[...\] (complaint no. 19016618) and \[...\] (complaint no. 19005208) which specifies the identity of the data broker from which it obtained the data of the persons concerned; - 500 (five hundred) euros per day of delay at the end of a period of one month following notification of this decision, with proof of compliance to be sent to the restricted formation within this period; - make its decision public on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, which will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication.

Facts and procedure 1. LUSHA SYSTEMS INC (hereinafter ""the Company"") was established in April 2016 and has its registered office at 800 Boylston Street, Suite 1410 in Boston (United States), and is a wholly owned subsidiary of YT DEV LTD, located in Israel. It does not have an establishment in the European Union. In 2021, the company had a turnover of \[...\] dollars. 2. The company markets an extension (hereinafter ""the Lusha extension""), available from the ""lusha.co"" website, running on the Chrome and Chromium browsers and allowing its users to obtain the professional contact details (telephone number and email address) of people whose profiles they visit on the LinkedIn social network or on the Salesforce.com customer relations platform (hereinafter ""Salesforce""). 3. The company also publishes, through its wholly owned companies SIMPLER APPS INC, LOBSTER APPS INC and TOP FLOOR INC, the applications for mobile phones called ""Simpler"", ""Mailbook"" and ""Cleaner Pro"", which were available in France on Android and iOS systems until August 2022 and which presented themselves as offering a ""contact management"" service to the user 4. On 24 January and 1 February 2018, following an alert received in January 2018, a CNIL delegation carried out an online check on the ""lusha.co"" website pursuant to Decision No. 2018-020C of 24 January 2018 of the President of the French National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties (hereinafter ""CNIL"" or ""the Commission""). 5. The purpose of this mission was to verify the company's compliance with the provisions of Law No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978, as amended, relating to information technology, files and freedoms (hereinafter ""the Data Protection Act"" or ""the Act of 6 January 1978""), in connection with processing relating to the ""lusha.co"" domain and/or the extension for Chrome and Chromium browsers known as ""Lusha"". 6. On 6 March 2019, the supervisory delegation carried out a new online check to verify the compliance of the processing operations relating to the ""lusha.co"" domain and the Lusha extension, in particular for the purpose of verifying the investigation of two complaints received by the CNIL services on 22 October 2018 and 14 February 2019 respectively. 7. Representatives of the company were interviewed at the Commission's premises on 18 July 2019. 8. On 19 and 20 December 2019, pursuant to Decisions No. 2019-228C, 2019-231C and 2019-232C of 17 December 2019 of the President of the CNIL, the Commission's services carried out three online checks on the ""Simpler"", ""Mailbook"" and ""Cleaner Pro"" applications from a mobile terminal. 9. The purpose of these checks was to verify the compliance of the processing operations accessible from these mobile applications, or relating to personal data collected from them from any organisation concerned by their implementation, with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of personal data (hereinafter ""the GDPR"" or ""the Regulation"") and the Data Protection Act. 10. By emails sent between July 2019 and May 2020, the company sent the CNIL several documents and elements of response requested by the Commission's services in the context of the investigations. 11. On 29 March 2021, on the basis of Article 22 of the Act of 6 January 1978, the President of the Commission appointed Mr François PELLEGRINI as rapporteur for the purpose of investigating these elements. 12. On 15 June 2022, at the end of his investigation, the rapporteur notified the company of a report detailing the breaches of the RGPD that he considered to have occurred in this case. The letter notifying the company of the report indicated that it had a period of one month to submit its written observations under the provisions of Article 40 of Decree no. 2019-536 of 29 May 2019, as amended, taken for the application of the Data Protection Act (hereinafter ""the Decree of 29 May 2019""). 13. This report proposed that the restricted panel impose an administrative fine on the company, as well as an injunction to bring the processing into compliance with Articles 6 and 15 of the RGPD on a principal basis and Articles 14 to 15 on a subsidiary basis, together with a penalty payment at the end of a period of three months following notification of the decision. It also proposed that the decision be made public and that the company no longer be identified by name after a period of two years from its publication. 14. By letter dated 22 June 2022, the company requested additional time from the chairman of the restricted panel to produce its observations in response to the rapporteur's report, which was granted on 24 June, on the basis of Article 40(4) of the Decree of 29 May 2019. 15. On 30 August 2022, the company submitted its observations in response. 16. On 30 September 2022, the rapporteur replied to the company's comments. 17. On 7 November 2022, the company submitted new observations in response to the rapporteur's comments. 18. By letter dated 8 November 2022, the rapporteur informed the company's counsel that the investigation was closed, pursuant to Article 40, III, of amended Decree no. 2019-536 of 29 May 2019. 19. By letter of the same date, the company was informed that the case had been placed on the agenda of the restricted formation of 24 November 2022. 20. The rapporteur and the company presented oral observations at the meeting of the restricted formation. II. Reasons for the decision A. On the processing operation at issue and the status of Lusha with regard to this processing operation 1. On the personal data processing at issue: the Lusha extension 21. According to Article 4(2) of the GDPR, processing of personal data is ""any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data or sets of personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction"". 22. In the present case, the restricted formation notes that once installed on a Chrome or Chromium browser and after creating a ""Lusha"" account, the extension marketed by the company allows a user browsing the LinkedIn social network or the Salesforce.com platform to obtain information on a person whose profile is visited by the user (hereinafter ""the target person""), namely the professional contact details of this person (telephone number(s) and/or e-mail address(es)), which will be displayed in a floating window on the visited page. 23. When the user visits the target person's LinkedIn profile or Salesforce page, the extension will compare the target person's name with any identical names stored in the company's database. In the event that at least one result is returned, the extension will verify that the company listed as the target person's employer on the visited LinkedIn or Salesforce profile matches the one in its database. If the above criteria return a result and the phone number and/or email address associated with the target person appear in the digital address books of at least two distinct people registered in the company's database, the associated number and/or email address will be displayed in the floating window of the user visiting the target person's page. 24. The company representatives clarified at the hearing on 18 July 2019 that the extension works in a free version, with a credit of five contacts, and in a paid version, with a number of contacts depending on the amount of credits subscribed. 25. Between 2016 and August 2022, the data constituting the company's contact database was collected through the three mobile contact management applications ""Simpler"", ""Mailbook"" and ""Cleaner Pro"", developed by subsidiaries of the company, which sucked up the digital address books of their users and transferred them to Lusha. 26. More specifically, when the applications were first opened, a pop-up window appeared informing users that by creating their account they were about to share their contacts with the ""community of applications to assist in identity verification"". The company then filtered the transmitted data to keep only ""professional"" contact data (phone number(s) and/or email address(es)), excluding contact data for personal use. To carry out this filtering, the company used publicly available information to understand the structure of a company's e-mail address and/or telephone number (e.g.: prenom.nom@societe.com and for a French company based in Paris: + 33 1) and, on the other hand, a white list of professional contact names drawn up by the CRUNCHBASE company comprising, at the time of the checks, the contacts of 5 to 7 million companies. Only the contacts on this white list were included in the Lusha database. 27. Since the above-mentioned applications were withdrawn from the French market in August 2022, the operation of the extension previously involved three distinct categories of people: - First, the users of the mobile applications, i.e. the people whose address books containing the contact data of the persons concerned were sucked in by the mobile applications and then transmitted into the Lusha database; - secondly, the data subjects, also known as target persons, i.e. the persons whose contact data are present in the Lusha database and who are subject to the processing at stake; - finally, the users of the Lusha extension, i.e. the company's customers, using the extension in a free or paid version, who visit the LinkedIn or Salesforce profiles of the target persons in order, in particular, to obtain their professional contact details in order to approach them. 28. Thus, the data subjects (in the sense in which this term will be used below), whose data are consulted by Lusha's customers, are neither users of the Lusha extension, nor users of the applications developed by the company's subsidiaries, their presence in the Lusha database being explained solely by the fact that their contact details appeared in the address book of one or more of their contacts (friend, family, colleague, etc.) who had downloaded the ""Simpler"", ""Mailbook"" or ""Cleaner Pro"" applications. 29. The restricted formation notes that the fact that the database in question used for the operation of the Lusha extension is, in principle, only made up of the ""professional"" contact details of individuals remains without bearing on the ""personal"" nature of those data, according to the well-established case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (see, in particular, CJEU, 9 November 2010, Volker and Others, Case C-92/09 and C-93/09, pt. 59). 30. It notes, moreover, that it is clear from the foregoing that the operations of collecting the address books of the users of the mobile applications and then filtering that data necessarily lead the company also to process the so-called 'personal' details of the contacts appearing in the collected address books (personal details and other data such as contact notes), even though those data are not subsequently entered in the database used for the operation of the Lusha extension. 31. The company states that the purpose of the extension is to combat online fraud by allowing its users to ensure that the target person whose profile they are visiting ""is the person they claim to be or works for the company they claim to belong to"" (hearing 18 July 2019). 32. The Panel also notes that it was noted on the company's website during the online inspection on 6 March 2019 that the company presents its service as allowing its users to ""meet the challenge of enabling real contact with your customers, by knowing \[their\] correct phone numbers, email address and company details. Access the data you need to contact your prospects via social networks, the web, Saleforces or the API"" and quotes one of its users as saying that it is ""the best app for finding phone numbers and information about individuals, fast and easy to use"". 33. It follows from the above that all the different processing operations mentioned above, all of which are essential for the functioning of the Lusha extension, and which consist, in particular, in collecting, storing, structuring, combining and disseminating personal data, in particular the ""raw"" contact data of users of the ""Simpler"", ""Mailbook"" and ""Cleaner Pro"" applications and data from the CRUNCHBASE white list, are part of one and the same processing of personal data for the purposes of combating online fraud and providing contact details of prospective customers (hereinafter ""the processing in question""). 2. On the status of the company Lusha 34. Under Article 4(7) of the GDPR, a controller is ""the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing"". 35. 35. In this case, the company declared to the CNIL that it was ""responsible for the processing operations resulting from the use of \[the Lusha extension\]"" and that SIMPLER APPS INC, LOBSTER APPS INC and TOP FLOOR INC were responsible for the processing of the mobile applications that they develop (i.e. the ""Simpler"", ""Mailbook"" and ""Cleaner Pro"" applications) 36. Regardless of this division, the Panel considers that the company should be considered responsible for all processing operations necessary for the functioning of its extension. 37. 37. Thus, the company's liability also extends to the collection of contact data of persons appearing in the address books of users of mobile applications and the transmission of these data to the Lusha database, since these two operations were, at the time of the checks, essential to the supply of the contact database without which the Lusha extension could not function. 38. If, in fact, these two processing operations were carried out within the mobile applications developed by the company's subsidiaries, the restricted formation emphasises that the company was necessarily at the origin of them via the decision-making power it exercises over these three companies, which it wholly owns and which have no employees. Consequently, and without the need to determine whether the subsidiaries are solely responsible for processing the data collection operation, while Lusha is solely responsible for the data transmission operation to its database, or whether they are jointly responsible for processing with Lusha for both operations, or whether they are subcontractors of Lusha for both operations, the restricted formation considers that the parent company determines, at least in part, the purposes and means of these processing operations and is therefore responsible for processing. 39. It follows from the above that the company is responsible for the processing at issue. B. On the applicability of the GDPR 40. 40. The rapporteur maintains that the CNIL was competent under the Data Protection Act, and then under the GDPR, to initiate a control procedure and then a sanction procedure against the company. More specifically, he considers that the RGPD is applicable to the processing at issue under Article 3(2)(b), since the processing concerns personal data relating to data subjects in the territory of the European Union and is linked to the monitoring of the behaviour of those data subjects. 41. The company considers that the CNIL has no jurisdiction since the initiation of the monitoring procedure. In particular, it considers that the GDPR is not applicable to it insofar as it does not process personal data linked to the ""behaviour"" of the data subjects and does not implement ""monitoring"" or ""profiling"" activities, and attaches to this support the conclusions of an expert report commissioned on its initiative. It added that the inapplicability of the GDPR to its activities had been confirmed by the National Commission for Data Protection, the Luxembourg data protection authority (hereinafter ""the CNPD""), which had issued a statement on the subject in an e-mail dated 9 June 2022. 42. Article 3 of the GDPR, relating to the territorial scope, provides that the GDPR applies to: ""1. \[...\] the processing of personal data carried out in the course of the activities of an establishment of a controller or processor on the territory of the Union, whether or not the processing takes place within the Union. (2) \[...\] the processing of personal data relating to data subjects within the Union by a controller or processor who is not established in the Union, where the processing activities relate to: (a) the supply of goods or services to those data subjects within the Union, whether or not payment is required from them; or (b) the monitoring of the conduct of those data subjects, insofar as that conduct takes place within the Union. 43. According to Article 4(4) of the GDPR, profiling is defined as ""any form of automated processing of personal data which consists in using such personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict factors concerning that natural person's work performance, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, conduct, location or movements"". 44. Recital 24 of the GDPR states in this respect that ""The processing of personal data of data subjects within the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation where such processing relates to the monitoring of the behaviour of those individuals insofar as it concerns their behaviour within the Union. In order to determine whether a processing activity can be considered as monitoring the behaviour of data subjects, it should be established whether individuals are being monitored on the Internet, including the possible further use of personal data processing techniques consisting of profiling of an individual, in particular for the purpose of making decisions about him or her or analysing or predicting his or her preferences, behaviour and state of mind. 45. By way of illustration, in its Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR in their version of 12 November 2019, the European Data Protection Committee (hereinafter ""EDPS"") notes that, ""contrary to the provision of Article 3(2)(a), neither Article 3(2)(b) nor Recital 24 expressly introduces a necessary degree of 'intent to target' on the part of the controller or processor to determine whether the monitoring activity would trigger the application of the GDPR to the processing activities. However, the use of the word 'monitoring' implies that the controller has a specific purpose for the collection and subsequent re-use of relevant data relating to the behaviour of an individual within the Union. The Committee does not consider that the online collection or analysis of personal data of individuals in the Union would automatically be considered as 'monitoring'. It will be necessary to take into account the purpose for which the data is processed by the controller and, in particular, any subsequent behavioural analysis or profiling techniques involving such data. The Committee takes into account the wording of Recital 24, which states that in determining whether the processing involves the monitoring of a data subject's behaviour, the monitoring of individuals on the Internet, including the potential further use of profiling techniques, is an important factor. 46. In the present case, since the company has no establishment in the European Union and the Lusha extension is not linked to an offer of goods or services to ""data subjects"" as defined in § 28 of this decision, the restricted formation notes that neither the criterion of establishment provided for in paragraph 1 of Article 3 of the RGPD, nor the criterion relating to the offer of services to data subjects in the Union provided for in paragraph 2, a) of the same article are applicable. 47. As regards the criterion relating to the monitoring of the behaviour of data subjects, provided for in paragraph 2(b) of the same Article 3, the applicability of which is invoked by the rapporteur, the restricted formation notes that although the company does indeed process the personal data of persons located in the European Union and, in particular, in France, it is not established that these persons are subject to monitoring of their behaviour by the company. Indeed, the restricted panel noted that the company's creation of the database was based solely on the reconciliation of professional contact data (telephone, e-mail address) with the identity of persons whose profiles were visited on LinkedIn in order to verify their veracity. It is therefore not, in this case, processing that consists of analysing or predicting a person's behaviour, personal preferences or movements, interests, economic situation or state of health. The panel considered that the company did not use personal data processing techniques that consisted in profiling a natural person. 48. It follows from the above that the GDPR is not applicable to the processing at issue. Consequently, it is not within the powers of the restricted panel to impose a penalty. 49. It seems appropriate that all users of the applications in question should be informed that the processing operations implemented by the company Lusha are not subject to the GDPR. It is therefore appropriate to order the publication of this decision. FOR THESE REASONS The CNIL's restricted formation, after having deliberated, decides : - that there are no grounds for imposing a penalty; - to make its decision public on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, which will no longer allow the company to be identified by name after a period of two years from its publication. The Chairman Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be appealed to the Council of State within four months of its notification."

Facts and procedure 1. The APPLE Group (APPLE INC. and its subsidiaries, collectively the ""APPLE Group"") designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communications and media devices, personal computers, and sells a range of software, services and peripherals, networking solutions, digital content, and third-party applications in connection with these products. 2. The APPLE Group's products, which include the iPhone (a multi-functional mobile phone), each come with a specific pre-installed operating system designed within the APPLE Group (iOS for the iPhone). 3. The APPLE Group sells and delivers its digital content and applications through its online application shops, which are the App Store, the iTunes Store, the iBooks Store and the Mac App Store. 4. APPLE INC. generally holds, directly or indirectly through intermediary entities, interests in all subsidiaries of the group. These include APPLE DISTRIBUTION INTERNATIONAL LTD (hereinafter ""ADI""), APPLE FRANCE, APPLE RETAIL FRANCE and APPLE EUROPE INC (hereinafter ""AEI""). 5. ADI is located at Hollyhill Industrial Estate, Cork, Ireland and employs approximately \[...\] employees. It describes itself as the entity responsible for the sales and distribution of APPLE Group products in Europe. It also considers itself to be the controller of personal data relating to the activity of the APPLE group's advertising platforms in the European Economic Area. 6. For the year 2021, ADI has a turnover of approximately USD \[...\], which is approximately EUR \[...\] (at the current exchange rate). 7. APPLE FRANCE is located at 7, place d'Iéna in Paris (75116) and has approximately \[...\] employees. It does not sell or distribute products in France. Its role is to support the sales and marketing of products marketed by ADI to distribution partners in the French market, under a ""sales and marketing support service contract"" in force since 1 October 2018. 8. APPLE RETAIL FRANCE is located at 3-5, rue Saint-Georges in Paris (75009). Its role is to sell and distribute APPLE group products in France. 9. AEI, which has its registered office in the State of Delaware, United States of America, has a branch in France with the same name (AEI), whose registered office is located at 7 place d'Iéna in Paris (75116). 10. AEI, which is based in the State of Delaware, United States of America, has a branch in France with the same name (AEI), whose registered office is located at 7 place d'Iéna in Paris (75116). 11. On 10 March 2021, the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (hereinafter ""the CNIL"" or ""the Commission"") received a complaint against APPLE from the association FRANCE DIGITALE. The complaint concerns the processing carried out by the APPLE group through its iOS and MacOs operating systems. The complaint states that the privacy setting ""Personalised ads"" in the settings of devices marketed by the APPLE group and running on the iOS and Mac OS operating systems is activated by default, which does not allow users to validly consent to advertising targeting. 12. Two online monitoring missions on devices running the iOS and MacOS operating systems were conducted on 8 and 16 June 2021. 13. Official reports No 2021-113/1 and No 2021-113/2, drawn up by the delegation on the day of the checks, were notified to ADI and AEI on 24 June 2021. On this occasion, requests for additional information were sent to them. ADI replied by emails dated 5 and 12 July 2021. On the other hand, in emails dated 30 June and 8 July 2021, AEI stated that it was not in a position to respond to the delegation's requests, as it did not play a ""decisive role in the processing operations subject to the audit"". 14. A documentary inspection was also carried out at ADI, AEI and APPLE FRANCE on 13 July 2021. These companies sent their response to the CNIL by e-mail on 25 August 2021. In emails dated 31 August 2021, APPLE FRANCE and AEI completed these responses by sending, each for what it is concerned, the register of processing operations implemented. On this occasion, a request for additional information was sent to ADI, which replied by e-mail dated 5 October 2021. 15. Finally, an on-site inspection at the premises of APPLE FRANCE was carried out on 13 October 2021 in order to obtain further information on its relations with ADI, on the activity of employees holding the position of ""Search Ads Platform Specialists"" or ""Search Ads Platform Specialists Managers"" and on the operation of the ""Apple Search Ads"" service. 16. 16. Report No. 2021-113/3, drawn up by the delegation on the day of the inspection, was notified to APPLE FRANCE and ADI on 19 October and 14 December 2021 respectively. On this occasion, a request for further information was sent to APPLE FRANCE, which replied by e-mail on 25 October 2021. 17. 17. A request for further information was sent to ADI by letter dated 15 November 2021, to which it replied by e-mail dated 17 November and 3 December 2021. 18. By e-mail dated December 7, 2021, the CNIL sent a new request for additional information to ADI, which responded by e-mail dated December 22, 2021. 19. For the purposes of investigating these elements, the Commission's President appointed Mr François PELLEGRINI as rapporteur on 10 January 2022, on the basis of Article 22 of the amended Act of 6 January 1978. 20. In an email dated 18 February 2022, ADI requested a hearing in order to explain to the rapporteur the context of the complaint lodged by the association FRANCE DIGITALE and to provide information about the framework in which technical operations are carried out on mobile terminals running the iOS operating system. 21. 21. The rapporteur having responded favourably to this request, the company's hearing took place on 16 March 2022 at the CNIL premises. 22. 22. Minute No. CTX-2021-106 drawn up at the end of the hearing was notified to ADI by e-mail on 17 March 2022. The communication of additional documents was again requested by the CNIL. 23. On 30 March, 12 April and 3 June 2022, ADI sent the requested documents to the CNIL. 24. On 27 July 2022, the rapporteur notified the company of a report proposing that the restricted panel impose an administrative fine of six million euros for failure to comply with Article 82 of Law no. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 on information technology, files and freedoms (hereinafter ""the Information Technology and Freedoms Law""), which he considered to have been committed in this case. It also proposed that this decision be made public, but that it should no longer be possible to identify the company by name after two years from its publication. 25. 25. On 29 July 2022, the company requested an additional period to submit its comments in response. 26. On 4 August 2022, the chairman of the restricted panel rejected this request. 27. On 19 September 2022, the company submitted its observations in response to the sanction report. 28. On 19 October 2022, the rapporteur sent his reply to the company's observations. 29. On 24 October 2022, the company requested an additional period to submit its second observations in response. 30. On 26 October 2022, the chairman of the restricted panel rejected this request. 31. On 21 November 2022, the company submitted new observations in response to those of the rapporteur. 32. On 22 November 2022, the rapporteur informed the company and the chairman of the restricted formation of the closure of the investigation. On the same day, the chairman of the restricted panel sent a notice to attend the meeting of the restricted panel on 8 December 2022. 33. On 23 November 2022, the company requested a postponement of the panel meeting. 34. On 24 November 2022, the chairman of the restricted panel granted this request and set the date of the meeting for 12 December 2022. 35. The rapporteur and ADI presented oral observations at the meeting of the restricted panel. II. Reasons for the decision A. On the competence of the CNIL 1. On the material competence of the CNIL and the applicability of the ""one-stop shop"" mechanism provided for by the RGPD 36. Under the terms of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, which constitutes the transposition into domestic law of Article 5(3) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector, ""any subscriber to or user of an electronic communications service must be informed in a clear and comprehensive manner, unless he or she has been informed in advance, by the controller or his or her representative of 1° Of the purpose of any action intended to access, by electronic transmission, information already stored in his electronic communications terminal equipment, or to write information in this equipment; 2° Of the means available to him to oppose it. Such access or recording may only take place on condition that the subscriber or user has expressed, after having received this information, his consent, which may result from the appropriate parameters of his connection device or any other device under his control. \[...\] "". 37. The rapporteur considers that the CNIL is materially competent to monitor and initiate a sanction procedure concerning the writing and/or reading of information implemented by ADI, i.e. on users' terminal equipment and which fall within the scope of the ePrivacy Directive. 38. It notes that the information provided by the company shows that this processing is part of the service implemented by ADI, called ""Search Ads"", for the purpose of personalising ads on the App Store. This allows developers to promote their application to users on the App Store based solely on the following criteria: ""device type"" (iPad, iPhone or both), ""customer type"" (new, old or all existing users), ""demographic profile"" (gender and age range), ""location"" (city, region or country) and ""campaign planning"" (start and end date of an advertising campaign). 39. If the setting for receiving targeted advertising in the App Store is enabled in the iPhone settings, the user will see applications promoted through the ""Search Ads"" service at the top of the search results. Conversely, if this setting is not activated, users will still receive an ad, which will not be personalised but contextual, depending on the search performed. 40. 40. To achieve this, the rapporteur notes that the company has set up a ""technical architecture"" that operates in several stages. 41. The first stage relates to data collection: when the Apple user account (commonly referred to as the ""Apple Id"") is created, a technical identifier called the ""directory services identifier"" (hereinafter ""DSID"") is assigned to each user account. The DSID is created on the company's servers. It is used, among other things, to access iCloud and the content, information and services associated with the Apple user account. 42. When browsing the App Store, the user's activity log (i.e., the fact that the user searches, downloads or purchases applications from the App Store), as well as the information that the user has entered in his or her Apple ID account (i.e., the user's year of birth, gender and location), is collected and associated with this DSID on Apple's ""Apple Media Platforms"" (hereinafter ""AMP"") servers. 43. If the setting for receiving targeted advertising in the App Store is enabled, this data is used to determine the segments to which a user will be assigned and, therefore, the advertisements that the user will receive. A ""segment"" is a group of at least 5,000 users who share similar characteristics and who have the setting for receiving targeted advertising in the App Store enabled in the iPhone settings. 44. The second step relates to the creation of identifiers specific to the personalisation of ads aimed at promoting mobile applications on the App Store: in order to avoid the distribution and measurement of advertising content involving the use of the DSID, the user's device will generate locally on the user's terminal two other identifiers: - on the one hand, the ""device pack identifier"" (hereinafter the ""DPID"") which is synchronised via iCloud in order to ensure that all devices of the same user have the same DPID; - on the other hand, the iADID, which is specific to each device and does not require synchronisation via iCloud. 45. Finally, the third step relates to the display of personalised ads on the user's device: when the user searches for an application in the App Store, his device sends an ad request to the Ad Platforms servers containing the word searched for, the DPID, the iADID and the identifiers relating to the segments concerning him, so that they can determine the targeted advertisement to be displayed first (all these elements being available locally on the terminal, the process avoids the possibility that the Ad Platforms servers can identify the Apple account associated with each request) The iADID can also be used to count the number of ""ad impressions"" made on a device, i.e. the number of times a given ad is displayed. 46. In view of these elements, the rapporteur maintains, on the one hand, that the company carries out read and/or write operations on users' terminals in order to authenticate the DSID of a user account registered as active on Apple's servers for the purpose of personalising advertisements intended to promote mobile applications on the App Store and, on the other hand, that the company performs a read operation of the DPID and the iAdId (as well as the list of segments associated with the person previously written in the terminal by the AMP servers) in the users' terminals during the requests sent to the Ad Platforms servers. 47. 47. In its defence, the company maintains that the processing for the purposes of personalising ads on the App Store that it implements is carried out either on its servers and does not fall within the scope of the CNIL's investigations, or on users' terminals solely for the purposes of ""secure user authentication"" or ""protection of privacy"" and therefore constitute operations falling within the exemptions from the collection of consent provided for in Article 82 of the Data Protection Act. 48. To examine the question of the material existence of read or write operations, the restricted formation considers that a distinction must be made between the DSID and the DPID/iAdId. a. On read and/or write operations related to the DSID 49. In its defence, the company first acknowledges that ""information is stored on a single Apple device to securely authenticate its user in connection with an Apple account DSID on Apple's servers"" but states that this ""information is not \[...\] used for advertising purposes"". The company goes on to say that ""searches performed in the App Store by users are necessarily followed by operations that allow Apple to return the search results to the device used. However, the operations in this context are not performed to create segments for advertising purposes, but simply to provide the service requested, i.e. the App Store. Finally, the company states that ""all information used by Apple to create the segments described in comment #1 for the purpose of personalising ads is stored and maintained on Apple's servers"". 50. The Panel first notes that it is clear from these elements that the company does not deny that it writes information on users' terminals in order to authenticate the DSID of a user account registered as active on Apple's servers. 51. Next, the Panel notes that although the company maintains that no information is stored and/or read on users' terminals in order to assign segments to them, it is nonetheless able to identify all requests relating to searches in the App Store to Apple's servers as coming from a single terminal associated with a specific account. 52. The Panel also notes in this regard that, when asked about this mechanism at the hearing on 16 March 2022, the company stated that ""When the user searches the App Store and downloads applications or performs transactions through this platform, his activity is recorded by the server of the said platform and is associated with his 'directory services ID' (DSID), which is the technical identifier relating to the APPLE user account of the user (a DSID corresponds to an APPLE ID). Moreover, during the hearing, the DSID was presented as ""essential to securely authenticate an Apple terminal and account"". The restricted formation also notes that the rapporteur described the processing at issue, indicating in particular that ""the DSID is the technical identifier relating to the user account of each user and allows the connection to be maintained when the user browses the various Apple services"" and that this point was not contested by the company. It is clear from these elements that ""information"", which is then attached to the DSID, is read from the user's terminal in order to associate his downloads and the results of his searches with his Apple account. 53. Accordingly, the Panel considers that the company is reading and/or writing information on users' terminals to authenticate the DSID of a user account registered as active on Apple's servers. b. On the operations of reading the DPID and the iAdId on the user's terminal 54. In its defence, the company acknowledges that ""technical measures, such as 'storage' and 'access' operations on the terminal \[...\] are intended to replace the DSID with the DPID, in order to avoid linking the user's identity (the DSID) to the relevant segments applicable to that user"", in accordance with the obligation of data protection by design provided for in Article 25 of the RGPD. With regard to the DPID, however, it specifies that this replacement operation is only taking place to protect ""the privacy of its users"". With regard to the iAdId identifier, it states that it ""does not allow any tracking and is only used as a privacy-enhancing identifier in the context of statistical measurements"". 55. The restricted formation recalls again that the only action aiming at accessing information already stored in a user's terminal equipment located in France entails the application of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act. 56. The restricted formation therefore considers that if the replacement of information attached to the DSID by third party identifiers (DPID and iAdId, which are generated directly by the user's telephone) has the advantage of avoiding the distribution of the DSID to APPLE's ""Ad Platforms"" dedicated to advertising (and therefore of breaking the link between the identifier and the identity of the person concerned), The fact remains that these two new identifiers (as well as the list of segments associated with the person previously written in the terminal by the AMP servers) are subsequently read in the user's terminal when requests are made to the Ad Platforms servers. They are in fact used during the stages relating to the selection and distribution of advertisements intended to promote targeted applications on the App Store, as well as for counting the number of times an advertisement is displayed on a device (measurement of ""advertising impressions""), which therefore implies access to information already stored in the user's terminal equipment. 57. Consequently, the restricted formation considers that the company proceeds to a reading operation of the DPID and the iAdId (as well as the list of segments associated with the person previously written in the terminal by the AMP servers) in the user's terminal during the requests sent to the ""Ad Platforms"" servers. c. On subsequent processing and the applicability of the ""one-stop shop"" mechanism provided for by the RGPD 58. In its defence, the company argues that the writing and/or reading of identifiers that take place on the user's terminal equipment when using the App Store and the subsequent use of the data collected by these identifiers for the purposes pursued by the controller are indissociable. Thus, the company considers that ""the rapporteur does not respond to the analysis \[...\] according to which the CNIL would not be competent under the GDPR"". It states that the operations aimed at assigning segments to a given user take place on the APPLE group's AMP servers and not on the user's terminal, ""provided that an Apple device has authenticated itself to the server"". It deduced that ""this processing can therefore only be ""further processing"" carried out after any ""reading"" or ""storing"" operation carried out for authentication"". Consequently, the company considers that, insofar as the CNIL has initiated a sanction procedure against it concerning only the operations of writing and/or reading identifiers that take place on the user's terminal equipment when they use the App Store, it is not justified in mobilising, in its demonstration, elements related to the processing subsequent to these operations, in this case the activities carried out subsequently on Apple's servers which do not ""consist of storing or accessing information on the user's device. It considers that these processing operations do not fall under Article 82 of the Data Protection Act but under the RGPD and that, insofar as its principal place of business is located in Ireland, the competence to initiate such a procedure would lie with the Irish data protection authority, the lead authority under Article 56 of the RGPD, which is competent to implement the cooperation mechanism between supervisory authorities, known as the ""one-stop shop"" mechanism, provided for in Chapter VII of the Regulation. 59. The restricted formation recalls, first of all, that a distinction must be made between, on the one hand, reading and writing operations on a terminal, which are governed by the provisions of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act and for which the French legislator has entrusted the CNIL with a supervisory role and, in particular, with the power to sanction any infringement of this article, and, on the other hand, the use of a terminal for the purposes of data protection, on the other hand, the subsequent use of the data produced or collected through these operations, which is governed by the RGPD and may therefore, if necessary, be subject to the ""one-stop shop"" mechanism. 60. It then recalls that the Conseil d'Etat, in its decision Société GOOGLE LLC and Société GOOGLE IRELAND LIMITED of 28 January 2022, confirmed that the control of operations of access or registration of information in the terminals of users in France of an electronic communications service, even when proceeding from cross-border processing, falls within the competence of the CNIL and that the one-stop-shop system provided for by the RGPD is not applicable: ""no provision has been made for the application of the so-called ""one-stop shop"" mechanism applicable to cross-border processing, as defined in Article 56 of this Regulation, for the implementation and control measures of Directive 2002/58/EC of 12 July 2002, which fall within the competence of the national supervisory authorities by virtue of Article 15a of that Directive. It follows that, as far as the control of operations of access and recording of information in the terminals of users in France of an electronic communications service is concerned, even if they are the result of cross-border processing, the measures for controlling the application of the provisions transposing the objectives of Directive 2002/58/EC fall within the competence conferred on the CNIL by the law of 6 January 1978 \[...(CE, 10th and 9th joint chambers, 28 January 2022, GOOGLE LLC and GOOGLE IRELAND LIMITED, n° 449209, pt. 12). The Council of State reaffirmed this position in a ruling of 27 June 2022 (CE, 10th and 9th joint chambers, 27 June 2022, AMAZON EUROPE CORE, No. 451423). 61. Finally, the restricted formation notes that although the rapporteur's writings contain references to the consequences of writing and/or reading information on users' terminals in order to authenticate the information attached to the DSID of a user account as well as that of the DPID and the iAdId for Internet users, they do not contain any analysis of the compliance with the RGPD of the subsequent processing of personal data carried out on the basis of the data collected by means of these trackers. Only the reading and/or writing operations of the DPID, DSID and iAdId identifiers and their purposes will be analysed to determine whether Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act is applicable. 62. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that the CNIL is competent to monitor and initiate a sanction procedure concerning the processing operations implemented by the company falling within the scope of the ePrivacy Directive, provided that the processing operation falls within its territorial jurisdiction. 2. On the territorial jurisdiction of the CNIL 63. Under the terms of paragraph I of Article 3 of the Data Protection Act, which sets out the rule for the territorial application of the requirements set out in Article 82 of the Data Protection Act: ""Without prejudice, as regards processing falling within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, to the criteria provided for in Article 3 of that Regulation, all the provisions of this Act shall apply to the processing of personal data carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or processor on French territory, whether or not the processing takes place in France. "" 64. The rapporteur considers that the CNIL is territorially competent in application of these provisions since the processing subject of the present procedure, consisting of operations of reading and/or writing information in the mobile terminals of users residing in France when using the App Store, is carried out in the ""framework of the activities"" of the companies APPLE RETAIL FRANCE and APPLE FRANCE, which constitute the ""establishment"" of ADI on French territory, which are involved in the promotion and marketing of ADI's products and their advertising solutions in France. 65. 65. In its defence, the company contests the territorial jurisdiction of the CNIL insofar as there is no ""indissociable link"" between the activities of APPLE RETAIL FRANCE and the processing at issue. The company considers in this sense that ""the simple sale of computer hardware does not create \[...\] a link with the processing operations carried out by the software present on this hardware"". It therefore considers that the second criterion for territorial application of the Data Protection Act, provided for in Article 3(1), is not met, namely that the processing in question is carried out ""in the context of the activities of this establishment"". Similarly, with regard to APPLE FRANCE, ADI also considers that the territorial jurisdiction of the CNIL is not established. It maintains that there cannot be an ""indissociable link"" between the activities of APPLE FRANCE and the processing at issue insofar as ""the hiring of the 'Search Ads Specialists' in France"" has not resulted in a significant difference in income and that they do not carry out an ""activity of promotion and marketing of advertising tools"". 66. The restricted formation recalls that under Article 3 of the Data Protection Act, the CNIL is competent to exercise its powers when the two criteria provided for in this article are met, in this case, the existence of an establishment of the data controller on French territory and the existence of processing carried out in the context of the activities of this establishment. 67. As regards, firstly, the existence of an establishment of the controller on French territory, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) stated in its Weltimmo judgment of 1 October 2015 that ""the concept of 'establishment', within the meaning of Directive 95/46, extends to any real and effective activity, however minimal, carried out by means of a fixed establishment"", the criterion of stability of the establishment being examined in the light of the presence of ""human and technical resources necessary for the provision of the specific services in question"". The CJEU considers that a company, an autonomous legal person, of the same group as the controller, may constitute an establishment of the controller within the meaning of these provisions (CJEU, 13 May 2014, Google Spain, C-131/12, pt 48). 68. In the present case, the panel notes that APPLE RETAIL FRANCE and APPLE FRANCE are both subsidiaries of APPLE INC and have permanent premises located in France. It also notes that APPLE FRANCE employs approximately \[...\] people. Consequently, APPLE RETAIL FRANCE and APPLE FRANCE each constitute an establishment of ADI within the meaning of Article 3 of the Data Protection Act. 69. Secondly, with regard to the existence of processing carried out in the context of the activities of that establishment, the restricted formation recalls that it is not necessary for the processing at issue to be carried out ""by that establishment"" (CJEU, 13 May 2014, Google Spain, C-131/12, pt. 57), i.e. by the companies APPLE RETAIL FRANCE or APPLE FRANCE, as data controllers, and that it is sufficient that one and/or the other of these establishments facilitates or promotes sufficiently the deployment in the French territory of the processing of personal data implemented by the data controller established in another Member State (the company ADI) for there to be an obligation to comply with the law territorially applicable in France and to base the competence of the national supervisory authority. 70. In this sense, the restricted panel notes that, in its decision AMAZON EUROPE CORE of 27 June 2022, the Conseil d'État recalled that ""it follows from the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, in particular from its judgment of 5 June 2018, Unabhängiges Landeszentrum für Datenschutz Schleswig-Holstein v Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein GmbH (C-210/16), in the light of the objective pursued by that directive \[the e-Privacy Directive\] of ensuring effective and comprehensive protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the protection of privacy and the protection of personal data processing of personal data may be regarded as being carried out ""in the course of the activities"" of a national establishment not only if that establishment is itself involved in carrying out that processing, but also if the latter merely carries out, on the territory of a Member State the promotion and sale of advertising space in order to make profitable the services offered by the controller of a processing operation consisting in collecting personal data by means of connection tracers installed on the terminals of visitors to a site"" (EC, 10th and 9th chambers, 27 June 2022, AMAZON EUROPE CORE, No. 451423, pt. 10). The Council of State considered in the same decision that this was the case when the activities of the controller's establishment consisted of the promotion and marketing of advertising tools controlled and operated by the controller, which functioned in particular thanks to the data collected through connection tracers deposited on the terminals of users of the site operated by the controller (pt. 15 of the above-mentioned decision). 71. First of all, with regard to APPLE RETAIL FRANCE, the restricted formation notes that the information and identifiers deposited and/or read by ADI make it possible to feed the advertising tools that the latter develops and which are, in particular, part of the App Store integrated into the phones sold by APPLE RETAIL FRANCE. The operating system embedded in mobile terminals is marketed in France only on ADI's products through APPLE RETAIL FRANCE. The latter, whose mission is to market specifically in France the terminals manufactured by the APPLE group, while also offering a range of services, contributes to promoting the APPLE group's products. Thus, insofar as each telephone sold by APPLE RETAIL FRANCE contains the App Store application by default, the restricted formation considers that the latter's activity directly and necessarily contributes to the fact that people who own an iPhone can access the App Store and carry out searches, the results of which will be personalised by ADI. 72. In addition, with regard to APPLE FRANCE, the restricted formation notes that, in the context of the ""Search Ads"" service implemented by ADI allowing developers to promote their application to users on the App Store, APPLE FRANCE employs ""Search Ads Specialists"". According to the company, their role is ""to assist app publishers in understanding the tools provided by Apple in Search Ads, and to make recommendations on how best to optimise and structure their campaigns, for example, by assisting them in choosing keywords for the campaign based on the app to be promoted and helping them choose targeting criteria (geography, age, etc.). Therefore, the information and identifiers deposited and/or read by ADI allow developers who want their applications to be presented in the App Store to better target their audience. The fact that the ""Search Ads Specialists"" only generated an ""insignificant difference in revenue"" or do not themselves directly carry out an activity of ""promotion and marketing of advertising tools"" is inoperative. 73. Consequently, the restricted formation considers that an indissociable link is established between, on the one hand, the operation of reading and/or writing information to authenticate the DSID of a user account as well as those of the DPID and iAdId identifiers in the mobile terminals equipped with the iOS operating system of users residing in France during the use of the App Store by the company ADI and, on the other hand, the activities of APPLE FRANCE in that it advises application developers in their advertising campaigns and APPLE RETAIL FRANCE as promoter of the iOS operating system. 74. The restricted formation notes that the two criteria provided for in Article 3, paragraph I, of the Data Protection Act are therefore met. 75. It follows that French law is applicable and that the CNIL is materially and territorially competent to exercise its powers, including the power to impose sanctions on processing operations falling within the scope of the ePrivacy Directive. B. On the procedure 76. In its defence, the company first argues that the penalty procedure is based on facts that are obsolete or have not been found. It states that the ""report focuses on version 14.6 of iOS, the operating system for iPhones, which is not the updated version \[iOS 15\]"" and that, therefore, ""contrary to the Reporter's assertion \[...\] the personalised ad setting was in no way activated 'by default' at the date of the Report. Moreover, iOS 15 was available during most of the monitoring and investigation process prior to the Report's disclosure. During the hearing before the restricted panel, the company also argued that insofar as the CNIL control delegation did not create an account when the phone was initialised during its investigations, it was therefore unable to materially observe the reading and/or writing operations on which the rapporteur relied to characterise its breach of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act. 77. The company then argues that the procedure followed by the CNIL does not respect the right to a fair trial and the principles of foreseeability and legal certainty, as guaranteed by Articles 6 and 7 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. With regard to the right to a fair trial, the company considers firstly that its right not to participate in its own incrimination was violated insofar as, during the investigation phase, it voluntarily transmitted documents that were subsequently retained as ""incriminating evidence against it"" in the framework of the sanction procedure. It maintained that these elements had been obtained under duress or pressure because it was obliged to respond to the CNIL's requests under Article 18 of the Data Protection Act. Consequently, it considered that the restricted panel should close the procedure as it stood. The company then considered that it had not been given the time it needed to prepare its defence fairly, as its requests for an extension of the deadline for replying to the rapporteur had been systematically refused. It argues that ""distance time limits"" should have been applied simply because it is not in metropolitan France. It further argues that the principle of equality of arms was not respected because it was not given sufficient time to prepare the English translations of the ""essential documents of the sanction procedure"", namely the report and the rapporteur's reply. Finally, the company argues that the 'rapporteur did not include in his pleadings Apple's letter to the CNIL dated 30 March 2022 in which it submitted detailed observations on the minutes of the hearing of 16 March 2022 \[...\]'. With regard to the violation of the principles of foreseeability and legal certainty, ADI considers that it ""could not reasonably foresee that it \[APPLE RETAIL FRANCE\] was going to be implicated in the present proceedings"" when it had ""never received a request or question from the CNIL"". It therefore asked that the elements relating to this entity be set aside. 1. On the facts on which the procedure is based 78. 78. The restricted panel first noted that version 14.6 of the iPhone's operating system was the system available on the day of the online test on 16 June 2021 and that it was therefore legitimate for the analysis of the compliance of the processing operations implemented to focus on this system. Although the restricted panel notes the efforts that the company made during the procedure to create new parameters that would require users to accept that information be recorded and/or read in their terminal, the fact remains that the breach retained by the rapporteur is limited to version 14.6 of the iPhone operating system, on the basis of the observations made by the CNIL's inspection delegation. The restricted panel notes that the materiality of the operations of reading and/or writing information on the users' terminal within the meaning of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act is apparent from the answers provided by the company to the documentary checks and the existence of these operations is therefore established in the file for users of versions prior to version 14.6. 79. Accordingly, the Panel considers that it follows from these elements that the procedure is not based on ""obsolete facts"". 2. Respect for the right to a fair trial and the principles of foreseeability and legal certainty 80. The restricted formation considers first of all that, contrary to what the company maintains, the elements referred to in its writings were not obtained by coercion or pressure. It emphasised that the right not to contribute to one's own incrimination is intended, inter alia, to avoid miscarriages of justice through the use of pressure to obtain evidence. It also notes that under the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, the right not to incriminate oneself ""does not extend to the use in criminal proceedings of data which can be obtained from the accused by means of coercive powers but which exist independently of the suspect's will, for example documents collected under a warrant"" (ECHR, Saunders v. the United Kingdom, 17 December 1996) 81. In the present case, all the information gathered by the CNIL was gathered as part of a control procedure based on Article 19 of the Data Protection Act, through documentary and on-site checks, as well as during a hearing requested by the company. While the provisions of Article 18 of the Data Protection Act oblige the organisations inspected to provide the CNIL with the information requested, the restricted committee noted that the information provided by the company contained only objective facts describing the technical architecture of its ""Search Ads"" processing. 82. The restricted panel then recalls that when the supervisory delegation requests information, in particular factual information, from an organisation, no accusation has yet been made against it, so that the ""adversarial"" phase, as understood by the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, has not yet begun. The restricted panel also notes that the company then had ample opportunity to challenge the findings of the inspection delegation and their analysis by the rapporteur. 83. 83. Next, concerning the right to have the time and facilities necessary to prepare one's defence, the restricted formation recalls that this right is one of the components of the right to a fair trial contained in Article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and which must, in accordance with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, be analysed in the light of its function in the general context of the proceedings (see, inter alia, Mayzit v. Russia, 20 January 2005). 84. Moreover, pursuant to Article 40 of Decree No. 2019-536 of 29 May 2019, the implementation of the adversarial principle means that any document, argument, exhibit or reply letter must be communicated to the respondent, the rapporteur and the restricted formation. This article provides that the controller who is notified of a report proposing a sanction has, first of all, a period of one month to send his observations to the restricted panel and the rapporteur. When the circumstances of the case or the complexity of the matter so justify, the chairman of the restricted panel may decide, at the request of the body concerned, to extend this period by up to one month. The same article then grants the controller a second period of one month to respond to the rapporteur's observations in reply. These time limits are designed to ensure that the rights of defence are respected. Finally, the controller may present oral observations during the meeting before the restricted formation. 85. In this case, the restricted panel notes that the company was given a period of one month and 23 days to produce its observations, it being recalled that Article 40 of Decree No. 2019-536 of 29 May 2019 imposes a minimum period of one month. Furthermore, as the Conseil d'Etat recalled in its decision Société GOOGLE LLC of 19 June 2020, ""no rule or principle imposes the institution, in terms of administrative sanction procedure, of a time limit for distance, applicable to applicants domiciled outside metropolitan France"" (CE, 10th and 9th chambers combined, 27 June 2022, Société GOOGLE LLC, n° 430810, pt 13). Finally, given that the company was given a new period of time to submit written observations to the rapporteur's response, and that it was given the opportunity to express itself again before the restricted panel, the latter considers that the company's rights of defence have not been infringed. 86. In addition, with regard to the involvement of APPLE RETAIL FRANCE in the procedure, the restricted panel notes that the decision of the Commission President to initiate sanction proceedings only concerns APPLE DISTRIBUTION INTERNATIONAL. It therefore considers that, contrary to what is claimed, APPLE RETAIL FRANCE is not involved in the present procedure. It also considers that the elements introduced by the rapporteur in his writings concerning this company did not hinder the preparation of ADI's defence, insofar as they had been communicated by ADI itself concerning its membership of the APPLE group or were publicly accessible in the trade and companies register concerning its corporate purpose. 87. Finally, the restricted panel considers that the ""omission"" of the letter of 30 March 2022, to use the company's words, does not deprive it of procedural guarantees. This document submitted to the debate by ADI was examined by the restricted formation, which in any case is not in possession of documents of which the company was not aware. 88. Consequently, the restricted formation considers that it follows from these elements that the company's right to a fair trial as well as the principles of foreseeability and legal certainty have been respected. C. On the failure to comply with the provisions of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act with regard to version 14.6 of iOS 89. As recalled in point 36, Article 82 of the Data Protection Act is the transposition into domestic law of Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive. 90. The rapporteur, in proposing that the restricted panel consider that the company has failed to comply with its obligations under Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, bases himself on the fact that the operations of reading and/or writing information to authenticate the DSID of a user account and the DPID and iAdId identifiers on the user's terminal for advertising purposes requires that the latter has given his prior consent, under the conditions provided for by the provisions of Article 82 of the amended Act of 6 January 1978, as clarified by Article 4, paragraph 11, of the RGPD. 91. The rapporteur notes, firstly, that the findings show that at the end of the initialisation process on the phone equipped with the iOS 14.6 version of the operating system, the user was not presented with any mechanism designed to obtain his prior consent to the operations consisting in reading the aforementioned information and identifiers on his terminal. The rapporteur then notes that once the phone had been initialised, the delegation found that the tab entitled ""Personalised Advertisements"" in the ""Apple Advertising"" menu of the privacy settings was activated. He therefore considers that the user path of the iOS 14.6 version of the operating system did not allow for a valid collection of consent under the conditions set out in the above-mentioned Article 82. 92. The rapporteur then notes that the company stated that it had rolled out an update to the iOS operating system on 20 September 2021. This update obliged new users and those already equipped with an APPLE branded mobile device, for whom the ""Personalised Ads"" setting was activated and who could install the update, to make a choice when they first launched the App Store. This choice is manifested by a positive act and it is necessary to click on the ""Enable personalised ads"" button or the ""Disable personalised ads"" button, and thus concerns the user's acceptance that his or her personal data be processed for the purpose of targeted advertising. He notes that this new window constitutes an improvement in terms of consent gathering, insofar as the user is offered a choice relating to targeted advertising and could therefore constitute a valid mechanism for gathering consent to the reading of the above-mentioned information and identifiers on the user's terminal, pursuant to Article 82 of the above-mentioned law. Nevertheless, the rapporteur notes that the statement ""Apple does not track your activities"" is misleading, insofar as the reading and/or writing of the aforementioned information and identifiers on the user's mobile terminal is carried out for advertising purposes. Therefore, it makes this compliance subject to three conditions: that the window is written in French, that the statement ""Apple does not track your activities"" is amended and that no identifier is used for advertising purposes before the user's consent has been validly obtained via this window. 93. 93. In its defence, the company maintains firstly, as explained in paragraph 47, that the processing operations it carries out do not fall within the scope of the ePrivacy Directive or benefit from the exemption from the collection of consent within the meaning of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act. The company then argues that the new window designed to collect consent under the new version of the iOS 15 operating system has always been available in French. It considers that the information provided cannot be considered misleading or insufficiently accurate, but in any case indicates that the statement ""Apple does not track your activities"" should be replaced by ""Apple does not track your activities on third-party apps and sites"". It states that this change will be effective by March 2023. Finally, it confirms that no identifiers are stored on the device or read for advertising purposes before this window is presented to the user. 94. Firstly, the restricted formation recalls, as it developed in points 49 and following, that it considers that ADI carries out reading and/or writing operations on the user's terminal. 95. The restricted panel recalls that Article 82 of the Data Protection Act requires consent for operations of reading and writing information on a user's terminal, but provides for specific cases in which certain tracers benefit from an exemption from consent: either when the sole purpose of the tracer is to allow or facilitate communication by electronic means, or when it is strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user. 96. The restricted panel notes in this respect that the Commission specifies, in its guidelines of 17 September 2020, that ""the use of the same tracker for several purposes, some of which do not fall within the scope of these exemptions, requires the prior consent of the persons concerned, under the conditions recalled by these guidelines. For example, in the case of a service offered via a platform requiring user authentication (""logged-in universe""), the service provider may use a cookie to authenticate users without asking for their consent (because this cookie is strictly necessary for the provision of the online communication service). On the other hand, he may only use this same cookie for advertising purposes if the users have effectively given their prior consent to this specific purpose. 97. The restricted formation considers that in order to determine whether the operations of reading and/or writing of multi-purpose identifiers, such as DSIDs, DPIDs and iAdIds, on the users' terminal requires the prior collection of their consent, it is necessary to determine whether the purposes announced by the company are all exempt from the collection of consent. 98. With regard to the information attached to the DSID, the Panel considers that if this identifier is created for each user account on the APPLE group's servers, ""information"" is read on the user's terminal equipment to enable the association of requests made to a user account (i.e. the fact that the user carries out a search, and later to assign that unique user to segments within a universe that requires authentication (the so-called ""authenticated"" or ""logged in"" universe), in this case the App Store. Even though the main function of this ""information"" would be to allow the authentication of a user within a logged universe - and would be qualified as an essential purpose because it is strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user -, the fact that the information collected thanks to these tracers can be used to allow segmentation for advertising purposes necessarily prevents the said tracers from falling into the categories of tracers the reading of which is exempted from consent within the meaning of the above-mentioned Article 82. The restricted panel therefore considers that the company accesses information aimed at maintaining the authenticated connection, for several purposes: on the one hand, authentication and then maintenance of the user within the authenticated universe of the App Store and, on the other hand, the collection of traces of the user's activity in the context of the App Store in order to assign him or her or to reassign him or her to one or more segments which will subsequently be used to send him or her personalised advertisements intended to promote mobile applications on the App Store. 99. With regard to the replacement of information attached to the DSID by the DPID and iAdId identifiers on the users' terminal, the restricted formation first notes that the purpose of reading the DPID and iAdId identifiers stored in the user's terminal equipment and sending them to the company's servers is to disseminate advertisements for applications targeted according to the user's profile. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that these operations have an advertising purpose and are not exclusively intended to allow or facilitate communication by electronic means, nor are they strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user, within the meaning of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act. 100. Secondly, with regard to the argument that the steps relating to the replacement of information attached to the DSID by the DPID and the iAdId are implemented in order to respect the principles of protection of privacy and that, in their absence, the company could link the information relating to the advertisements disseminated to the user's identity, The restricted panel emphasised that the technical architecture underlying the ""Search Ads"" service in itself makes it possible to make subsequent processing related to the personalisation of ads less intrusive for the persons concerned. On the other hand, it considers that, since Article 82 of the Data Protection Act is applicable, it is necessary to respect its conditions, in particular those related to obtaining consent prior to any reading operation taking place on the user's terminal equipment, except for operations related to the functioning of electronic communications or strictly necessary to provide a service requested by the user. In other words, the restricted panel considers that the fact of implementing other measures to protect privacy at the design stage does not allow for exemption from the rule set out in Article 82 of the Data Protection Act. 101. Consequently, it considers that these operations require the user's prior consent, under the conditions provided for by Article 82 of the amended Act of 6 January 1978, as clarified by Article 4, paragraph 11, of the RGPD. 102. Secondly, the Select Committee notes that the consent of individuals must be unambiguous and that it follows from the ""Planet 49"" decision of 1 October 2019 of the CJEU that the use of pre-checked boxes cannot be considered as a clear positive act aimed at giving consent (CJEU, 1 Oct. 2019, C-673/17). Moreover, in the context of the guidelines of 17 September 2020, the Commission took care to specify that ""consent must be manifested by means of a positive action by the person who has previously been informed of the consequences of his choice and has the means to express it"". 103. In the present case, the restricted panel notes that it is clear from the findings in the section entitled ""Apple Advertising"" that the advertising targeting parameters are pre-checked by default. It considers that by being authorised ""by default"", the advertising targeting processes cannot be considered to have been accepted by a positive act by the users. 104. 104. The restricted formation also recalls that this stage of consent gathering comes late in the phase of the user's getting used to the phone and that it is optional because it is not integrated into the phone's initialization process. Furthermore, this step is only accessible after the user has clicked on the ""Settings"" icon on the iPhone, gone to the ""Privacy"" menu, and then clicked on the section entitled ""Apple Advertising"". The Commission considers that it is difficult for the user to validly accept or refuse these operations, insofar as the user who has completed the initialization process of his phone (a fortiori when the process includes a large number of steps as in the present case) may legitimately believe that he no longer needs to proceed with other configurations before consulting the App Store. 105. Finally, the restricted panel considers that the company is implementing data processing on a considerable scale given the predominant position of the Apple operating system on the French mobile operating system market and the proportion of telephone users in France who use ordiphones. It also notes that this targeting is based on people's interests and lifestyle habits and that the company's use of browsing and profile data from the App Store to target advertising is therefore significant. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that, in view of the scale of the processing and the imperative need for users to retain control of their data, they must be put in a position to give valid consent. 106. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that ADI is accessing information already stored or read on users' terminals for the purpose of personalising ads in the App Store without first obtaining their consent, in disregard of the provisions of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act. D. On the new window designed to collect consent under the new iOS 15 version of the operating system 107. The panel notes that the new consent box for the new version of the operating system iOS 15 is written in French. It notes that the company undertakes to complete the statement ""Apple does not track your activities"" by March 2023. Finally, it notes that no identifiers are used for ad personalisation purposes in the App Store before this window is presented to the user. 108. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that this new window constitutes a mechanism for obtaining prior valid consent to the reading of the aforementioned information and identifiers on the user's terminal, pursuant to Article 82 of the amended Act of 6 January 1978. 109. The restricted formation considers that a breach of the obligations arising from Article 82 of the Data Protection Act was constituted for the past on version 14.6 of the operating system since it was incumbent on the company to obtain the consent of users prior to writing and/or reading information on their terminal equipment for the purpose of personalising advertisements intended to promote mobile applications on the App Store. It noted that, in the context of the present procedure, the company had justified having taken measures to comply with the obligations arising from Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, which did not, however, call into question the existence of the breach for past events. III. Corrective measures and their publicity 111. Under the terms of Article 20 III of the Data Protection Act : ""When the data controller or its processor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or from this law, the president of the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés may also, where appropriate after having sent it the warning provided for in I of this article or, where appropriate, in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted formation of the commission with a view to the pronouncement, after an adversarial procedure, of one or more of the following measures : (...) 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine that may not exceed 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the total annual worldwide turnover for the previous financial year, whichever is higher. In the cases referred to in Articles 5 and 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, these ceilings shall be increased to EUR 20 million and 4% of the said turnover respectively. The restricted formation shall take into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same Article 83."" 112. Under Article 83 of the GDPR, as referred to in Article 20(III) of the Data Protection Act: ""1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this Article for violations of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 2. Depending on the specific features of each case, administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). In deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the amount of the administrative fine, due account shall be taken in each individual case of the following factors (a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, having regard to the nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them ; (b) whether the breach was committed intentionally or negligently; (c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects; (d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical and organisational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32 ; (e) any previous relevant breach by the controller or processor; (f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach and mitigating any adverse effects; (g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach; (h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, including whether and to what extent the controller or processor notified the breach; (i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned in respect of the same matter, compliance with those measures; (j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or certification schemes approved pursuant to Article 42; and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstances applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as the financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, as a result of the breach. "" A. On the imposition of an administrative fine 113. In its defence, the company considers, primarily, that it cannot be accused of any violation of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act and, therefore, that no fine can be imposed on it. In this respect, it points out that the processing for the purpose of personalising ads on the App Store that it implements is carried out either on its servers and is not part of the scope of the CNIL's investigations, or on users' terminals solely for the purpose of ""protecting privacy"" and therefore falls within the scope of the exemptions provided for in Article 82 of the Data Protection Act. In the alternative, the company considers that the amount of the fine proposed by the rapporteur is disproportionate and that several criteria provided for in Article 83(2) of the GDPR are inoperative in this case, in particular those referring to the nature, seriousness and scope of the processing and the level of harm suffered by individuals. It further argues that the consent window in the new iOS 15 version of the operating system was always available in French for users who selected that language, contrary to what the rapporteur argued. It further argues that the worldwide turnover is not a relevant criterion to be taken into account when deciding the amount of the fine itself and that its only function is to prevent the amount retained by the restricted formation from exceeding the ceiling provided for by the GDPR. It adds that the amount proposed by the rapporteur corresponds to \[...\]. Finally, it notes that the fine proposed by the rapporteur is out of all proportion to the fines it has already imposed. 114. In view of the elements developed above, the restricted formation considers that the above-mentioned facts, constituting a breach of Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, justify the imposition of an administrative fine on ADI, the legal entity responsible for the processing. The Commission recalls that the changes made by the company to the window for collecting consent in the new version iOS 15 of the operating system since September 2021 have no bearing on the imposition of a fine insofar as the fine is intended to punish the facts observed during inspections concerning the iOS 14.6 version of the iPhone operating system. 115. The restricted formation recalls that Article 20, paragraph III, of the Data Protection Act gives it the power to impose various sanctions, in particular an administrative fine, the maximum amount of which may be equivalent to 2% of the total annual worldwide turnover of the previous financial year achieved by the controller. It adds that the determination of the amount of this fine is assessed in the light of the criteria specified in Article 83 of the RGPD. 116. In the case in point, the restricted formation considers that the breach in question justifies the imposition of an administrative fine on the company for the following reasons. 117. First of all, the restricted panel notes the seriousness of the breach, insofar as the ad personalisation parameters are pre-checked by default, the company carried out operations to read and/or write information or identifiers on the terminals of users located in France for the purpose of personalising ads without first obtaining their consent and deprived them of the possibility of exercising their choice in accordance with the provisions of Article 82 above. 118. The restricted formation considers that the seriousness of the breach is accentuated by the fact that this stage of consent gathering occurred late in the phase of the user taking control of the telephone and that it was optional because it was not integrated into the telephone initialisation process. 119. The restricted formation observes that the seriousness of the breach must also be assessed in the light of the scope of the read and write operations in question and the number of persons concerned. As regards the scope of the read and write operations, the restricted formation notes that Apple's App Store is the only official distribution channel for mobile applications on iOS devices for developers, since the company does not allow applications to be downloaded outside its App Store. People using the iOS 14.6 version of the iPhone operating system are therefore dependent on the choices made by ADI regarding their privacy. 121. With regard to the number of people concerned by the operations of reading and/or writing the above-mentioned information and identifiers on their mobile terminal, it appears from the information provided by the company that 27.5 million mobile terminals equipped with the operating system connected to the French App Store using an IP address registered in France between 5 July 2020 and 5 July 2021 (for free or paid downloads, re-downloads or updates). While this number does not mean that 27.5 million users did not consent to read and/or write the above information and credentials on their mobile device, it does reflect the company's significant position in the mobile operating system market. 122. Secondly, the restricted formation considers that ADI, which has achieved a worldwide turnover for the year 2021 of approximately \[...\] dollars, i.e. approximately \[...\] euros (according to the current exchange rate), has derived a definite financial advantage from the infringement committed. Indeed, as indicated above, the read and/or write operations allow the company to present users, when they search the App Store, with personalised advertisements promoting applications. The panel notes that while the company's main activity is the sale and distribution of APPLE group products in Europe, the personalisation of ads enables it to increase its revenue. However, by not obtaining the consent of users to read and/or write the aforementioned information and identifiers, the company increases the number of users to whom the personalisation of ads will be carried out. 123. The Panel notes, however, as a mitigating circumstance, that the steps relating to the replacement of information attached to the DSID by the DPID and the iAdId are implemented in order to respect the principles of privacy protection and that in their absence, the company could link the information relating to the advertisements broadcast to the identity of the user, which would further infringe his privacy. 124 It follows from all the above and the criteria duly taken into account by the restricted formation, in view of the maximum amount incurred, established on the basis of 2% of turnover, that it is justified to impose an administrative fine of EUR 8 million. B. On the publicity of the decision 125 In its defence, the company argued that such a measure would be neither necessary nor proportionate in light of the alleged infringement that it refutes and its compliance with the new consent collection window available under version iOS 15 of the operating system. 126. The Panel considers that in view of the above, an additional advertising sanction is justified. Account is also taken of the dominant position of the Apple operating system on the French market for mobile operating systems and the proportion of telephone users in France who use ordiphones, the seriousness of the infringement and the interest that this decision represents for the information of the public, in determining the duration of its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The CNIL's restricted formation, after having deliberated, decides to : - to impose an administrative fine on APPLE DISTRIBUTION INTERNATIONAL in the amount of 8,000,000 (eight million) euros for failure to comply with Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act; - to make its decision public on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, which will no longer identify the company by name after a period of two years from its publication. The Chairman Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be appealed to the Council of State within four months of its notification.

Facts and procedure 1. Founded in 2005 in France, the company CRITEO SA (hereinafter the ""company"") specializes in the display of targeted advertising on the web. In 2022, the CRITEO group employed around 3,000 employees and had achieved overall revenue of around €1.9 billion for a net profit of around €10 million. 2. The company implements so-called ""advertising retargeting"" data processing, which consists of monitoring the browsing habits of Internet users to display them personalized advertisements, by means of cookies placed in user terminals. 3. On November 8, 2018, the National Commission for Computing and Liberties (hereinafter ""the CNIL"" or ""the Commission"") received a complaint from the association ""Privacy International"", which underlined in particular that the company did not process the data of Internet users in accordance with the principles set out in Article 5, paragraph 1, of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016, relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter ""the GDPR""). 4. On December 4, 2018, the CNIL received a complaint sent by the association ""None of Your Business"" (hereinafter ""NOYB"") mandated by \[…\], which denounced the formalism imposed by the company on from which he had wished to withdraw his consent and oppose the processing of his data (hereinafter ""the complainant""). The complainant reported that, despite sending an e-mail to this effect to the company, the latter had redirected him to various online procedures devoted to the exercise of rights. 5. On January 14, 2019, in accordance with Article 56 of the GDPR, the CNIL informed all the European supervisory authorities of its competence to act as lead supervisory authority concerning the cross-border processing implemented by the company, competence derived by the CNIL from the fact that the main establishment of the company is in France. 6. After discussions between data protection authorities, it turned out that all European authorities are concerned within the meaning of Article 4, 22) of the GDPR. 7. As part of the investigation of the complaint filed by the NOYB association, the CNIL questioned the company on the follow-up given to the complainant's requests. This instruction gave rise to an exchange of letters between the CNIL and the company, dated March 27, April 29, September 9, October 9, December 27, 2019 and February 17, 2020. A meeting was also held on January 17 2020. 8. In the extension of this instruction and in application of decision no. 2020-005C of December 27, 2019 of the President of the Commission, a CNIL delegation carried out several checks at the company in order to verify compliance with the provisions of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter ""the Data Protection Act"" or ""law of January 6, 1978"") and the GDPR. 9. Thus, on January 29, 2020, the delegation sent a questionnaire to the company, to which the latter replied on March 27, 2020, relating to its organization, the processing of personal data that it implements, the its qualification as data controller, on its relations with its customers and partners and on its management of requests to exercise rights. 10. On 16 and 17 September 2020, the delegation carried out an on-site inspection at the company's premises, during which it notably carried out checks on the websites of two of the company's partners. The delegation also checked the follow-up given to the request to exercise the complainant's rights and obtained information on the procedures for implementing the right to withdraw consent and the right to erasure. The on-site inspection gave rise to two reports no. 2020-005/1 and 2020-005/2, notified to the company on September 30, 2020. 11. On October 13, 2020, based on a list provided by the company of the hundred websites from which it collects the most data, the delegation carried out an online check of several of these sites to check in particular the terms of the deposit of the Criteo cookie in the user's terminal and the device implemented to collect their consent. The online check gave rise to a report no. 2020-005/3, notified to the company on October 14, 2020. 12. On June 23, 2021, on the basis of Article 22 of the law of January 6, 1978, the President of the Commission appointed Mr François PELLEGRINI as rapporteur for the purposes of examining these elements. 13. On June 9, 2022, the rapporteur sent an additional request to the company to receive, in particular, the latest versions of the general conditions of use of Criteo services, as well as a recent sample of contracts concluded by the company with its partners. . The company responded on June 17, 2022. 14. On August 3, 2022, at the end of his investigation, the rapporteur notified the company of a report detailing the breaches of Articles 7, 12, 13, 15, 17 and 26 of the GDPR that he considered constituted in l 'species. 15. This report proposed that the restricted committee of the Commission impose an administrative fine on the company in an amount that could not be less than sixty million euros. He also proposed that this decision be made public and no longer allow the company to be identified by name after the expiry of a period of two years from its publication. 16. On October 31, 2022, the company submitted observations in response to the rapporteur's report. 17. On December 7, 2022, the rapporteur responded to the company's observations. 18. On January 30, 2023, the company submitted new observations in response to those of the rapporteur. 19. By letter dated February 21, 2023, the rapporteur informed the company's board that the investigation was closed, pursuant to Article 40, III, of decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 issued for the application of the Data Protection Act. 20. The rapporteur and the company presented oral observations during the restricted training session of March 16, 2023. II. Reasons for decision A. On the European cooperation procedure 21. Pursuant to Article 60(3) of the GDPR, the draft decision adopted by the Restricted Committee was sent on 16 May 2023 to the European supervisory authorities concerned. 22. As of 13 June 2023, none of the supervisory authorities concerned had raised a relevant and reasoned objection to this draft decision, so that, pursuant to Article 60(6) of the GDPR , the latter are deemed to have approved it. B. On the processing in question, the qualification of personal data and the responsibility for processing. 1. On the processing in question for the purpose of displaying personalized advertising 23. Article 4, 2) of the GDPR defines processing as ""any operation or set of operations whether or not carried out by automated means and applied to personal data or sets of personal data, such as the collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, dissemination or any other form of making available , reconciliation or interconnection, limitation, erasure or destruction"". 24. In the present case, the Restricted Committee notes that the company implements so-called ""advertising retargeting"" data processing for the purpose of displaying personalized advertising (hereinafter the ""processing in question""). 25. In concrete terms, the company collects Internet users' browsing data using cookies which are placed on their terminals when they visit one of the sites of their \[…\] partners, including publishers and advertisers. When an Internet user visits a partner's website, the company places a cookie in the terminal of his browser, which is assigned a unique identifier, called Criteo ID, which will allow him to recognize him during his future visits. on other partner sites. 26. Thus, when an Internet user visits the website of a partner advertiser, the company records in its database the actions of the Internet user via the cookie (for example, the visit to the home page, the connection to a user account, clicking on a ""product"" page, adding an item to the shopping cart). 27. Then, when the Internet user visits the website of a partner publisher, the publisher sends a request to the company in order to send it information such as the size of the advertising insert, the nature of the publisher site as well as an identifier allowing the company to recognize the Internet user. 28. The company then uses its data processing technologies to determine which advertising would be the most relevant to display to the Internet user according to his browsing habits and the products or services that could interest him. Based on this analysis, the company then participates in a real-time bidding or ""RTB"" auction for the display of an advertisement on the publisher's advertising space. If the company wins the auction, an advertiser's banner ad is displayed in the insert available on the publisher's website. 29. Thus, as an intermediary between advertisers and publishers of websites, the company helps, on the one hand, advertisers to reach their target audience with more relevant advertisements, on the other hand, publishers to enhance their advertising space. 30. The Restricted Committee notes that the company acknowledges implementing the processing described in the preceding paragraphs. 2. On the qualification of personal data of the data processed by the company CRITEO 31. Article 4, 1) of the GDPR defines personal data as ""any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as ""data subject""); is deemed to be an ""identifiable natural person"" a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier, such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more specific elements specific to his physical, physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural or social identity. 32. Recital 30 of the GDPR, which is part of well-established case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU, 24 Nov. 2011, Scarlet Extended SA C 70/10, pt. 51 and 19 Oct. 2016, Breyer, C-582/14) provides that an online identifier associated with a natural person, such as an IP address or a cookie, can ""leave traces which, in particular when they are combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, can be used to create profiles of natural persons and to identify these persons"". 33. In its aforementioned Breyer judgment, delivered under the influence of Directive 95/46/EC, the CJEU stressed the importance of a casuistical approach to the identifying or non-identifying nature of data rather than a general position and of principle. It indicated that, in order to determine whether a person is identifiable, it was necessary to take into consideration all the means likely to be reasonably implemented, either by the controller or by another person, to identify the said person. . 34. The rapporteur considers that the company processes personal data, given that given the number and diversity of data collected and the fact that they are all linked to an identifier, it is possible, with reasonable means, to re-identify the natural persons to whom this data relates. 35. The company considers that it deals with ""browsing events"", which are pseudonymised technical data that do not allow it to directly identify the Internet users to whom they are attached. It maintains that it is only required to recognize the identity of a person in the event of a request for a right of access where it can make the correspondence between the Criteo cookie identifier (Criteo ID) and the identity of the natural person. Apart from such a hypothesis, it considers that the risk of re-identification is very low and produces simulations carried out by service providers on this point. 36. It draws the conclusion that since it only processes pseudonymised data, any breaches it may have committed have had a very limited impact for the persons concerned, which the restricted committee should take into account in its assessment. . 37. The Restricted Committee points out that only true anonymization of the data processed, by causing the data to lose their ""personal"" character, that is to say, without the possibility of re-identifying the natural person to whom they relate, would escape the processing to all GDPR requirements. 38. In this case, the Restricted Committee notes that while the company does not claim to process anonymised data, it claims to process only pseudonymised data presenting a very low risk of re-identification. 39. The Restricted Committee also notes that the Criteo ID cookie identifier, assigned by the company by means of the cookies it deposits, is intended to distinguish each individual whose data it collects and that a great deal of information intended to enrich the Internet user's advertising profile are associated with this identifier, including: - data related to the identification of the person: geographical location from IP address, Criteo user identifier, terminal identifier, identifiers provided by partners, e-mail address in hashed form provided by partners; - data related to the activity of the person, which corresponds to the monitoring of the Internet user's browsing history through the sites visited, the products consulted, those added to the basket as well as the act of purchase. This also includes the possible interactions of the user with the advertisements presented to him (has the user clicked on the banner? has he made a purchase?); - data derived or inferred from the previous information in order to be able to offer the user the most relevant products, taking into account his centers of interest. 40. Thus, the Restricted Committee notes that if the company does not directly have the identity of the natural persons to whom the terminals on which cookies are registered are linked, re-identification may be facilitated by the fact that, in certain cases, the company collects, in addition to data related to browsing events, other data that facilitates re-identification such as the email addresses of people who have made their browsing journey from an authenticated (or ""logged in"") environment in hashed form, identifiers corresponding generated by other actors, the IP address in hashed form or even the user agent of the terminal used. 41. Consequently, when the company is able to re-identify persons by reasonable means, the data processed retains a personal character, within the meaning of Article 4, 1) of the GDPR. 42. It follows that the GDPR is applicable and that, in view of what has been indicated above, the company is responsible for processing the processing in question. C. Failure to comply with the obligation to be able to demonstrate that the person concerned has given his consent 43. According to Article 6(1) of the GDPR: ""processing is only lawful if and insofar as at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: (a) the data subject has consented to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes; b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the performance of pre-contractual measures taken at the request of the data subject; c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; d) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; f) the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular when the data subject is a child. Point f) of the first paragraph does not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks”. 44. Under Article 4, 11) of the GDPR, consent is defined as ""any expression of will, free, specific, informed and unambiguous by which the data subject accepts, by a declaration or by a clear positive act, that personal data concerning him are processed"". 45. Article 7, paragraph 1, of the GDPR relating to the conditions applicable to consent provides that: ""in cases where the processing is based on consent, the controller is able to demonstrate that the data subject has given his consent to the processing of personal data concerning him"". 46. The rapporteur considers that the company has not put in place any measure allowing it to ensure that the personal data it processes are only those for which the person's valid consent has been obtained. It notes in this that among the websites controlled by the CNIL, more than half of the sites published by its partners did not obtain valid consent and that the company had not implemented an audit mechanism for its partners. 47. The company, invoking the Fashion ID judgment (CJEU, July 29, 2019, C 40/17), argues that its partners, who have the status of joint controllers, remain the best placed to collect the consent of data subjects. concerned in that the Criteo cookie is placed in the terminal of Internet users when browsing their website. 48. The company adds that as such, the various agreements entered into with its partners pursuant to Article 26 of the GDPR (in particular the aforementioned General Conditions of Use of Services and its Data Protection Agreement) provide that this obligation comes back to them. It considers that this contractual distribution is sufficient to ensure compliance with this obligation, which is binding on its partners by virtue of the principle of the binding force of contracts. 49. It maintains that there is nothing to establish that the practices observed on the twelve websites visited by the delegation of control would be representative of the state of compliance of its \[…\] partners. 50. Although it claims not to have any specific obligation to ensure that its partners have validly obtained the consent of the persons concerned, the company nevertheless emphasizes that it does not hesitate to terminate the contracts concluded with those who do not respect their obligations. in terms of obtaining the consent of Internet users. 51. It adds that it has implemented other control mechanisms, such as an audit strategy for its partners which, as of 31 October 2022, made it possible to verify the compliance status of nearly \[…\] of its partners, as well as a so-called ""Know your client"" process by which it verifies the compliance of its future partners with several regulatory requirements (presence of a cookie banner and a confidentiality policy) prior to the conclusion of a service contract with them. Finally, it indicates that it terminated its contract with one of its partners who had been checked by the CNIL delegation and that it sent a warning to another partner that did not comply with the applicable regulations regarding the collection of consent from Internet users. 52. The Restricted Committee recalls that in the event of joint responsibility, Article 26 of the GDPR obliges the joint controllers to ensure, by means of an agreement, that they mutually respect the GDPR and in particular that they organize among themselves the best way to respond to the rights of the data subjects, depending on the nature of the processing and their respective responsibility vis-à-vis this processing. 53. It points out that in points 167 and 168 of its guidelines 07/2020 concerning the notions of controller and processor in the GDPR, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) considers that in the event of of joint responsibility, ""both controllers are always required to ensure that they both have a legal basis for the processing"" and that they ""may have a certain degree of flexibility in the distribution and allocation of the obligations between them, provided that they ensure full compliance with the requirements of the GDPR with regard to the specific processing”. 54. Firstly, with regard to the respective roles and obligations of the Criteo company and the partner sites, the Restricted Committee notes that in the context of its processing for the purpose of displaying personalized advertising, the company processes the data to personal nature of Internet users visiting the sites of its partners which are previously collected via the Criteo cookie. 55. It also notes that the company and the sites of its partners from which the Criteo cookie is deposited in the terminal of Internet users are jointly responsible for the operations of depositing the Criteo cookie and the collection of data of Internet users operated thanks to this cookies. 56. With regard to the legal framework applicable to these different processing operations, the Restricted Committee recalls that if the deposit of the Criteo cookie in the terminal of the Internet user visiting a partner's website and which allows the company to assign a unique identifier to this Internet user is subject to the provisions of Article 5, paragraph 3, of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 on the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (hereinafter the ""ePrivacy"" directive), transposed into French law in article 82 of the Data Protection Act, the subsequent processing for advertising purposes, which is operated from personal data personal data collected through this cookie, is subject to the provisions of the GDPR. 57. With regard to the legal basis applicable to these different processing operations, the Restricted Committee first recalls that under the ""ePrivacy"" directive, the operations of reading or writing information in the terminal of 'a user can not be implemented without the prior consent of the latter. 58. It then notes, with regard to the processing in question, that the company indicated to the delegation of control in its response to the questionnaire of January 29, 2020 that: ""all the processing that we carry out as part of our advertisements in Europe are based on user consent”. In addition, the company's processing confidentiality policy also mentions consent as the applicable legal basis for the purposes of displaying personalized advertising, whether targeted or contextual. 59. The Restricted Committee notes that, according to a constant position of the CNIL, the articulation of the rules of the ""ePrivacy"" directive and the GDPR allows the publisher of the site from which the cookie is deposited to obtain the consent necessary for the deposit of the cookie at the same time as that necessary for the subsequent processing implemented from the data collected by this cookie. 60. Specifically, it notes, in this case, that the company has organized itself in such a way with its partners that the general conditions of use of Criteo services, to which the company's partners have adhered, specify that it is up to the partner to obtain the consent of the person concerned for the subsequent processing carried out from the data collected by this cookie. 61. The Restricted Committee considers, however, that the fact that the collection of the consent of Internet users for the implementation of the processing in question is the responsibility of the partners does not exonerate the company from its obligation, pursuant to Article 7 of the GDPR, d be able to demonstrate that the person concerned has given his consent. 62. This dual liability regime makes it possible to guarantee that at all stages of the processing of data collected during the navigation of a user on one of the company's partner sites, each joint data controller complies with the obligations which it is responsible: for the partners, those relating to the deposit and reading of the Criteo cookie in the user's terminal and, for the company, those relating to the subsequent processing carried out from the data collected by means of this cookie. 63. Data subjects should effectively benefit from the protection offered by the texts in force to which they are entitled throughout their navigation and, in particular, that their data should only be processed by the company if they have requested it. previously and validly consented. 64. In addition, the company's core business consists of transforming raw navigation data into valuable information that it uses. Since the company plays a central role in the advertising ecosystem, it must all the more be able to ensure that the processing in question complies with the regulations in force. 65. Finally, the Restricted Committee notes that the Fashion ID judgment, invoked by the company, relates to the question of whether the site manager (the Fashion Id company) or the cookie publisher (the Facebook company) should obtain the consent of the persons concerned before depositing the cookie published by Facebook and that it has been issued under the influence of Directive 95/46/EC relating to data protection. 66. Insofar as the European legislator intended to strengthen the rights of individuals and the accountability of actors by establishing, in particular, the obligation for the data controller to be able to demonstrate that the person whose data he is processing has actually given its consent, pursuant to Article 7(1) of the GDPR, the Restricted Committee considers that the reference to the Fashion ID judgment is not relevant in this case. 67. Secondly, the Restricted Committee notes that in the context of the online checks carried out during the on-site check of 16 September 2020 and during the online check of 13 October 2020, the delegation noted on seven partner websites of the company that a Criteo cookie had been placed in the terminal used on this occasion, as soon as it arrived on the home page without it having performed the slightest action, whereas at the time of these findings, the CNIL had already had the opportunity to recall that such practices were in direct contravention of the provisions of the Data Protection Act applicable to cookies. 68. The Restricted Committee also notes that in three cases, the site visited did not allow the user to refuse cookies other than by setting their browser, which does not constitute a mechanism for valid refusal of consent, whereas, in two cases, a Criteo cookie was deposited after the delegation had expressed its refusal to this deposit. 69. In addition, during the on-site inspection of September 16, 2020, the delegation noted that the two sites visited did not include any mechanism allowing the collection of consent to the deposit of cookies, such as a button or a checkbox . Several events related to browsing these two sites were recorded in the company's database, such as visiting the pages of products sold by the company's partners. 70. It emerges from all of these checks that the absence of collection of valid consent was observed by the delegation on nearly one in two sites visited. However, the Restricted Committee also notes that nine of the twelve sites visited by the CNIL services were indicated by the company itself, as those generating the most data collected in its database. 71. While it is true that the inspection procedure did not make it possible to verify all of the sites of the \[…\] partners of the company, the Restricted Committee considers that it can reasonably be inferred from the aforementioned findings that on the date of the checks, the company was processing a large volume of browsing data for which Internet users had not given valid consent. 72. Thirdly, the Restricted Committee notes that on the date of the initiation of the control procedure, the company had not implemented any satisfactory measure allowing it to be considered to be in compliance with the requirements of the 7(1) GDPR. 73. Thus, the Restricted Committee notes that at the start of the control procedure, to the question of the delegation aimed at knowing the measures put in place by the company to ensure the validity of the consent, in the event that it had to delegate the collection of this consent to a third party, the latter had limited itself to reproducing a mention of its general conditions of use, in their applicable version of May 2016, under the terms of which the company required its partners, ""when the law provides for it"", that the confidentiality policy of their site includes ""notices and mechanisms of choice in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations"". 74. However, the Restricted Committee considers that such a clause does not, on its own, guarantee the existence of a valid consent and that it should at the very least be supplemented to specify that the organization who obtains the consent must make proof of the consent available to the other party, so that each data controller wishing to rely on it can effectively report it. 75. In the present case, the Restricted Committee notes that on the date of initiation of the control procedure, this clause was not only not supplemented by a specific clause relating to proof of consent, but also that the company had also admitted that it had never terminated a contract due to a partner's non-compliance with its contractual obligations, nor implemented any other measure to control its partners. 76. In this sense, the Restricted Committee notes that the various measures put forward by the company were only gradually deployed from 2020, after the start of the control procedure initiated in January 2020. 77. The Restricted Committee thus takes note of the audit campaign conducted by the company with its partners since 2020 and of the fact that the company has also terminated the contract binding it to one of them who did not respect not its cookie obligations. 78. It also notes that in subsequent versions of its general terms and conditions of use, the company inserted a clause relating to proof of consent according to which the partner undertakes to ""promptly provide Criteo, on request and at any time, proof that a consent of the data subject has been obtained by the partner"". 79. In view of these elements, the Restricted Committee considers that the company has complied with the requirements of Article 7(1) of the GDPR. 80. It nevertheless emphasizes that this compliance, which occurred belatedly, has no effect on the fact that the company processed the personal data of Internet users without being able to demonstrate that they have validly consented to the processing for the purpose of the display of personalized advertising, in violation of Article 7(1) GDPR. D. On the breach of the obligations of information and transparency 81. Article 12, paragraph 1, of the GDPR provides that: ""The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 as well as to carry out any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 as regards processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible manner, in clear and simple terms, in particular for any information intended specifically for a child. writing or by other means including, where appropriate, electronically"". 82. Pursuant to Article 13 of the GDPR, the controller must provide the data subject with the following information: ""a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller's representative; b) where applicable, the contact details of the data protection officer; c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing; d) where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party; e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if they exist; And f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a third country or to an international organization, and the existence or absence of a decision to adequacy rendered by the Commission or, in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the reference to the appropriate or suitable guarantees and the means of obtaining one copy or the place where they have been made available"". 83. In the present case, the rapporteur maintains that the information provided by the company to the persons concerned was not complete in that it did not indicate all the purposes relating to the processing in question in the version of its confidentiality policy. applicable on the date of the findings, in particular the purpose relating to the improvement of its technologies. 84. The rapporteur also criticizes a lack of clarity as to the legal basis of consent applicable to processing, which the company specified differs depending on the country, and as to the purposes implemented on the basis of legitimate interest. 85. The company responds that it has updated its privacy policy. 86. In any event, it disputes the first complaint, considering that it did not have to specify the purpose of improving its technologies since, in its view, this purpose includes technical elements contributing globally to the same purpose. than the display of personalized advertisements. 87. On the second complaint, it argues that any ambiguities denounced by the rapporteur never prevented the persons concerned from exercising their rights. 88. In its second observations, the company argues that no breach on its part of the obligations arising from Article 13 of the GDPR can be blamed on it insofar as it would only carry out an indirect collection of data. 89. The Restricted Committee recalls, firstly, that the GDPR distinguishes the system from the obligation to inform which is imposed on the data controller depending on the nature of the data collection: the data controller is subject to the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR when the data is collected directly from the data subject and the provisions of Article 14 of the GDPR in the opposite case. 90. It adds that in point 26 of its guidelines of 29 November 2017 on transparency, in their revised version of 11 April 2018, the EDPS recalls that Article 13 of the GDPR also applies when the data is collected by the data controller ""by observation"", i.e. when the data controller collects the data through the use of sensors of any kind. 91. The Restricted Committee notes that the Council of State adopted the same interpretation in a decision rendered before the entry into force of the GDPR, considering that the fact that the collection does not require any intervention by the persons concerned had no impact on the direct nature of this collection (Council of State, 10th - 9th chambers combined, February 8, 2017, JCDecaux, no. 393714). 92. In the present case, the Restricted Committee notes that the data is indeed collected by the company directly from the Internet user, since when the latter browses the website of a partner of the company, the requests of the cookie Criteo allowing the latter to know that a user arrives on the home page, connects to an account or clicks on a ""product"" page, are sent directly to its servers, without passing through another data controller. 93. As the data is collected from individuals, the Restricted Committee concludes that Article 13 of the GDPR applies to the company. 94. Secondly, the Restricted Committee notes that the general conditions of use of Criteo services provide that the company's partners must integrate into their website a personal data protection policy including a link to the privacy policy from Criteo. 95. It notes that the ""Legal basis for data processing"" section of the company's privacy policy, in the version applicable on the date of the findings, stated that: ""Criteo's processing operations comply with the regulations in force, in countries requiring user consent for the use of cookies or other similar technology. This consent is collected on the websites and mobile applications of Advertisers and Publishers"". 96. Furthermore, it was also mentioned under the same section that: ""Criteo considers that it has a legitimate interest in processing your data for the purposes expressed in this privacy policy, in particular to: - respect the commercial agreements made with our customers and partners; - allow our Advertisers to promote their products and services; - allow our Publishers to finance their activities"". 97. The Restricted Committee considers, first, that the first formulation creates uncertainty as to the legal basis of the processing in that it does not allow Internet users located within the European Union to understand that the processing of their data is based on their consent. 98. Next, it considers that the purposes announced by the company in the second formulation are expressed in vague and broad terms which do not allow the user to understand precisely what personal data is used and for what purposes. Furthermore, the Restricted Committee considers it contradictory to mention that the purposes relating to the promotion of advertisers' products and the financing of the activities of publishers are based on the legal basis of legitimate interest when these purposes are directly linked to the processing of display of personalized advertising, which is based, according to the company itself, on the legal basis of the consent of Internet users. The Restricted Committee adds that such an approximate and contradictory description of the purposes pursued on the basis of legitimate interest is liable to hinder the exercise by the persons concerned of their right to object, which is intrinsically linked to the quality of the information delivered. 99. The Restricted Committee notes that the company has responded to these shortcomings in the new version of its confidentiality policy, since the latter now specifies that consent applies to persons residing in the European Economic Area and that it includes a table summarizing all the purposes of its processing, including those based on the legal basis of legitimate interest, which includes a detailed description of these purposes and the categories of data concerned. The Restricted Committee observes that the company has also put an end to the contradiction noted above. 100. Thirdly, the Restricted Committee notes that the ""Purpose of the processing of personal data"" section of the company's privacy policy, in the version applicable on the date of the findings, contained only the following line: ""Criteo processes your personal data for personalized ads"". 101. However, during the on-site inspection of September 16 and 17, 2020, the company specified to the delegation that the processing also made it possible ""to optimize the responses to be given at auction, the selection of items to be presented in an advertisement and propose the best layout for this banner"". 102. While the Restricted Committee admits that certain technical operations described by the company contribute directly to the main purpose of displaying personalized advertising, it considers that others serve a distinct purpose. 103. Indeed, the company uses the data collected through cookies in order to improve its own technologies (so-called ""machine learning"" purpose, mobilizing the data collected by the company to self-configure algorithmic targeting processing). Thus, the main objective of this subsequent processing is to improve the effectiveness of the advertising targeting carried out by Criteo in general. It is therefore a separate purpose, which should be brought to the attention of the persons concerned. 104. The Restricted Committee notes that in the new version of its privacy policy, posted online on November 4, 2022, the company now clearly distinguishes, under the ""Use of your data"" section, on the one hand, the purpose of ""display of personalized advertising"" and, on the other hand, the purpose of ""model training"", defined as making it possible to ""improve the performance of Criteo's advertising operations"". 105. It follows from the foregoing that by not providing data subjects with all of the information provided, by using insufficiently clear and precise terms and by presenting an erroneous legal basis for processing, the company has failed in its transparency and information obligations provided for in Articles 12 and 13 of the GDPR. However, it notes that the company has complied during this procedure. E. On the breach of the obligation to respect the right of access of data subjects to personal data concerning them 106. Article 12, paragraph 1, of the GDPR provides that: ""The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 as well as to carry out any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 with regard to the processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, understandable and easily accessible manner, in clear and simple terms"". 107. Article 15(1) of the GDPR provides that: ""The data subject has the right to obtain confirmation from the controller as to whether personal data relating to him or her are being processed and, where are, access to said personal data \[…\]”. 108. In this case, as part of the investigations carried out by the CNIL, the company provided the delegation with three examples of responses sent to data subjects who had made access requests. 109. It appears that when a person exercised his right of access, the company transmitted to him the data extracted from the following three tables: - the ""Advertiser\_advent"" table, which stores all the data related to advertiser events; - the ""Banner\_display"" table, which stores all the data necessary to display an advertisement to the user (for example, the country of the user, the data linked to the advertiser or the version of the operation of the user's device); - the ""Click\_cas"" table, which stores all the data related to a user's interactions with advertising banners. 110. The rapporteur considers that the company only partially responded to the requests for right of access referred to it since it did not communicate the data appearing in three other tables: - the ""Usermatching"" table, which contains information allowing Criteo identifiers to be reconciled (in the event that the same user uses several devices) in a ""deterministic"" manner (the company uses information provided by its partners, such as a number loyalty card, an Apple or Android ID, and/or an email address in hashed form to create a link between two Criteo IDs); - the ""bc\_tcp\_timestamp"" table, which contains information allowing the reconciliation of identifiers in a ""probabilistic"" way (the company applies a prediction model from the data linked to two identifiers that it thinks correspond to the same user); - the ""Bid\_request"" table, which contains information related to events relating to the online auction protocol. 111. He also considers that the information provided was not intelligible to the user since the company contented itself with a brief description of the purpose of each table without however providing any explanation of the purpose of each. columns appearing in these tables, nor on their content. 112. The company argues that its procedures in the event of requests made under the right of access comply with the requirements of Article 15 of the GDPR. More specifically, it goes back to each of the three tables listed by the rapporteur and explains why, in the event of an access request, it did not communicate the data they contained. 113. With regard to the ""Usermatching"" table, the company claims that it only contains data allowing the reconciliation of the Criteo identifier with other identifiers, but that it nevertheless undertook to provide this data as part of its responses to access requests from November 2022. 114. With regard to the ""bc\_tcp\_timestamp"" table, the company explains that it is based on a probabilistic method and can potentially reconcile two separate people, so that the communication of data risks infringing the rights and interests of third parties in the event that data relating to another person is communicated to the author of the access request. For this reason, it excluded this table from its responses to access requests. 115. With regard to the ""bid\_request"" table, the company explains that it contains approximately 400 fields relating to bid requests, so that it is essentially technical data and that the remaining data is identical to those appearing in the ""Banner\_display"" table already provided by the company. However, it specifies that it had undertaken to provide all of this data as part of its responses to access requests before March 2023, the time to implement an action plan that would allow it to extract this data by profile. 116. On the intelligibility of the information provided to the persons concerned, it indicates that it has supplemented the explanations with a table listing, for each table, the nature of the data processed, and providing a description and examples of data, which it transmits in responding to access requests. 117. The Restricted Committee takes note of the explanations given by the company for the ""bc\_tcp\_timestamp"" table and indeed considers that the company did not have to communicate the data of this table insofar as they may relate to several people without the company is able to identify with certainty which data relate exclusively to the person making the request. 118. With regard to the ""Usermatching"" and ""bid\_request"" tables, it considers that the elements put forward and produced by the company now allow the user to better understand the information transmitted to him. 119. The Restricted Committee notes, however, that the explanations provided by the company do not justify, on the date of the findings, the non-communication of the data contained in these two tables, whereas it is not disputed that these tables contain personal data which may be combined with other data recorded by the company and, in particular, with the identifier assigned to each Internet user. 120. It adds that it is apparent from those same findings that, in the context of its response to requests for the right of access, the company explained in a succinct sentence the purpose of each table and invited users to send an e-mail to get more information. Thus, in the absence of systematic communication of information on the purpose and content of each of the columns appearing in these tables, the company placed the user in uncertainty as to the nature of the data processed concerning him. 121. It follows from the foregoing that by not communicating all of the personal data of persons exercising their right of access to it and by not automatically providing them with documentation enabling them to understand the data communicated to them, the company has breached its obligations under Articles 12 and 15 of the GDPR. F. On the breach of the obligation to respect the right to withdraw consent and erase data 122. Article 7(3) of the GDPR provides that: “The data subject has the right to withdraw consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent made prior to such withdrawal. The data subject is informed before giving consent. Withdrawing is as easy as giving consent."" 123. Pursuant to Article 17(1) of the GDPR, “The data subject has the right to obtain from the controller the erasure, without undue delay, of personal data concerning him and the data controller processing has the obligation to erase this personal data as soon as possible, when one of the following grounds applies: \[…\] b) the data subject withdraws the consent on which the processing is based pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2) and there is no other legal basis for the processing \[…\] d) the personal data has been unlawfully processed \[…\]"". 124. In the present case, exchanges took place between the CNIL departments and the company following receipt of \[…\]'s complaint concerning his individual situation but also more generally, the procedures put in place by the company to respond to requests to exercise the rights of individuals. The company indicated that it had changed the measures implemented, in particular to make effective the right to withdraw consent and the right to erase data. 125. It appears from the investigations following these exchanges and the deployment of the measures announced by the company that the persons concerned who wished to withdraw their consent to the processing of their data by the company or who exercised their right to erasure could do so by clicking on the ""Disable Criteo services"" button accessible in the company's privacy policy on the ""criteo.com"" website. The company clarified that when a person clicks on this button, an ""opt-out"" cookie is deposited in the person's browser, thus preventing the subsequent deposit of Criteo cookies and the display of personalized advertisements. . 126. The company clarified that the deactivation of Criteo services, i.e. the fact of no longer displaying personalized advertisements to the person, could also be done by using the platforms made available by professional associations. representative of the sector such as the ""YourOnlineChoices"" platform. 127. During the on-site inspection of September 17, 2020, the delegation noted that the company no longer kept track in its databases of the user identifier assigned to \[…\]. During this same check, the company declared that the procedure for deactivating its services no longer allowed it ""to link the user identifier concerned to the user's browser in such a way that no advertising will be proposed to this identifier"", without having the effect of deleting from its tables the identifier of the user at the origin of the request for opposition or deletion. The company added that: ""in the event that a user identifier has been subject to a deactivation procedure, it will no longer be possible to later reconcile the events linked to this identifier with the other possible identifiers linked to this user"". Finally, the company indicated that it could reuse the Criteo user ID as well as the events related to the deactivation request as part of improving its technologies. 128. The rapporteur considers that the company does not meet the requirements of Article 17 of the GDPR since it neither deletes the person's identifier nor deletes the related browsing events and this whereas the processing of \[…\]'s complaint demonstrates that it is indeed capable of effectively erasing the data it processes. 129. The company argues that it is not required to carry out such erasure if it has a legitimate interest in storing and processing the data of persons who have made a request for erasure under the six purposes: sales matching/attribution, fraud prevention/anti-fraud, model training, invoicing, reporting and incident resolution. 130. In this sense, it considers itself justified in not effectively deleting this data as long as the pursuit of these other purposes based on legitimate interest justifies their retention. For each of these six purposes, the company produces a study demonstrating the relevance of using this legal basis. 131. With specific regard to the purpose of training models, the company considers that this allows data subjects to receive even more personalized advertisements, which is also in their interest. It adds that the CNIL has already recognised, in a sanction deliberation no. legitimate interest of a controller. 132. The Restricted Committee notes that when it follows a deletion request, the company limits itself to interrupting the display of personalized advertisements in the terminal of the person making the request, without carrying out a deletion. effective data relating to this person. 133. The Restricted Committee notes that the company claims that it cannot carry out such erasure on the grounds that it needs the data collected as part of its advertising targeting processing, based on consent, to carry out six other purposes which are based, according to the latter, on the legal basis of legitimate interest. 134. However, without it being necessary to rule on the adequacy of the legitimate interest as the legal basis for each of the six purposes put forward by the company, the Restricted Committee considers that, in cases where the company was not in any case unable to ensure that the person making the request had validly consented to the processing of his data by the company, the latter could not continue to process the data of this person for subsequent purposes based on the basis of legitimate interest. However, as demonstrated above, the company did not keep any proof of the valid consent of the persons, in violation of Article 7 of the GDPR. The company could not therefore limit itself to interrupting the display of personalized advertisements and had to proceed to the effective erasure of the data processed. 135. This conclusion is all the more necessary since the investigations show that the company processes a large volume of data for which it has been established that it came from cookies deposited before any manifestation of the Internet user's will and even , in certain cases, when the latter has expressly refused. 136. It follows from the above that by limiting oneself to interrupting the display of personalized advertisements and by not proceeding with the erasure of personal data in the event of exercise of their right to erasure, for persons for whom the company could not ensure the reality of the consent, the company failed in its obligations under articles 7 and 17 of the GDPR. G. On the breach of the obligation to provide for an agreement between joint controllers 137. Article 26 of the GDPR provides that: ""1. The joint controllers shall define in a transparent manner their respective obligations for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the requirements of this Regulation, in particular with regard to the exercise of data processing rights. the data subject, and their respective obligations regarding the communication of the information referred to in Articles 13 and 14, by agreement between them 2. The agreement referred to in paragraph 1 duly reflects the respective roles of the joint controllers and their relations vis-à-vis the persons concerned"". 138. The rapporteur notes that on the date of the findings, the company had indeed entered into a contract with its partners, joint controllers (advertisers, publishers and online auction platforms), which contained a description of the processing objects of joint responsibility and the role of each controller vis-à-vis this processing. 139. He nevertheless emphasizes that this agreement did not make it possible to conclude that the company complied with Article 26 of the GDPR. 140. The company argues that, as drafted, the agreement concluded with its partners did not harm the data subjects who benefited from the full protection of the GDPR since the general conditions of use of its services provide that partners must provide a link to Criteo's privacy policy and allow data subjects to express their consent to targeted advertising. 141. It nevertheless justifies having adopted a new agreement which entered into force on 5 July 2022. 142. The Restricted Committee considers that it follows from the wording of Article 35 of the GDPR that the act allocating the obligations of the joint data controllers must cover all the obligations provided for by the GDPR in order to determine, for each of these obligations, which of the joint controllers will be responsible for them. 143. In this case, the Restricted Committee notes that on the date of the findings, the agreement concluded by the company with its partners did not specify some of the respective obligations of the data controllers with regard to the requirements contained in the GDPR, such as the exercise by the persons concerned of their rights, the obligation to notify a data breach to the supervisory authority and to the persons concerned or, if necessary, the carrying out of a study of impact under Article 35 of the GDPR. 144. It notes that the obligation to conclude an agreement in the event of joint responsibility is a specific obligation imposed on joint controllers under Article 26 of the GDPR. 145. If, in its version of July 5, 2022, the agreement concluded by the company with its partners now includes the information expected under this provision, the Restricted Committee notes that this late compliance does not call into question the characterization of the breach for the past. 146. It follows from the above that the company breached its obligation under Article 26 of the GDPR. III. On the pronouncement of corrective measures and publicity 147. Article 20 of Law No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 as amended provides that: ""when the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or this law, the president of the National Commission for Computing and Liberties may \[…\] seize the restricted formation of the commission with a view to the pronouncement, after adversarial procedure, of one or more of the following measures : \[…\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the annual worldwide turnover total for the previous year, whichever is higher. In the cases mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted committee takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83"". 148. Article 83 of the GDPR, as referred to in Article 20, paragraph III, of the Data Protection Act, provides that: ""Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the administrative fines imposed under the this Article for breaches of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive"", before specifying the elements to be taken into account in deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide on the amount of this fine. A. On the pronouncement of an administrative fine and its amount 149. The company first argues that the CNIL violated the principle of non-discrimination by only taking legal action against it, after having established that the websites of its partners did not comply with the regulations applicable to cookies. 150. It then maintains that it should not be penalized for not having ensured that its partners obtain valid consent other than by contractual means since these checks should in fact fall to the services of the CNIL, which would operate thus a ""privatization"" of its missions. 151. The company considers that better consideration of the criteria provided for in Article 83, paragraph 2, of the GDPR, in particular with regard to the absence of proof of damage, the non-deliberate nature of the breaches, the measures taken to mitigate the damage, of the cooperation which it claims to have shown with the supervisory authority and of the categories of personal data concerned, which are of low intrusiveness, would justify that, in the event that the Restricted Committee decided to impose a fine , it significantly reduces the amount of EUR 60 million proposed by the rapporteur. 152. It argues that the rapporteur's proposed fine represents 50% of its earnings and nearly 3% of its worldwide turnover, which is close to the legal maximum provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR. By comparison, it highlights the previous decisions pronounced by the CNIL against Google (CNIL, FR, December 31, 2021, sanction deliberation no. SAN-2021-023) and Facebook (CNIL, FR, December 31, 2021). 2021, sanction deliberation no. SAN-2021-024) in terms of cookies, the amount of which reached respectively 0.07% and 0.06% of their overall turnover. 153. The Restricted Committee recalls, as a preliminary point, that it is not for the Restricted Committee to assess the decision of the President of the CNIL to initiate proceedings against the company alone. 154. The Restricted Committee recalls that in order to assess whether to impose a fine and determine its amount, it must take into account the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR such as the nature, gravity and duration of the violation, the number of data subjects, the measures taken by the data controller to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority, the categories of personal data affected by the breach and the financial benefits obtained due to the breach. 155. Firstly, with regard to the imposition of an administrative fine, the Restricted Committee considers that it is first appropriate to apply the criterion provided for in subparagraph a) of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the GDPR relating to the seriousness of the breach taking into account the nature, the scope of the processing and the number of data subjects. 156. It recalls first of all that it has been established that the company was unable to demonstrate that the persons concerned had given their consent to the processing of personal data concerning them and that the findings of the delegation of control revealed that the company used browsing data partly from cookies deposited before any manifestation of the Internet user's will. 157. Next, with regard to the scope of the processing, the Restricted Committee observes that the breach is all the more serious since the processing in question, which aims to display personalized advertisements, is carried out on a very large scale and involves, for nature, a massive and intrusive character. 158. It recalls that for the advertisements displayed to be relevant, the company must collect large amounts of data relating to the browsing of Internet users in order to establish a precise image of their consumption habits, their preferences or current concerns. 159. Thus, each visit to the site of an advertiser or publisher, each click on a product or each purchase made by an Internet user is recorded by the company and then analyzed for advertising purposes. As such, the company claims on its website to collect 35 billion events per day related to navigation and purchases in the world. In addition, the company shares and receives data from its partners, in particular to enable it to better identify each Internet user or to establish a link between the different devices and browsers used by the same Internet user. 160. The Restricted Committee notes that, if taken in isolation, each of the data collected by the company has a low identifying value, combined with each other, these are likely to reveal with a high degree of precision many aspects of the privacy of people's lives, including their gender, their age and their consumption habits, that is to say their tastes, thus giving the processing in question a massive and intrusive character. 161. Consequently, the result of the combination of these data considerably reinforces the massive and intrusive nature of the processing in question and makes it all the more necessary that it be implemented in strict compliance with the rules in force, in particularly those surrounding the choice of individuals regarding the use of their data. 162. Similarly, the Restricted Committee recalls that the transformation of raw navigation data into usable information constitutes the company's core business. The latter must therefore all the more be able to ensure that the personal data it processes comply with the regulations in force. 163. With regard to the number of people affected by the processing in question, the Restricted Committee notes that the company announces that it has data relating to around 370 million user identifiers across the European Union, including around 50 million identifiers on French territory alone. While a single person is likely to match multiple IDs, these numbers reveal the substantial amount of data collected by the company. 164. With regard to the breach relating to the information of individuals, the Restricted Committee emphasizes that it has caused Internet users to lose control over their data insofar as the company has not provided them with complete information and understandable. 165. With regard to the breaches relating to the exercise of the rights of access, withdrawal of consent and erasure, the Restricted Committee emphasizes their structural nature and their seriousness in that the measures deployed by the company lead not only to that people's requests are incorrectly processed but also that they legitimately think that their request has been respected. 166. It thus recalls that on the date of the findings, the persons concerned at the origin of an access request were not provided with the data contained in two tables of the company's database. 167. The Restricted Committee also recalls that the sole effect of taking a deletion request into account by the company is to stop the display of personalized advertisements, the company also continuing to store the data of the person at the time. origin of the request and even to use them for other purposes. 168. With regard to the breach relating to the obligation to provide for an agreement between the joint data controllers, the Restricted Committee considers that the fact of not having regulated with more precision the processing carried out jointly with other actors has deprived data subjects of the full protection of their personal data offered by the GDPR. 169. Secondly, the Restricted Committee considers that the criterion provided for in subparagraph k) of Article 83(2) of the GDPR relating to the financial benefits obtained as a result of the breach should be applied. 170. It thus recalls that the company's business model is based exclusively on its ability to display to Internet users the most relevant advertisements to promote the products of its advertiser clients, and therefore on its ability to collect and process an immense amount of data of a personal nature. 171. However, it appears from the present proceedings that this collection and the processing in question are carried out in violation of the requirements of the GDPR and the rights of the persons concerned since the company is accused of not being able to demonstrate that the latter have given their consent to the processing of their data and that it is established, in certain cases, that the company was processing data for which the persons concerned had not consented or had not given valid consent. 172. Thus, the personal data collected and processed without the valid consent of individuals has enabled the company to unduly increase the number of individuals concerned by its processing and therefore its financial income. 173. The Restricted Committee adds that the company has also derived a financial advantage from the fact of not carrying out the erasure of the data by continuing to use the data which is not erased for the purposes of improving its technologies, which contributes to its competitiveness in the targeted advertising market. 174. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that an administrative fine should be imposed for breaches of Articles 7, 12, 13, 15, 17 and 26 of the GDPR. 175. Secondly, with regard to the determination of the amount of the fine, the Restricted Committee recalls that under the provisions of Article 20, paragraph III, of the Data Protection Act and Article 83 of the GDPR, the company incurs, with regard to the breaches mentioned above, a financial penalty of a maximum amount of 20 million euros or 4% of its total worldwide turnover for the previous financial year, which was €1.9 billion in 2022, whichever is higher. 176. Therefore, with regard to the liability of the company, its financial capacity and the relevant criteria of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the Rules mentioned above, the Restricted Committee considers that a fine of forty million euros appears justified. 177. It notes that although this amount constitutes nearly 2% of the company's worldwide turnover, it is nonetheless lower than the legal ceiling of 4% provided for in Article 83, paragraph 5 of the GDPR and in Article 20, paragraph III, 7°) of the Data Protection Act. 178. Furthermore, the Restricted Committee recalls that the amount of the fine may be higher than the profit generated by the data controller, insofar as this would be necessary in order to ensure the dissuasive nature of the sanction (see, in this sens, CE, 1 March 2021, Société Futura Internationale, n° 437808, pt. 6). B. Publicity of the decision 179. The company asks the restricted committee not to make its decision public. 180. The Restricted Committee considers, on the contrary, that the publication of this decision is justified in view of the seriousness of the breaches in question, the scope of the processing and the number of persons concerned. 181. It also notes that this measure will make it possible to inform the persons concerned of the existence of the processing implemented by the company and of the fact that the latter may have processed their data without their knowledge, or even despite their lack of consent. This information will allow them, if necessary, to assert their computer rights and freedoms with the company. 182. Finally, it considers that this measure is proportionate since the decision will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The CNIL Restricted Committee, after having deliberated, decides to: • pronouncing an administrative fine against the company CRITEO SA in the amount of forty million euros (€40,000,000) with regard to the breaches of Articles 7, 12, 13, 15, 17 and 26 of the GDPR ; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer allow the company to be identified by name after a period of two years from its publication. President Alexander LINDEN This decision may be appealed to the Council of State within two months of its notification."

Alain DRU and Bertrand du MARAIS, members; Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 relating to the protection of personal data and the free movement of such data; Having regard to law n° 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended relating to data processing, files and freedoms, in particular its articles 20 et seq.; Having regard to Decree No. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 as amended taken for the application of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 relating to computing, files and freedoms; Having regard to deliberation no. 2013-175 of July 4, 2013 adopting the internal regulations of the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties; Considering deliberation no. SAN-2022-026 of December 29, 2022 adopted by the restricted panel against the company VOODOO; Considering the elements transmitted by the company VOODOO on April 14, 2023 to demonstrate their compliance with the injunction; Considering the other documents in the file; After deliberating at the meeting of July 13, 2023, adopted the following decision: I. FACTS AND PROCEDURE 1. Decision no SAN-2022-026 of December 29, 2022, notified to the company VOODOO on January 16, 2023, ordered the latter to: ""to collect the user's consent to the use of the IDFV for advertising purposes"". 2. This injunction was accompanied by a penalty of twenty thousand euros (20,000) euros per day of delay at the end of a period of three months following notification of the deliberation of the restricted formation, the supporting documents for the in compliance must be sent to the restricted training within this deadline. 3. On April 14, 2023, the VOODOO company sent the president of the restricted training elements with a view to justifying its compliance, by presenting the implementation, during the opening of a game published by the VOODOO company on a terminal equipped with the iOS operating system, a device for collecting consent for the use of the ""identifier for vendors"" (IDFV) for the purposes of targeted advertising, measuring content performance and improvement of its games and applications. 4. It appears from the elements produced by the company that when opening a VOODOO game, the request it presents appears prior to that of the APPLE company (also called ""ATT request""), by which the latter asks the user for permission to track their activities on all applications on their terminal by reading the “identifier for advertisers” (IDFA) for targeted advertising purposes. The company VOODOO specifies that in the event of refusal to use the IDFV, it cannot be read by the partners or by the company itself for advertising purposes, whatever the choice. made by the user at the ATT request. II. REASONS FOR DECISION 5. The restricted training of the CNIL notes that it appears from the information provided by the company that a first window appears when one of the games it publishes is opened, prior to the ATT request. This window requests the user's consent so that the company VOODOO and its partners can collect ""certain technical data, in particular the advertising identifier and the user's IP address"", in order, on the one hand, to ""offer personalized advertisements"" and, on the other hand, to ""measure the performance of content and improve VOODOO games and applications"". 6. This window presents sliding buttons positioned by default on “no consent” for each of these two purposes. 7. The restricted training also notes that a second level of information makes it possible to display the list of recipient partners according to each purpose, to detail the purposes, to inform users of the possibility of withdrawing their consent at any time and to warn them that their refusal will involve access to an “alternative version of the game including a potentially greater volume of non-targeted advertising”. 8. Thus, with regard to the elements presented by the company VOODOO justifying the implementation of a means to collect the user's consent to the use of the IDFV for advertising purposes, the restricted panel considers that the company complied with the injunction within the stipulated time limit. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides: - to say that there is no need to liquidate the penalty; - to make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, this deliberation which will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years, the starting point being the publication of the deliberation no.

The company GROUPE CANAL + having spoken last; The restricted formation adopted the following decision: I. Facts and procedure 1. Founded in 1998 in France, the company GROUPE CANAL + (hereinafter the “company”) specializes in the publishing of channels and the distribution of pay television offers. In 2021, GROUPE CANAL + employed approximately 3,223 employees in France and had achieved, for the year 2022, a turnover of 1,851,312,842 euros. 2. The company offers a publishing service for premium and thematic channels, in the production and distribution of cinema films and television series. It also publishes free channels on digital terrestrial television (DTT). 3. Between November 2019 and January 2021, the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties (hereinafter ""the CNIL"" or ""the Commission"") received 31 complaints, relating in particular to prospecting by telephone, the transmission of banking data and the exercise of rights. Five of these complaints were upheld in this procedure. 4. Pursuant to decision no. 2021-017C of January 21, 2021 of the President of the Commission, a delegation from the CNIL carried out several checks on the company in order to verify compliance with the provisions of law no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter ""the Data Protection Act"" or ""law of January 6, 1978"") and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of Parliament European Union and of the Council of April 27, 2016 relating to the protection of personal data and the free movement of such data (hereinafter the “Regulation” or “GDPR”). 5. Thus, on January 26, 2021, the delegation carried out an online inspection mission of the processing implemented by the company or on its behalf, on the website www.canalplus.com. This inspection gave rise to report no. 2021-017/1, notified the same day to the company. 6. On February 25, 2021, the delegation sent a questionnaire to the company, to which the latter responded on March 26, 2021, relating to its organization, the processing of personal data that it implements, its qualification as data controller, on its relationships with its customers and partners and on its management of requests to exercise rights. 7. From April 2021 to January 2022, the supervisory delegation sent several additional requests to the company, which responded by providing the requested elements. 8. On March 9, 2023, the President of the Commission, on the basis of article 22 of the law of January 6, 1978, appointed Ms. Valérie PEUGEOT as rapporteur for the purposes of examining these elements. 9. On March 30, 2023, the rapporteur sent a supplementary request to which the company responded on April 6, 2023. 10. On May 11, 2023, at the end of her investigation, the rapporteur notified the company of a report detailing the breaches of articles 12, 13, 14, 15, 28, 32 and 33 of the GDPR and article L. 34-5 of the Postal and Electronic Communications Code (hereinafter “the CPCE”) which it considered constituted in this case. 11. On June 12, 2023, the company produced observations in response to the rapporteur's report. 12. By letter dated July 4, 2023, the rapporteur, in application of article 40, III, of decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 taken for the application of the Data Protection Act, informed the company that the investigation was closed. 13. By letter dated July 11, 2023, the company requested that a closed session be declared for the restricted training session. This request was rejected by the president of the restricted formation on July 24, 2023. 14. By email of August 14, 2023, the company communicated additional observations. 15. The rapporteur and the company presented oral observations during the restricted training session of September 14, 2023. 16. \[…\], computer security expert of the company \[…\], service provider of the company GROUPE CANAL +, was heard on the basis of article 22, paragraph 1, of the law of January 6, 1978. II. Reasons for decision A. On the complaints raised by the company in connection with the procedure 17. The company asserts that it was led to produce defense elements which were not requested during the investigation and which nevertheless relate to decisive factual information making it possible to empty of their substance the reasons for certain complaints formulated by the rapporteur. 18. It further considers that the exculpatory elements produced by GROUPE CANAL + were not taken into account, the report being based on samples of information or a very fragmentary perception of the compliance measures taken by the company. 19. Firstly, the restricted training notes that during the inspection mission, the company was able to respond to requests from the CNIL services, produce any supporting documents and share its observations. Each request for additional information subsequently made by the CNIL services was accompanied by a deadline allowing the company to gather the elements it deemed relevant to respond. 20. Secondly, the provisions of Article 40 of Decree No. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019, which provides in particular that the natural or legal person to whom a report proposing a sanction is notified has a deadline of one month to transmit its observations in response, were respected. 21. In view of these elements, the restricted panel considers that the procedure is not tainted by irregularity. B. On the failure to comply with the obligation to obtain the consent of the persons concerned for the implementation of commercial prospecting by electronic means 22. Under the terms of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, ""direct prospecting by means of an automated electronic communications system \[…\], a fax machine or electronic mail using the contact details of a natural person \[…\] who has not previously expressed their consent to receive direct marketing by this means. For the application of this article, consent means any manifestation of free, specific and informed will by which a person accepts that personal data concerning him or her be used for direct marketing purposes. \[…\] "". 23. Article 4(11) of the GDPR provides that “consent” of the data subject means “any free, specific, informed and unambiguous manifestation of will by which the data subject accepts, by a declaration or by a clear positive act, that personal data concerning them are subject to processing"". 24. Article 7(1) of the GDPR provides that ""in cases where processing is based on consent, the controller is able to demonstrate that the data subject has given consent to the processing of data to personal character concerning her. 25. To propose to the restricted panel to consider that the company has failed to comply with its obligations resulting from articles L. 34-5 of the CPCE and 7, paragraph 1, of the GDPR, as clarified by the provisions of article 4 , paragraph 11, of the GDPR, the rapporteur relies on the fact that the company GROUPE CANAL +, which has electronic commercial prospecting operations carried out on its behalf by service providers, is not able to have and provide the proof of consent validly expressed by prospects to be canvassed in this way. Indeed, the data from these prospects comes from suppliers \[…\] (hereinafter “\[…\]”), in this case \[…\]. However, the rapporteur notes that these prospects, by checking the box provided on the collection forms to give their consent to receive commercial prospecting electronically, have not validly consented to receiving prospecting from the company GROUPE CANAL +, to the extent that they have not been informed of the identity of this prospector on whose behalf the consent would be collected, the information not being available on the collection forms or via a link Clickable URL. 26. In defense, the company maintains that the responsibility for obtaining the lawful consent of the prospects concerned does not fall on it but on the \[…\] who are at the origin of the data collection and with whom it has concluded contracts distributing the responsibilities of each party. She adds that these \[…\] are responsible for sharing their customers’ data. She also considers that the report does not specify the legal basis which would establish its own obligation to collect this consent. The company also affirms that the applicable regulations do not require information from individuals on the identity of the recipients of their data for consent to be considered validly collected. It concludes that in view of these elements, the report disregards the principles of legality of offenses and penalties and the principle of personal responsibility. 27. First of all, the restricted panel recalls that, in application of the combined provisions of articles L. 34-5 of the CPCE and 7, paragraph 1, of the GDPR, as clarified by article 4, paragraph 11, of the GDPR, the organization – in this case the company GROUPE CANAL + – which carries out commercial prospecting operations electronically using data collected by its partners, must have consent constituting a “manifestation of will, free, specific, informed and unambiguous” of the persons concerned. When prospects' data has not been collected directly from them by the prospecting organization, consent may have been obtained at the time of initial data collection by the first-time collector, on behalf of of the organization which will carry out subsequent prospecting operations. Failing this, it is up to the prospecting organization to obtain such consent before carrying out prospecting acts. Pursuant to the provisions of Article 7(1) of the GDPR, the prospector must then be able to prove that he has this consent. In addition, for consent to be informed, individuals must be clearly informed of the identity of the prospector on whose behalf the consent is collected and the purposes for which the data will be used. To do this, in the event of consent collected by the first-time collector on behalf of prospectors, an exhaustive and updated list is made available to people at the time of obtaining their consent, for example directly on the collection medium. or, if this is too long, via a hypertext link to the said list and the confidentiality policies of service providers and suppliers (see to this effect, CNIL, FR, November 24, 2022, SANCTION, n° SAN-2022 -021, published). 28. In the present case, the restricted panel notes that 3,346,632 prospects whose data were collected from \[…\] and 588,324 from \[…\] were the subject of prospecting by electronic means during the year 2021 by the service provider acting on behalf of the company GROUPE CANAL +. For all of these prospects, the company is not able to provide documents demonstrating the obtaining of consent validly collected from individuals, whether by itself – which it has specified that it does not do – or by first-time collectors. 29. Indeed, if the company provided the control delegation with examples of standard forms for collecting data from prospects made available by \[…\], the restricted training notes that no list of partners – including GROUPE CANAL + – which must be made available to prospects at the time of consent, has not been communicated as part of the procedure. For the company \[…\], the collection form provides a check box with the following statement: “accept to receive commercial information for services/products \[…\] and partners”. For the company \[…\], the notice specifies: “accept to receive commercial information from the companies of \[…\] or their partners according to my interests or the location where I am”. In both cases, no information on the identity of the partners concerned is available on the collection form or via a clickable hyperlink. 30. Thus, the company GROUPE CANAL + has not established that it has valid consent from individuals for its commercial prospecting operations by electronic means. Indeed, if the people have indeed given their consent to the companies \[...\] to receive electronic commercial prospecting by checking the boxes present for this purpose on the forms in question, they have not validly consented to receiving electronic commercial prospecting. prospecting by the company GROUPE CANAL +, to the extent that they have not been informed of the identity of this prospector on whose behalf the consent would be collected. The consent obtained cannot be considered as informed, as the persons concerned are not informed of the identity of the prospector on whose behalf the consent is collected, namely the company GROUPE CANAL +. In the absence of this information, consent cannot be considered valid. 31. Secondly, the company argues that the prospects' data would not be transmitted directly to it, but to service providers, and that the company would therefore not be the recipient of the electronic mail addresses of customers of \[…\], which are not in its database. The restricted panel considers that the circumstance according to which the company uses service providers to carry out prospecting operations has no impact on the fact that, in order to be able to rely on valid consent obtained by the first-time collector, the company GROUPE CANAL + must appear in the list of partners to whom the data is transmitted, as long as these subcontracting service providers act on its behalf. The company is responsible for the commercial prospecting it carries out, including when it is carried out on its behalf by a subcontractor. 32. Thirdly, the restricted panel notes that, as part of the documentary inspection, the company indicated that \[…\] are responsible for collecting the consent of the persons concerned. The company specified that it does not exercise any control over the consent collection forms used, indicating that “these forms are managed solely by the \[…\] concerned, in \[their\] capacity as data controller. Consequently, Canal+ Group is not responsible for defining the terms and conditions for collecting consent from \[…\] subscribers. 33. The restricted panel therefore considers that the measures put in place by the company GROUPE CANAL + to ensure with its partners that consent had been validly given by prospects before approaching them were insufficient. 34. Under these conditions, the restricted panel considers that the company has failed to comply with its obligations resulting from articles L. 34-5 of the CPCE and 7, paragraph 1, of the GDPR, as clarified by the provisions of article 4 , paragraph 11, of the GDPR. C. On breaches relating to the obligation to inform the persons concerned of the processing of their personal data 1) Regarding the information provided to users when creating an account for the MyCanal service 35. Article 12(1) of the GDPR provides that ""the data controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 as well as to carry out any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and of Article 34 with regard to the processing of the data subject in a concise, transparent, understandable and easily accessible manner (…)"". 36. Article 13, paragraph 1, of the GDPR requires the data controller to provide the data subject with various information relating in particular to their identity and contact details, the purposes of the processing implemented, its legal basis, the recipients or categories of data recipients and whether the controller intends to transfer data to a third country. 37. Article 13(2) of the GDPR provides that, where this appears necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing of data, the data controller must provide the person with ""the retention period of the personal data or, when this is not possible, the criteria used to determine this duration"" and information relating to the ""right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority"". 38. The guidelines on transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, clarifying the aforementioned provisions, specify that: “the retention period \[…\] should be formulated in such a way that the person concerned can assess, depending on the situation in which it finds itself, what the retention period will be in the case of specific data or in the case of specific purposes. The data controller cannot simply declare in general that data of a nature personal data will be kept for as long as the legitimate purpose of the processing requires it. Where applicable, different storage periods should be mentioned for different categories of personal data and/or different purposes of processing, in particular periods for archival purposes.” 39. In this case, the rapporteur notes that when creating an account on the MyCanal service, a link located under the data collection form takes the user to a page entitled ""Personal data and confidentiality"". She considers that the company's confidentiality policy does not specify the retention periods of data in a sufficiently precise manner. It notes in fact that this is limited to indicating that ""your personal data are kept for periods determined with regard to our purposes and the legal, tax and accounting obligations incumbent on us. The data linked to your subscription makes the subject to electronic archiving for the entire subscription period and during the legal limitation periods. Furthermore, the rapporteur observes that the possibility of submitting a complaint to the CNIL is not mentioned in the confidentiality policy. 40. The company argues, on the one hand, that if the GDPR does require informing the persons concerned about the retention period of their data, neither the GDPR nor the G29 transparency guidelines contain an indication as to the degree of granularity expected for the provision of this information. The choice made by the company allows it to be transparent without excessively burdening its confidentiality policy. 41. However, it specifies that it modified its confidentiality policy on February 6, 2023 to provide more precise and granular information. 42. On the other hand, with regard to the information relating to the possibility of lodging a complaint with the CNIL, the company acknowledges that it did not appear in the confidentiality policy at the time of the check but that it was added during the redesign. She specifies that the information was, however, provided in the general conditions of use, available from the website, and in the general subscription conditions provided with each subscription to a service. 43. Firstly, with regard to the duration of data retention, the restricted panel notes that the document, dated December 3, 2020, is not precise enough in that it is limited to stating that the duration of Conservation of data is linked to the pursuit of certain purposes (compliance with legal, accounting, tax obligations) or to the duration of the subscription, without indicating the precise durations applicable. The retention periods are stated generically and are not sufficiently explicit, with the restricted training also noting that some users of the service are not subscribers but have only created a personal space on the site. 44. However, the restricted panel considers that this information is important to guarantee “fair and transparent processing” since it helps to ensure that users have control over the processing of their data. 45. In view of the above, the restricted panel considers that the information relating to the retention period of user data is not sufficiently detailed, which constitutes a breach of Article 13 of the GDPR. 46. The restricted committee notes, however, that the retention periods indicated in the confidentiality policy modified on February 6, 2023 are in accordance with the recommendations of the CNIL. 47. Secondly, the restricted panel notes that there is no mention of the right to lodge a complaint with the CNIL in the company's confidentiality policy although this information is expressly referred to in Article 13. , paragraph 2, d), of the GDPR. 48. However, it notes that the compilation of several documents, accessible from the website, makes it possible to obtain the information, which is therefore not missing, even if it is not easily accessible. This last complaint, however, falling under Article 12 of the GDPR, was not raised by the rapporteur in her sanction report. 49. Under these conditions, the restricted panel considers that the breach of Article 13 of the GDPR, with regard to information relating to the possibility of lodging a complaint with the CNIL, is not constituted. 50. Furthermore, the restricted panel notes that the company has modified its confidentiality policy, accessible from the collection form, which is now complete. 51. The restricted panel notes that during the procedure, the company modified its confidentiality policy to mention the right to lodge a complaint with the CNIL. 2) Concerning the information provided to prospects during telephone canvassing calls 52. Article 14 of the GDPR specifies the information to be provided when personal data has not been collected from the data subject. This article provides that the same elements of information as those referred to in Article 13 of the GDPR must be provided to the data subject, as well as the categories of personal data collected and, if this is necessary to guarantee fair and transparent treatment, other elements including the source from which this data comes. 53. Article 14 of the GDPR also specifies that the information must be communicated to the data subject ""within a reasonable period after obtaining the personal data, but not exceeding one month, having regard to the particular circumstances in which the personal data are processed” or “if the personal data are to be used for the purposes of communication with the data subject, at the latest at the time of the first communication to that person”. 54. In this case, the rapporteur notes that, as part of the inspection, the company provided the CNIL delegation with a sample consisting of seventy recordings of telephone calls made by a subcontractor in the framework of prospecting campaigns carried out using data obtained through its partners. 55. It notes that listening to these recordings revealed that sixteen people approached by telephone on behalf of the company did not benefit from complete information provided under the conditions provided for by the Article 14 cited above and, for four other people, no information was provided. 56. In defense, the company indicates that, with regard to the sixteen calls for which the information is incomplete, the information is complete in three cases. For six calls, she claims that the telephone advisor did not have time to provide this information because the prospect hung up too quickly. In one case, the call concerned a person who had already subscribed, who had therefore already received this information on several occasions. For the last six cases, the company recognizes that the prospect did not have all the required information, but that it puts in place specific procedures aimed at ensuring that these situations do not occur. 57. Regarding the four calls for which no information was provided, the company notes that these are very short calls, for which the telephone advisor was not able to provide this information. 58. The company indicates, in general, that these cases represent only a minority in relation to the number of calls made. 59. The restricted training recalls that it follows from Article 14 of the GDPR that, when a prospector obtains a telephone number from a third party for the purposes of prospecting by telephone, he must inform the prospected person of the processing of these data for this purpose, at the latest during the telephone call. When information provided for by the GDPR is provided in the context of telephone exchanges, it is accepted that this information may be limited to the most important elements for the interlocutor, in order to remain brief, provided that a means of communication is indicated. 'obtain complete information (examples: button to activate on the telephone, email received by the interlocutor, referral to a web page) (see to this effect, CNIL, FR, June 23, 2022, SANC-TION, no. SAN- 2022-011, published). Information on the processing of data transmitted by \[…\], in particular the telephone contact details of individuals, for telephone prospecting purposes, in application of Article 14 of the GDPR, and that relating to the registration of the conversation, in application of article 13 of the GDPR, can also be merged. 60. The restricted panel notes that the company provided the CNIL supervisory delegation with a sample of call recordings made as part of the prospecting campaigns and specified that the recordings were made randomly. The company also clarified to the delegation that the people called are in principle informed, at the very beginning of the call, of their discretionary right to oppose the recording, in accordance with the instructions received by the ""advisors internal and external calls"". However, in all the cases covered by the report (incomplete information or absence of information), the restricted training notes that the teleadvisor had started the discussion on the offers proposed by GROUPE CANAL +. So, even if the call was brief, the telephone advisor had initiated a prospecting process. 61. The restricted panel further observes that, in certain cases, the people contacted for prospecting purposes did not benefit from any information. In other cases, certain points provided for in Article 14 of the GDPR – such as the purposes of the processing or the existence of different rights – have not been brought to their attention, and the company does not has not put in place a method allowing data subjects to obtain more complete information relating to the processing of their data, for example via the activation of a key on the telephone keypad. However, the restricted training notes that all calls referred to by the rapporteur last at least thirty seconds, and that the telephone advisor would therefore have had time to proceed, for example, to a referral to the confidentiality policy of GROUPE CANAL +. 62. Finally, the restricted panel considers that if the recordings communicated to the CNIL do not reveal the existence of a structural failure in terms of information, the fact remains that it disregarded its obligations within the framework of the above-mentioned calls. 63. Under these conditions, the restricted panel considers that the breach of Article 14 of the GDPR has been established. D. On the breach of obligations relating to the modalities of exercise of the rights of individuals 64. Under Article 12(3) of the GDPR, ""the controller shall provide the data subject with information on the measures taken following a request made pursuant to Articles 15 to 22, in the as soon as possible and in any case within one month of receipt of the request. If necessary, this period may be extended by two months, taking into account the complexity and number of requests. The person responsible for processing informs the data subject of this extension and the reasons for the postponement within one month of receipt of the request. Where the data subject submits their request in electronic form, the information is provided electronically where possible, unless the person concerned requests otherwise.” 65. Under the terms of Article 12, paragraph 4, of the GDPR, ""If the data controller does not respond to the request made by the data subject, he shall inform the data subject without delay and at the latest within a period of 'one month from receipt of the request for reasons for inaction and the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and filing a legal appeal.' 66. The rapporteur, to propose to the restricted panel to consider that the company has failed to comply with its obligations resulting from Article 12 of the GDPR, relies on the referrals from three complainants, Mr \[…\] (referral no \[…\] ) and Ms \[…\] (referral no \[…\]) and \[…\] (referral no \[…\]). The first two report difficulties encountered in erasing their personal data, the third concerns a request for opposition. 67. The rapporteur observes that it appears from the findings made during the control procedure that these requests were processed by the company but without the persons concerned being informed of the action taken on their request. Furthermore, regarding the opposition request, it was processed by the company outside the deadlines provided for by the GDPR. 68. In defense, with regard to the two erasure requests, the company indicates that these concerned, each time, a request for termination and a request for erasure. Due to an error in qualifying the request, the erasure was processed but the person concerned was not notified. The company argues that these are isolated cases and that the erasure request was processed. 69. Regarding the opposition request, the company considers that the complainant's initial request was not identified as such by customer service. But as part of the documentary check, the company became aware of the existence of the complaint and contacted the complainant. The request was ultimately identified as a request to object to commercial solicitations, a request which was processed the same day. 70. The restricted panel first notes that the requests made by the complainants to the company were clear, in that they aimed at a request for ""deletion"" or a request for ""opposition"" and that they were addressed directly to the company's data protection officer. 71. Next, the restricted committee observes that under Article 12(3) of the GDPR, the data controller must in principle provide data subjects with information on the measures taken following a request in a maximum period of one month. However, on the day of the documentary inspection, carried out on February 25, 2021, i.e. well over a month after the initial requests – sent respectively on October 30, 2019 and December 17, 2020 – the company had not informed the people concerned about the follow-up given, which she does not dispute. 72. Finally, the restricted panel considers that if the referrals received by the CNIL do not reveal the existence of a structural failure in terms of the exercise of rights, as the company emphasizes, the fact remains that it -he disregarded his obligations in processing the requests sent to him. 73. Under these conditions, the restricted panel considers that the breach of Article 12 of the GDPR has been established. E. On the failure in terms of the right of access of the persons concerned 74. Article 15(1) of the GDPR provides for the right of an individual to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed and, where they are, to access to said personal data as well as certain information, in particular ""when the personal data are not collected from the person concerned, any information available as to their source"". It is also provided in paragraph 3 of the same article that ""the controller provides a copy of the personal data subject to processing"". 75. The rapporteur, to propose to the panel to consider that the company has failed to comply with its obligations resulting from Article 15 of the GDPR, relies on three referrals to the CNIL, emanating from MM. \[…\] (n° \[…\]) and \[…\] (n° \[…\]) and Ms \[…\] (n° \[…\]), these people reporting the lack of response from the company to their requests . 76. The company acknowledges an error or malfunction in the qualification of the subject of the request with regard to referral no. \[…\] and claims to have never received the request relating to referral no. \[…\]. 77. On the other hand, with regard to referral no. \[…\], the company considers that the complainant's request was not precisely formulated as a request for access to her personal data. She considers that this was a request for proof of a subscription contract, which does not fall under the GDPR. 78. The restricted panel first notes that it appears from the elements of the file that the complainants' requests were all received by the company. 79. Next, it considers that the requests were formulated in sufficiently clear terms. Regarding referral no. \[…\], the complainant asked the company to ""send to her the elements available to you as soon as possible, or failing that, to cancel this current contract and also to proceed with the deletion of personal data \[…\] in accordance with the provisions of article 17.1 of the General Regulations on the protection of personal data"". The complainant thus explicitly expressed the wish to obtain the transmission of the elements available to the company. This should have led the company to treat the request as a request for access and then erasure. 80. Finally, the restricted panel considers that if the referrals received by the CNIL do not reveal the existence of a structural failure in terms of exercising the right of access, the fact remains that the company has failed to recognize its obligations in processing requests sent to it. 81. Under these conditions, the restricted panel considers that the breach of Article 15 of the GDPR has been established. F. On the failure to comply with the obligation to regulate by a formalized legal act the processing carried out on behalf of a data controller 82. Article 28(3) of the Regulation provides that processing carried out by a processor on behalf of a data controller is governed by a contract or any other formalized legal act which defines the purpose and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data, the categories of data subjects as well as the obligations and rights of the data controller. This contract also provides for the conditions under which the subcontractor undertakes to carry out processing operations on behalf of the controller. 83. The rapporteur noted that several subcontracting contracts relating to the hosting of personal data, communicated by the company, did not contain all the notices provided for by the aforementioned article. It notes that contracts with \[…\] were concluded before the entry into force of the GDPR and have not since been updated to include the information provided for in Article 28, paragraph 3, of the Regulations. 84. In defense, the company claims that it terminated the hosting services provided by \[…\] from 2016, i.e. before the entry into force of the GDPR. This service having been transferred to another subcontractor, the contract has not been updated. Regarding the contract with \[…\], the company affirms that amendments have been signed until 2022 and that these amendments are supplemented by contracts relating to the processing of personal data containing all the information prescribed by the GDPR. The contractual relationship with \[…\] ended on June 27, 2023. Regarding the contract with \[…\], the company indicates that the contract contains several documents, including one which was not communicated to the CNIL during the inspection on parts. The combination of these documents would show that the notices provided for by the GDPR indeed govern the contractual relationship between the two actors. Following the acquisition of \[…\] by the company \[…\], a new contractual framework including a “Data Processing” appendix is also currently being discussed. 85. The restricted panel notes that numerous elements were communicated by the company as part of the sanction procedure, after notification of the report. 86. In light of these elements, it appears that with regard to the contract governing relations with \[…\], these ended in 2016, before the entry into force of the GDPR, so that the breach does not is not constituted 87. Then regarding the acts governing relations with the company \[…\], with regard to the original contract concluded with \[…\] which was communicated in response to the sanction report, and which supplements that communicated by GROUPE CANAL + during checks, the restricted training notes that all of the information required by Article 28 of the GDPR appears in the contracts when the two documents are read together. The breach is therefore not constituted for the supervision of these relationships. 88. Finally, regarding the contract concluded with \[…\], the amendments to the contract were not communicated to the CNIL services as part of the control procedure, which the company acknowledges. During the documentary inspection on February 25, 2021, the company provided the CNIL delegation with a contract dating from 2019, concluded for a period of one year, which did not include all of the information required under the Article 28(3) of the GDPR. It subsequently provided, in response to the sanction report, amendments which would have been concluded at the expiration of this contract, and which would have been renewed since. The restricted training notes that these new documents now contain all the necessary information. However, it observes that these documents provided are not signed and appear to be working versions (some include a note highlighted in yellow indicating ""\[...\] Cloud Service Agreement for INSERT DESCRIP-TION OT THE SYSTEM"" and ""contract number"" without the contract number). In addition, the only date indicated is a ""revised"" version of March 4, 2022. These observations on the form of the documents provided in defense having been raised, the restricted panel considers, in any event, that it is not necessary to determine whether the amendments provided constitute admissible supporting evidence to the extent that the breach is indeed established for past facts, in view of the findings made by the delegation at the time of the inspection. 89. Under these conditions, the restricted panel considers that the breach of Article 28, paragraph 3, of the GDPR is constituted for the past facts concerning the contract governing relations with \[…\]. G. On the breach of the security obligation 90. Article 32(1) of the GDPR provides that “Taking into account the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks , the degree of probability and severity of which varies, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee a level of security adapted to the risk \[…\] "" and in particular "" means to guarantee the constant confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services "" and a "" procedure aimed at testing, analyzing and evaluating regularly the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing"". 91. The rapporteur considers that the storage of the passwords of the company's employees in the application \[…\] in hashed form using the MD4 algorithm does not comply with the state of the art. 92. In defense, the company notes that the insufficiency of security measures referred to in the sanction report has not been established. She states that the report is based on short answers given to targeted questions formulated during the control, which were not intended to allow the CNIL to be fully informed of the overall level of security surrounding the passwords processed by the Company. It thus highlights other measures that would be put in place by the company and which would ensure an appropriate level of security, such as for example permanent monitoring of activity within the computer network or a limited number of administered accounts. -trators. It also specifies that a migration policy towards a new version of Windows Server encouraged it to evolve the algorithms used towards more robust versions, with a migration completed in February 2023. Since then, the algorithm chain \[ …\] is used. 93. The company further considers that the rapporteur wrongly relies on deliberation no. 2022-100 of July 21, 2022 adopting a recommendation relating to passwords and other shared secrets and repealing deliberation no. 2017 -012 of January 19, 2017, which does not have a normative character, is subsequent to the control and admits the implementation of supplementary devices to passwords only. Its violation could therefore not be punishable. 94. The restricted training recalls that it follows from the provisions of Article 32 of the GDPR that the data controller is required to ensure that the automated data processing that it implements is sufficiently secure. The sufficiency of security measures is assessed, on the one hand, with regard to the characteristics of the processing and the risks it induces, and on the other hand, taking into account the state of knowledge and the cost of the measures. 95. Implementing a robust authentication policy constitutes a basic security measure which generally contributes to compliance with the obligations of Article 32 of the GDPR. Thus, in terms of authentication, it is necessary to ensure that a password allowing authentication to a system cannot be disclosed. Keeping passwords secure is a basic precaution when it comes to protecting personal data. As early as 2013, the National Information Systems Security Agency (ANS-SI) warned and recalled good practices regarding the retention of passwords, indicating that they must ""be stored in a form transformed by a one-way cryptographic function (hash function) and slow to calculate such as PBKDF2"" and that ""the transformation of passwords must involve a random salt to prevent an attack by precalculated tables"" (ANSSI, ""Bulletin d' news CERTA-2013-ACT-046"", November 15, 2013, https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/actualite/CERTA-2013-ACT-046/). Likewise, in its deliberation no. 2017-012 of January 19, 2017 adopting a recommendation relating to passwords, the CNIL already indicated that it ""recommends \[that the password\] be transformed by means of 'a non-reversible and secure cryptographic function (i.e. using a public algorithm deemed strong whose software implementation is free of known vulnerabilities), integrating the use of a salt or a key.' Indeed, non-robust hash functions present known vulnerabilities which do not guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of passwords in the event of a brute force attack after compromise of the servers which host them. 96. However, the restricted training notes that the MD4 algorithm, used by the company for storing employee passwords at the time of checks, was already deemed obsolete and insufficiently robust to ensure the confidentiality of passwords. the date of the findings made by the delegation. Indeed, the MD4 hashing function is the subject of a vulnerability known for several years and immediately exploitable by attackers (presenting a risk of collision) (See in this sense ANSSI, ""CERTFR-2014-ACT News Bulletin -028"", July 11, 2014, https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/actualite/CERTFR-2014-ACT-028/). If the company argued that the positions taken by ANSSI in 2014 documents have since been replaced by other more recent documents, the fact remains that a hash function which was no longer the state of the art in 2014 was no more so on the day of the controls. The use of the MD4 algorithm requires the use of the NTLM protocol for authentication, while this protocol was already criticized by the ANSSI at the time of the controls (See in this sense ANSSI, ""Recommendations for the protection essential information systems"", December 18, 2020, https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2020/12/guide\_protection\_des\_systemes\_essentiels.pdf). The use of this hash function therefore does not guarantee the security of the personal data concerned. The restricted training further considers that the robustness of peripheral security measures is not sufficient to compensate for the use of the MD4 algorithm. Indeed, the inherent fragility of the hash function used, on which the security of the password storage of the company's employees is based, is such that it cannot be rectified by other measures. 97. Under these conditions, the restricted panel considers that the breach of Article 32 of the GDPR has been established. 98. The restricted panel notes that, since February 2023, the company has been using a new version of Windows Server which uses an algorithm consistent with the state of the art. H. On the failure to notify the CNIL of a personal data breach 99. Article 4.12 of the GDPR defines a personal data breach as “a breach of security resulting, accidentally or unlawfully, in the destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or unauthorized access to such data. 100. Article 33 of the GDPR provides that ""in the event of a personal data breach, the data controller shall notify the breach in question to the competent supervisory authority in accordance with Article 55, as soon as possible and, if possible, no later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the violation in question is not likely to create a risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. When notification to the supervisory authority does not take place within 72 hours, it is accompanied by the reasons for the delay (…) If, and to the extent that, it is not possible to provide all the information at the same time, the information may be communicated in a staggered manner without further undue delay"". 101. Recital 87 of the GDPR specifies that ""it should be verified whether all appropriate technical and organizational protection measures have been implemented to immediately establish whether a personal data breach has occurred and to promptly inform the ""supervisory authority and the data subject"". 102. In the Guidelines on personal data breach notification of 6 February 2018, the European Data Protection Board (EDPS) considers, by way of illustration, ""that a controller should be considered as having become “aware” \[of the personal data breach\] when it is reasonably certain that a security incident has occurred and that this incident has compromised personal data. The GDPR requires the controller to implement all appropriate technical and organizational protection measures to immediately establish whether a personal data breach has occurred and to promptly inform the supervisory authority and the authorities. persons concerned (…). The data controller is therefore required to take the necessary measures to ensure that he becomes “aware” of any violation as soon as possible in order to be able to react appropriately. 103. The EDPS provides the following example: ""a third party informs a data controller that it has accidentally received the personal data of one of its clients and provides proof of this unauthorized disclosure. Since the controller has received clear evidence attesting to a breach of confidentiality, there is no doubt that he was 'aware' of it. 104. The rapporteur notes that the company was informed by subscribers, on February 5, 2020, of a data breach. Following an update to the CANAL + customer area, subscribers accessing their account were able to view information relating to other subscribers. Despite the number of people concerned and the type of data made accessible, the rapporteur notes that the company did not notify the CNIL of this data breach. The rapporteur considers that by not making this notification, the company failed to comply with the provisions of Article 33 of the GDPR. 105. In defense, the company indicates that it would have followed the EDPS guidelines and the recommendations of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) to conclude that she did not have to notify the violation. On the basis of these texts, it considers that given the insensitive nature of the data concerned and the small number of people potentially impacted, it was not required to make a notification. She argues in particular that the temporary loss of confidentiality, which allowed seven people to view the data of other customers, lasted only 5 hours 35 minutes. She adds that the data concerned is not sensitive and that the people who were able to view it are other subscribers, without malicious intent and without particular expertise allowing them to extract the accessible data. It also specifies that the precise number of people who may have had access to the data of 10,154 subscribers is unknown. However, it would be limited to a maximum of 777 people, who were, according to the company, technically capable of having access. 106. The restricted panel firstly notes that the number of people affected by the violation, 10,154, is not negligible. She notes that several people have indicated to the company that they actually had access to third-party data. The restricted panel then notes that the personal data made accessible by the violation were of a nature that could infringe the right to respect for the private life of subscribers since their postal address and telephone number had been disclosed. Consequently, the company should have notified the CNIL of a personal data breach. 107. Under these conditions, the restricted panel considers that the breach of Article 33 of the GDPR has been established. III. On the issuance of corrective measures and publicity 108. Article 20 of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended provides that: ""when the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27 2016 or this law, the president of the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties may \[…\] refer the matter to the restricted formation of the commission with a view to pronouncing, after adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures : \[…\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the figure d total global annual business of the previous financial year, the highest amount being retained. In the hypotheses mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these The ceilings are increased, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted training takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83. 109. Article 83 of the GDPR, as referred to in Article 20, paragraph III, of the Data Protection Act, provides that: “Each supervisory authority ensures that the administrative fines imposed in under this Article for breaches of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive"", before specifying the elements to be taken into account in deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide the amount of this fine. 110. Firstly, on the principle of issuing a sanction, the company indicates that in addition to the fact that it contests the failings alleged by the rapporteur or justifies them, it has already taken measures to remedy to some of the alleged facts and ensure its compliance with applicable legislation. She adds that some of the complaints made to her by the rapporteur are made with regard to recommendations and a framework of the CNIL which do not have mandatory value, and which moreover postdate the facts in question. It further emphasizes that several of the alleged breaches are not substantial in this case and that they represented a limited or even non-existent impact on the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned. Finally, she emphasizes the good will and efforts she demonstrated throughout the procedure. The company considers that the mitigation factors provided for in Article 83, paragraph 2, of the GDPR should lead the restricted body not to impose a financial sanction, or at the very least, to very significantly reduce the amount of the fine. proposed by the rapporteur. 111. The restricted committee recalls that it must take into account, when issuing an administrative fine, the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, seriousness and duration of the violation, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and the categories of personal data affected by the breach. 112. The restricted training underlines that the breaches committed by the company relate, for some, to obligations relating to the fundamental principles of the protection of personal data and that numerous breaches are made. It notes that some of these breaches are structural and of certain seriousness, others are less serious. 113. Thus, with regard more particularly to the collection of consent for prospecting purposes by electronic means, the restricted training recalls that the company processes a significant number of data for commercial prospecting purposes. It appears from the information communicated by the company that 3,934,956 prospects were canvassed electronically in 2021. 114. The restricted training takes into consideration, as mitigating factors, the measures taken by the company, which has complied on certain points, as well as the low seriousness of certain breaches, in particular the fact that appeals canvassing for which the lack of information is retained only concerns a small part of the people canvassed. The restricted panel further notes, with regard to the referrals made during the debates, that the breaches of people's rights are not structural and mainly result from human errors. Finally, it notes the isolated nature of the contract for which the supporting documents do not allow us to conclude that it complies with the requirements of the GDPR. 115. In view of all these elements, the restricted panel considers that it is appropriate to impose an administrative fine for the breaches of Articles 7, paragraph 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 28, 32 and 33 of the GDPR and article L. 34-5 of the CPCE. 116. Secondly, the restricted panel recalls that the violations of the GDPR noted in this case involve breaches of principles likely to be subject, under Article 83 of the GDPR, to an administrative fine which may be Raise up to 20,000,000 euros or up to 4% of the global annual turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher. 117. It also recalls that administrative fines must be both dissuasive and proportionate. It considers in particular that the activity of the company and its financial situation must be taken into account in determining the amount of the administrative fine. It notes in this regard that the company GROUPE CANAL + achieved a turnover of 1,851,312,842 euros in 2022. 118. Therefore, with regard to the liability of the company, its financial capacities and the relevant criteria of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the GDPR mentioned above, the restricted panel estimates that a fine of 600,000 euros appears justified. 119. Thirdly, with regard to the publicity of the sanction, the company asks the restricted panel not to make its decision public. 120. The restricted panel considers, on the contrary, that the publicity of this decision is justified in view of the seriousness of some of the breaches in question, the scope of the processing and the number of people concerned. 121. It also notes that this measure will make it possible to inform the people concerned by the company's prospecting operations. This information will allow them, if necessary, to assert their rights with the company. 122. Finally, it considers that this measure is proportionate since the decision will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: • impose an administrative fine against the company GROUPE CANAL + in the amount of six hundred thousand euros (€600,000) for breaches of articles 7, paragraph 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 28, 32 and 33 of the GDPR and article L. 34-5 of the postal and electronic communications code; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer allow the company to be identified by name after a period of two years from its publication. President Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be the subject of an appeal before the Council of State within two months of its notification."

The representatives of the Ministries of Transformation and Public Service and of Economy, Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty having spoken last; The restricted formation adopted the following decision: I. Facts and procedure 1. The National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties (hereinafter “the CNIL” or “the Commission”) has received 1,590 complaints relating to the receipt on January 26, 2023 of an email sent by the electronic address “ne-pas-repondre@dgfip.finances.gouv.fr” and whose subject was “Pension reform: Message from Stanislas Guerini to civil service agents”. The email contained a link to a video lasting 6 minutes and 36 seconds entitled ""Pension reform: Message from Stanislas Guerini to civil service agents"" in which the Minister of Transformation and Public Service spoke . 2. The complaints targeted the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty (hereinafter “Ministry of the Economy”) and the Ministry of Transformation and Public Service. Generally speaking, the complainants describe the email they received as a ""political communication"", and the use, by the Directorate General of Public Finances (DGFiP), of their personal data, for sending this email. by the Ministry of Public Transformation and Service. In addition, some complainants claimed to have been recipients of the email even though they are no longer public officials. 3. By email of January 27, 2023, the Commission services questioned the data protection officer of the two ministries (hereinafter ""the DPO"") on the following points: the applicable legal basis, the origin of the data used to send the email, the recipients of the email, the number of people affected by the processing, the identity of the data controller(s), the purposes of the processing, any prior information that may have been provided in order to facilitate the exercise rights, and any supporting element of the lawfulness of the processing. Two reminder emails were sent by the CNIL to the DPO on January 30 and February 1, 2023. 4. On February 2, 2023, the DPO responded by indicating in particular that the email had been sent to 2,346,303 people and specifying that this number corresponds to that of all active agents, tenured and non-tenured, registered in the digital space security of the public agent (ENSAP). 5. By email of February 14, 2023, the CNIL services requested additional information from the DPO, who responded on February 17, 2023 by attaching a copy of the email exchanges between the DGFiP and the general directorate of administration and the civil service (DGAFP) having preceded the sending of the disputed email to public officials deemed to be active. 6. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission, on June 13, 2023, appointed Ms. Sophie LAMBREMON as rapporteur on the basis of article 39 of decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 amended. 7. At the end of her investigation, the rapporteur, on June 22, 2023, notified the ministries of a report detailing the breach of Article 5-1-b) of the general data protection regulation (hereinafter "" GDPR"") which it considered constituted in this case. This report proposed to the restricted formation to issue a call to order against the ministries. He also proposed that this decision be made public and no longer allow the ministries to be identified by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. 8. On July 20, 2023, the Minister of Transformation and Public Service produced his observations in response to the sanction report. It was then confirmed to the CNIL services that this response was common to the two ministries targeted by the procedure. 9. By letter dated August 17, 2023, the rapporteur informed the ministries that the investigation was closed, in application of article 40, III, of amended decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019. 10. By letter of September 7, 2023, the ministries were informed that the file was included on the agenda of the restricted training of October 5, 2023. 11. By email of October 4, 2023, the ministries were informed of the postponement of the restricted training session. By letter dated October 12, they were informed that its date was set for October 26, 2023. 12. The rapporteur and representatives of the ministries were heard during the restricted training session. II- Reasons for the decision A- On the quality of joint processing managers of the ministries 13. The data controller is defined, under the terms of Article 4, point 7, of the GDPR, as ""the natural or legal person, public authority, service or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing. Under Article 26 of the GDPR: “When two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of the processing, they are joint controllers.” 14. The processing at issue in this procedure is the use of the electronic addresses of public officials for the purposes of sending the email of January 26, 2023 with the subject ""Pension reform: Message from Stanislas Guerini to civil service agents "", hereinafter ""the treatment"". 15. The rapporteur considers that the Ministry of Transformation and Public Service and the Ministry of the Economy must be considered jointly responsible for the processing in question, taking into account, on the one hand, that it involves two full-time ministries and on the other hand, elements communicated by the DPO regarding the respective roles of the DGAFP and the DGFIP in sending the disputed email to “state agents”. 16. In defense, the ministries do not dispute their joint responsibility. 17. Firstly, the restricted panel notes that it appears from the email exchanges between the two directorates that the DGAFP asked the State pension service (SRE) of the DGFiP on January 16, 2023 to send a communication to State agents ""on the measures included in the pension bill currently being prepared"", specifying that this would take the form of two separate messages, ""one aimed at active workers, the other at destination of pensioners"", before finally returning to his request by an email of January 18, 2023, specifying ""It is ultimately a question of addressing only active agents"". The same exchanges show that the DGAFP transmitted to the DGFiP the message to send to active agents, asking the following questions: ""is it possible to embed the video so that it can be viewed in the e-mail ? "" and "" What statistics could you obtain? We will notably ask for the opening rate, the viewing rate of the video and even the number of clicks on the attached ppt if possible "". It thus appears that the DGAFP, wishing to send a communication to active State agents on pension reform, has defined the purposes of the processing. Then, by requesting the DGFiP to send the email and giving it instructions relating to the content and form of the communication, the DGAFP defined the means of processing. The restricted training also notes that it appears from the exchanges between the DGFiP and the DGAFP of January 23, 2023 that the DGFIP carried out technical tests with a view to sending the email and that it ""gave the functional go for sending from the mass mail \[on\] Thursday January 26"". 18. The restricted panel thus considers that the Ministry of Transformation and Public Service, through the DGAFP, participated in determining the purposes and means of the processing. 19. Secondly, article 1 of decree no. 2022-1446 of November 21, 2022 setting out the terms of processing of ENSAP provides that “the general directorate of public finances implements the automated processing of personal data called “ENSAP. 20. If Decree No. 2022-842 of June 1, 2022 relating to the responsibilities of the Minister of Transformation and the Public Service provides for functional authority of this Minister over the DGFiP, for ""questions relating to public budgetary and accounting management and the State's real estate policy"", it follows from the DPO's writings that the administration considers that the action of the DGFiP in sending this message exceeded this framework and that its action then fell within the authority of the Economy Minister. The restricted training also considers that by using the ENSAP file and by determining some of the means of the processing in question, the Ministry of the Economy, through the DGFiP, has also determined the purposes and means of the processing. 21. The restricted panel considers, taking into account these elements, that the Ministry of Transformation and Public Service and the Ministry of the Economy must be considered jointly responsible for the processing in question. B- On the failure to comply with the obligation to process data in a manner compatible with the purposes for which they were collected pursuant to Article 5, paragraph 1, b) of the GDPR 22. Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR provides that “Personal data must be: / (…) collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and not subsequently processed in a manner incompatible with these purposes ; (…) “. 23. The rapporteur notes that the electronic addresses used in the context of the processing in question are those collected under Decree No. 2022-1446 of November 21, 2022 setting out the terms of the processing of ENSAP and that they were processed manner incompatible with the purposes provided for by the said decree to send a message relating to a communication of a political nature. 24. In defense, the ministries maintain that the SRE, which operates the ENSAP processing within the DGFiP ""provides information to nationals of the retirement plan for civil and military civil servants of the State, particularly with regard to the right to 'information on pensions', and that it thus acted in its mission of public interest of information. They indicate that they however take note of the reactions triggered by the communication in question and that a census of the contact details of users who have expressed themselves to no longer receive information from ENSAP has been carried out so that they are excluded from possible future communications. Furthermore, an evolution of the ENSAP interface, planned for December 2023, will allow users to directly refuse the receipt of information emails. 25. The ministries then contest the qualification of political communication retained by the rapporteur by asserting in particular that the user had the choice of watching or not the video attached to the email, and that ""the sending was not intended to promote the project of reform, but rather to inform, as an employer, public officials on the specific areas concerning them and the very concrete impact that could result for them. In this regard, the ministries consider that the various subjects covered in the video (such as taking into account the arduousness of so-called active categories or the explanations provided on progressive retirement) as well as the powerpoint were purely informative, without the format of the speech by the minister himself constitutes a characteristic element of a political communication, the minister of transformation and public service being able, as a public employer, to address directly and personally to all of the public officials on all administrative and human resources management issues. 26. Firstly, the restricted panel notes that, as indicated by the DPO of the two ministries to the CNIL services, the electronic addresses used in the context of the processing in question come from a contemporary extraction from ENSAP and relate to active agents. The restricted training recalls that when processing is governed by a regulatory act, its purposes can only be those authorized by this act. 27. Under the terms of Article 1 of Decree No. 2022-1446 of November 21, 2022 setting out the terms and conditions for the processing of ENSAP, ""the purpose of this processing is to provide public officials with a secure digital space offering services personalized documents relating to State pensions, pay and elections of staff representatives in the State civil service. As such, it allows the public agent: 1° To have a tool of exchange and communication with the administration; 2° To have an archiving space for documents relating to State pensions (…) and pay"". It follows from these provisions that the processing in question only allows the administration to send emails to public agents informing them that a document is available on the ENSAP platform in order to offer them personalized services. 28. Secondly, the restricted training recalls that the automated processing of personal data of public officials whose purpose is limited, by the regulatory act which governs them, to a communication of an administrative nature, cannot be used for a communication of a political nature (CNIL, FR, September 3, 2020, Sanction, n°SAN 2020-005, published; CNIL, FR, September 3, 2020, Sanction, n°SAN 2020-006, published; CNIL, FR, July 24, 2018, Sanction, No. SAN 2018-007, published). She notes that the email of January 26, 2023 in question is signed by the Minister of Transformation and the Public Service and refers in particular to a video containing an official speech from him presenting the pension reform. The restricted training notes that this video contains - as indicated by the ministries - concrete details on the way in which the pension system would evolve, as does the powerpoint entitled ""For our pensions: a project of justice, balance and progress. However, this sending comes shortly after the presentation by the minister in January 2023 of the envisaged reform, and this before the adoption of the project by Parliament. The restricted training also considers that certain terms used and the general content of the message aim to convince of the necessity and merits of the reform: ""we must work longer to preserve our pay-as-you-go pension model""; “our distribution system to which we are all attached \[…\] protects the most vulnerable”; the measures are described as “measures of justice, of progress”; finally, the reform ""will allow us very concretely, I hope to have demonstrated it to you with some very concrete axes, to improve our system without hiding the fact that yes, we are asking an effort from each of you and for that , I want to thank you "". Finally, contrary to what is usually done for communications via ENSAP (for computer security reasons), the email received by the agents did not invite them to consult a message in ENSAP, but contained the message with a link to a video hosted on a third-party service. 29. Thus, contrary to what the ministries maintain, the email signed by the minister, the format of the video and the general content of the message do not correspond to a communication between public officials and their administration. If it is open to the administration to communicate to its agents all the information necessary for the exercise of their mission or relating to their status as public agent, it can only do so in compliance with the provisions governing the files that she uses. More generally, respect for the principle of purpose implies that processing operations instituted for the needs of the public service or the employment of public agents are not used for the purposes of political communication with public agents. The restricted panel considers that, in this case, the approach is a political communication action on the part of one of the ministers responsible for said reform. 30. The restricted panel concludes that the ENSAP file was used for political communication purposes and that the processing in question does not correspond to the purpose provided for by the decree constituting this processing of ""communication between the agent and administration. The use of ENSAP for sending these messages therefore disregards Article 1 of Decree No. 2022-1446 of November 21, 2022 which sets the purposes of the processing. 31. It follows from the above that by using the electronic addresses of active public officials collected under ENSAP processing to communicate on pension reform, the Ministry of Transformation and Public Service and the Ministry of the Economy , Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty, joint controllers of the processing, processed said personal data in a manner incompatible with the purpose of the collection in breach of Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR. II. On the corrective measure and its publicity 32. Under the terms of III of article 20 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended: ""When the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or from this law, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and Liberties may also , if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, where applicable in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted formation of the commission with a view to pronouncement, after adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures: 1° A call to order; \[…\] "" 33. Under 7° of III of article 20 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended, in the event that the processing of personal data is implemented by the State, a fine cannot be imposed. administrative. 34. The rapporteur proposes to the restricted formation that a call to order be issued against the Ministry of Transformation and Public Service and the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Sovereignty industrial and digital. She also suggests that this decision be made public. 35. The ministries dispute the existence of a breach. 36. The restricted panel considers that, in the present case, the breach committed justifies a call to order against the ministries for the following reasons. 37. The restricted training notes the particularly large number of people concerned, the email addresses of 2,346,303 people having been used to make them recipients of this communication. 38. In view of the nature of the joint data controllers who have public authority prerogatives, the restricted training considers it necessary to raise awareness among the ministries on the use of personal data held by the administration as part of its missions and of which the processing must comply with the applicable legal and regulatory framework. 39. Finally, and for the same reasons, the restricted panel considers it necessary for its decision to be made public. It notes, on this point, that the public has demonstrated, in recent months, a strong interest in questions relating to the processing of their personal data by the State, as evidenced by the unprecedented number of complaints received at the outcome of this communication. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: • Pronounce, with regard to the breach constituted in article 5-1-b) of regulation (EU) no. 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 relating to data protection: -a call to order against the Ministry of Transformation and the Public Service; -a call to order against the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the ministries by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. President Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be the subject of an appeal before the Council of State within two months of its notification."

The restricted formation adopted the following deliberation: I. Facts and procedure 1. The commune of KOUROU (hereinafter ""the commune""), is a territorial collectivity of 25,000 inhabitants, located in the single territorial collectivity of Guyana, whose town hall is located at 30 avenue des Roches in Kourou (97310). 2. By letter of June 2, 2021, within the framework of the missions defined in article 8 of law n°78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended relating to computing, files and freedoms, the President of the Commission National Data Protection Authority (hereinafter ""the CNIL"" or ""the Commission"") alerted the municipality of KOUROU to the absence of appointment of a data protection delegate (or ""DPD"") in her breast. 3. This letter received no response from the municipality of KOUROU (hereinafter “the municipality”). 4. On April 25, 2022, the President of the CNIL gave formal notice to the municipality, within four months of notification of this decision and subject to the measures that it could have already adopted, to proceed with the appointment of a DPO. This decision, made public after deliberation by the CNIL office on May 5, 2022, was notified to the municipality on May 19, 2022 by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt. 5. This formal notice remained without response from the municipality which did not designate a DPO. 6. As part of a simplified sanction procedure, the president of the restricted body pronounced, by decision of February 8, 2023, a fine against the municipality in the amount of five thousand euros for the breaches of the articles 31 and 37-1-a) of the GDPR and an injunction to appoint a data protection officer within three months following notification of the said decision, which took place on February 25, 2023. 7. In the absence of a response from the municipality and the appointment of a DPO, the president of the Commission, on August 28, 2023, appointed Ms. Valérie PEUGEOT as rapporteur on the basis of article 39 of decree no. °2019-536 of May 29, 2019 amended. 8. At the end of her investigation, the rapporteur, on September 13, 2023, notified the municipality of a report detailing the breaches of articles 37-1-a) and 31 of the general data protection regulations (hereinafter after “GDPR”) which it considered constituted in this case. It proposed to the restricted panel to issue a call to order and an injunction to appoint a data protection delegate accompanied by a penalty of one hundred and fifty euros per day of delay at the end of a period of two months following notification of the deliberation and that this decision is made public. 9. By letter dated October 19, 2023, the rapporteur informed the municipality that the investigation was closed, in application of article 40, III, of amended decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019. 10. By letter of October 20, 2023, the municipality was informed that the file was registered at the restricted training session of November 16, 2023. 11. By letter dated November 9, 2023, the municipality was informed that the file was postponed to the restricted training session on November 30, 2023. 12. The rapporteur was heard during the session of the restricted training on November 30, 2023. The restricted training noted the absence of the municipality which was neither present nor represented. II. Reasons for decision A. On the failure to fulfill the obligation to appoint a data protection officer pursuant to Article 37(1)(a) of the GDPR 13. In law, Article 37, paragraph 1, a) of the GDPR provides that “The controller and the processor shall in any case appoint a data protection officer when: a) the processing is carried out by a public authority or a public body, with the exception of courts acting in the exercise of their jurisdictional function \[…\]"". 14. The restricted training recalls the importance of the role of the data protection delegate, which has become mandatory within public authorities and bodies since the entry into force on May 25, 2018 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and the Council of April 27, 2016 relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of this data. The designation of a data protection officer is essential to ensure that organizations comply with the provisions of the GDPR. 15. The restricted training notes that public authorities responsible for public service missions process numerous personal data (data of citizens, public officials and elected officials), some of which are sensitive data and must take particular care to protect them. protection in a context of increasing computer attacks against public bodies. 16. The data protection officer is responsible, in accordance with Article 39 of the GDPR, in particular for informing and advising the data controller on the obligations incumbent on him, monitoring compliance with the GDPR by carrying out the analysis and verification of processing activities and acting as the point of contact for the supervisory authority on matters relating to processing. In addition, the data protection officer also constitutes the point of contact for the persons concerned, in particular the citizens, regarding questions relating to the processing of their personal data and the exercise of the rights conferred on them by the regulation in accordance with in article 38-4 of the GDPR. 17. In the present case, it appears from the investigation that the municipality did not appoint a data protection delegate even though it had been required to do so since May 25, 2018. 18. Consequently, the aforementioned facts constitute a breach of article 37-1-a) of the GDPR. B. On the failure to comply with the obligation to cooperate with the services of the CNIL in application of article 31 of the GDPR 19. In law, Article 31 of the GDPR provides that ""the controller and the subcontractor as well as, where applicable, their representatives cooperate with the supervisory authority, at the latter's request, in the execution of its missions. 20. In this case, the restricted panel notes that the municipality did not respond to the letter from the President of the CNIL of June 2, 2021 inviting it to appoint a data protection delegate, nor did it did not respond to the formal notice of April 25, 2022 and to the decision of the president of the restricted panel of February 8, 2023 ordering him to appoint a data protection delegate within three months following notification of his decision occurred on February 25, 2023. 21. Thus, the restricted panel considers that the municipality of Kourou, by refraining from responding to all correspondence from the CNIL, failed to comply with the obligation provided for in Article 31 of the Regulation. III. On corrective measures and their publicity 22. Under the terms of III of article 20 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended: 23. ""When the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or from this law, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and Liberties may also, where applicable after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, where applicable in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted formation of the commission with a view to pronouncement, after procedure contradictory, of one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 2° An injunction to bring the processing into compliance with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or this law or to satisfy requests presented by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights, which may be accompanied, except in cases where the processing is implemented by the State, with a penalty the amount of which cannot exceed €100,000 per day of delay from the date set by the restricted body; \[…\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the global annual turnover total of the previous financial year, the highest amount being retained. In the hypotheses mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted panel takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83. 24. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that ""Each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this article for violations of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive"", before specifying the elements to be taken into account when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and when deciding the amount of this fine. 25. In 2021, the overall closing result of the administrative account of the main budget of the municipality was in deficit of 13,094,989.01 euros. In 2022, its main budget was proposed by the regional audit chamber of Guyana with a deficit of 3,570,006 euros. 26. The restricted panel considers that, in the present case, the aforementioned breaches justify the imposition of an administrative fine and an injunction to appoint a data protection officer against the municipality. A. On the imposition of an administrative fine 27. The restricted committee recalls that it must take into account, when issuing an administrative fine, the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, seriousness and duration of the violation, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and the categories of personal data affected by the violation. 28. Restricted training highlights the central role of the data protection officer, the cornerstone of the liability regime, who facilitates compliance with the rules, acts as an intermediary between those administered and a public community and thus reinforces the trust placed in organizations public. 29. Given the nature of the organization concerned, a municipality of more than 16,000 inhabitants which carries out public service missions, the restricted training considers it necessary to raise awareness in the municipality of the essential protection of the personal data that it processes as part of its missions by appointing a data protection delegate. 30. The restricted panel considers that the continued absence of appointment of a data protection delegate by the municipality demonstrates a disregard for the obligations weighing on it in terms of the protection of personal data, and this, especially since this designation should have taken place upon the implementation of the GDPR on May 25, 2018. 31. The restricted panel emphasizes that this breach continued despite the various procedures initiated by the CNIL against the municipality. 32. Thus, the restricted formation notes that, despite the various corrective measures taken by the CNIL, namely a formal notice from its president to remedy this breach then a sanction from the president of the restricted formation accompanied by an administrative fine of five thousand (5,000) euros, the municipality has not taken the necessary measures to ensure compliance, despite the specific injunctions which had been addressed to it. 33. In addition, the municipality failed in its obligation to cooperate with the CNIL through the absence of any response. 34. Also, the restricted panel considers that the imposition of a fine against the municipality is justified by the persistence of the shortcomings relating to the absence of appointment of a data protection delegate and the lack of cooperation since the decision of February 8, 2023 rendered by the president of the restricted formation. 35. Furthermore, the restricted panel emphasizes that the acts sanctioned would be likely to cause a sufficiently serious attack on the provisions whose mission the CNIL is responsible for ensuring the application of and thus constitute a criminal offense in application of 2° of the article 226-22-2 of the penal code. 36. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that these breaches justify an administrative fine being imposed. 37. Regarding the amount of the fine, taking into account the activity of the organization which is a local authority and its financial situation, the restricted panel considers that the imposition of an administrative fine of 5,000 euros appears justified. B. On the issuance of an injunction accompanied by a penalty 38. Firstly, the restricted committee notes that the municipality has still not appointed a data protection delegate. 39. Given the persistence of the breach noted in connection with the appointment of a data protection delegate, the restricted panel considers it necessary to issue an injunction so that the municipality complies with its obligations. 40. Secondly, the restricted training emphasizes that a daily penalty is a financial penalty per day of delay that the data controller will have to pay in the event of non-compliance with the injunction at the end of the planned execution period. . 41. The restricted panel adds that in order to preserve the penalty's custodial function, its amount must be both proportionate to the seriousness of the alleged breaches but also adapted to the financial capacities of the data controller. 42. In view of these elements, the restricted panel considers proportionate the imposition of a penalty of 150 euros per day of delay and payable after a period of two months. C. On the publicity of the decision 43. Finally, the restricted panel considers it necessary for its decision to be made public in view of the seriousness of the breaches and their persistence. 44. She emphasizes that the protection of personal data by public authorities is all the more important as they process a considerable number of data, some of which are sensitive. In addition, cybersecurity issues, particularly in view of the increase in attacks against the information systems of these entities, highlight the importance of the role of the data protection delegate within public authorities. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: • pronounce against the municipality of KOUROU an administrative fine in the amount of five thousand (5,000) euros with regard to the breaches constituted in articles 31 and 37 of regulation (EU) no. 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 relating to data protection; • issue an injunction against the municipality of KOUROU to appoint a data protection delegate accompanied by a penalty of one hundred and fifty (150) euros per day of delay after a period of two months following notification of the deliberation of the restricted panel; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the municipality of KOUROU by name at the expiration of a period of one year from its publication; • order the municipality to publish, on the official website of the municipality of KOUROU accessible at the address https://www.ville-kourou.fr/, an information message intended for its users regarding this decision restricted training; The publication of this press release will be carried out according to the following methods: - The inserted insert will faithfully reproduce the following text: ""Press release: the restricted formation of the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties has pronounced a fine of 5,000 euros against the commune of Kourou and an injunction to appoint a delegate to the data protection with a fine of 150 euros per day of return within two months after notification of the decision for failure to appoint a data protection officer and the obligation to cooperate with the CNIL services.

Facts and procedure 1. The company AFL, a simplified joint stock company registered in the trade and companies register on January 3, 2000, is located at 67 boulevard du général Leclerc in Clichy (92110). Its turnover amounted to 1.135 billion euros in 2021, for a net profit of 58.9 million euros. 2. The company AFL is directly owned by the company Amazon EU SARL located in Luxembourg, itself 100% owned by the company Amazon.com Inc., located in the United States. 3. The company provides logistics support services as part of its parcel distribution activity in France. It thus manages large distribution centers in France, within which it receives, stores items and prepares packages for delivery. As of November 2019, the company had approximately 6,200 employees on permanent contracts. For the year 2019, it used 21,582 temporary workers. 4. In November 2019, pursuant to decision no. 2019-187C of the President of the Commission of September 26, 2019, several on-site inspection missions were carried out in the administrative premises occupied by several French entities of Amazon and at within society. The first two control missions, carried out on November 5 and 6, 2019, allowed the CNIL services to understand the processing of personal data implemented by the entities of the Amazon group in France with regard to its employees. . The last three control missions on November 13, 14 and 19, 2019, carried out in the Lauwin-Planque and Montélimar warehouses, focused on the processing implemented by the company AFL, namely, processing relating to monitoring of employee activity as well as the video surveillance systems implemented by the company. These missions gave rise to the establishment of minutes no. 2019-187.1, 2019-187.2, 2019-187.4, 2019-187.5 and 2019-187.6. 5. Following the on-site inspections, a written investigation continued and numerous exchanges took place between the CNIL services and the company from November 2019 to January 2021. 6. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission, on January 28, 2021, appointed Mr. François PELLEGRINI as rapporteur on the basis of Article 22 of Law No. 78-17 of January 6 1978 relating to computing, files and freedoms (hereinafter ""the law of January 6, 1978 as amended"" or ""the Data Protection Act""). 7. At the end of his investigation, the rapporteur, on April 4, 2022, notified the company of a report detailing the breaches of articles 5-1-a), 5-1-c), 6, 12, 13 and 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter ""the Regulation"" or the ""GDPR"") which he considered constituted in this case. This report proposed that the restricted panel impose an administrative fine on the company. He also proposed that this decision be made public but that it would no longer be possible to identify the company by name after a period of two years from its publication. 8. On June 20, 2022, the company produced its observations in response to the sanction report. 9. On November 9, 2022, the company was heard at its request in order to provide clarification on the data processing implemented with regard to its employees. This hearing resulted in the drawing up of minutes on which the company made comments sent to the Commission and the rapporteur on November 14, 2022. The company also sent the rapporteur, by email of November 16, 2022, answers to the questions listed in the hearing minutes. 10. The rapporteur responded to the company's observations on December 6, 2022. 11. On May 23, 2023, the company produced new observations in response to those of the rapporteur. 12. By letter dated July 20, 2023, the rapporteur informed the company and the president of the restricted panel of the closure of the investigation. 13. On July 24, 2023, the president of the restricted panel sent the company a notice to attend the session of the restricted panel on September 14, 2023. 14. The rapporteur and the company presented oral observations during this session. II. Reasons for decision A. On the complaint based on the irregularity of the holding of the session 15. During the hearing before the restricted panel, the president of the restricted panel, in accordance with article 13 of the CNIL's internal regulations, requested the hearing of an agent who participated in the controls. All the agents who participated in the controls having left the Commission's services, the floor was given to \[…\], an agent who participated in part of the controls carried out within Amazon distribution centers in France. 16. The company claims that a procedural irregularity would result from the hearing of a CNIL agent, questioned about facts that he could have observed as part of the series of controls carried out in November 2019 within Amazon entities in France, to the extent that this agent did not participate in the controls carried out within the AFL company. This notes that this agent only participated in controls within the administrative premises occupied by several French entities of Amazon and in the warehouse of another company in the group, \[…\]. 17. The restricted training notes that the agent heard, auditor of information systems, indicated that he considered that the tools and methods for monitoring the activity of employees within other French entities of Amazon are the same as within the AFL company. Furthermore, the intervention of the agent did not provide any new information on the processing implemented in warehouses and this decision is not based on an element indicated by this agent. 18. Consequently, the complaint based on the irregularity of the holding of the session must, in any event, be dismissed. B. On the presentation of the treatments implemented using scanners and their purposes 1. On the processing of individual indicators relating to the quality of work, productivity and periods of inactivity 19. Employees working in the company's warehouses are responsible, on the one hand, for receiving and storing items from suppliers (inventory) and, on the other hand, for picking and packaging these items, with a view to of their sending to customers as part of the execution of their orders. To do this, they are assigned to positions corresponding to the activity concerned (“reception”, “storage”, “picking” and “packing”). These positions largely correspond, according to Amazon terminology, to ""direct processes"" or ""direct tasks"", that is to say tasks on which the production volume can be measured using scanners which are provide employees. The scanners are small boxes equipped with a screen allowing the employee to identify themselves and receive instructions, as well as a barcode reader allowing them to scan the labels of the articles they are processing, or even the locations from which he stores or removes the articles. Employees may also be assigned to ""indirect tasks"", which are not or not entirely carried out using the scanners (for example, transporting bins to picking areas, checking for process errors, or training staff). new employees to basic processes). Employees may be required to occupy separate positions during the same working day. 20. By means of scanners, the company continuously collects data relating to the activity of employees assigned to direct tasks: the scans carried out by each employee thus make it possible not only to follow the good progress of each item throughout the various stages of preparation and distribution, but also to measure the employee's activity, by counting the number of units he processes over a given period, by counting the periods of time during which he does not process any units and by analyzing the level of quality with which these units are processed, with regard to detailed criteria. The use of scanners also makes it possible to identify errors, or error probabilities. 21. All of this activity data collected continuously using scanners is associated with the identity of the employee in the form of productivity and quality indicators relating to periods of inactivity. A very large part of this data therefore constitutes personal data. These indicators are accessible within computer activity monitoring tools. It follows from the documents in the file that the term indicator refers, in Amazon terminology, to different forms in which the data appears in the tools: it thus covers the raw data collected and the statistics which are continuously drawn from it (according to cases, hourly, daily or semi-daily, weekly, for example: Furthermore, the company also uses the term indicator to refer to specific types of indicators, divided into the three categories described below. 22. The company thus uses 43 ""quality indicators"" which correspond to ""actions of employees likely to cause quality errors"", such as putting an item in stock in a location other than that recommended or scanning too quickly articles. These indicators make it possible to report probable or proven errors by the employee in the item delivery process. 23. The company also produces indicators relating to the productivity of each employee, which it distinguishes from ""quality indicators"" and which include in particular the number of articles processed per hour, the last scans carried out and their exact time, the type of item, size and quantity. 24. The company finally deals with indicators intended to monitor employee interruptions during their working time on direct tasks. Thus, the fact that no data is received by the scanner for a certain time is indicated by different ""indicators"" in the tools. In particular, the ""Inferred time"" indicator (inferred time of scanner inactivity), collected by default after ten consecutive minutes of scanner inactivity, can correspond to several situations, including ""idle time"". , which is a period of inactivity with no apparent justification. Another indicator records any “latency time of less than ten minutes at critical times of the day”, i.e. at the start and end of a work session as well as before and after breaks. 25. Note that if the company designates all the data under the term ""indicator"", the restricted training will sometimes distinguish, in this decision, the raw data and the other statistical indicators, which are calculated from this raw data. 26. It is specified that indirect tasks are not monitored as closely as direct tasks. 27. This decision concerns the treatments thus described in all of the company's warehouses where they are carried out in France, since it appears from the documents in the file that these are treatments defined for all of France. On the other hand, the video protection processing also in question only relates to the Lauwin-Planque and Montélimar warehouses. 2. On the periodicity of the processing of indicators and their accessibility in the tools 28. The restricted training notes that, firstly, the three categories of indicators processed by the company (quality, productivity, periods of inactivity) are reported in real time, for each employee, within the activity monitoring tools. the disposition of hierarchical superiors. Thus, the latter have access, in particular and for each employee they supervise, to the latest errors made, to the time of each scan carried out, to the number of articles processed during the last hour, to details of working time of the employee on a given process and at any time of interruption of his scanner. 29. Secondly, all of these indicators relating to the activity of each employee are kept in the tools for 31 days and can thus be consulted, both via raw data and in the form of statistics, for example over an hour or half a day. 30. Third and finally, weekly performance reports are established for each employee based on indicators collected continuously. They contain weekly, daily and hourly statistics relating to compliance with quality procedures and productivity as well as raw data relating to quality errors. Finally, idle times, which do not appear in these performance reports, are nevertheless counted every week and are sometimes the reason for sending awareness letters. 31. The activity monitoring tools identified as part of the procedure are the following: - \[…\] provides access to nominal employee productivity indicators, including details of their working time on the same process. \[…\] also makes it possible to monitor aggregated indicators (overall productivity of a site by type of activity). This data is accessible in real time and over the last 31 days. - \[…\] is used to monitor the nominal quality indicators associated with the performance of direct tasks by employees. It also provides access to aggregated quality indicators (by error category or by position, for example). This data is accessible in real time and over the last 31 days. - \[…\] allows you to view the details of the tasks carried out by the employee (including their inactivity time). This detail is accessible in real time and over the last 31 days. - \[…\] is a work supervision tool which includes \[…\], \[…\] and \[…\]. - \[…\] provides quality and productivity statistics for each employee (per week, per day or per hour) and raw data concerning quality errors. 3. On the purposes of processing nominal indicators 32. The company indicates that the processing of indicators pursues the purposes of quality and safety assurance, management of warehouses and their workload (including for the purposes of reassigning employees in real time), and work planning. , employee evaluation, coaching (or support) and individual training as well as management of employee obligations regarding respecting working time. It specifies that the three categories of indicators are not all processed together for all purposes. 33. The rapporteur considers that several of the purposes put forward by the company cover very similar realities and, consequently, groups them into two sets, namely, on the one hand, the management of orders in real time and, on the other hand , work planning and performance evaluation in the broad sense. 34. In this regard, the restricted panel notes that the first set of purposes defined by the rapporteur, relating to the management of orders in real time in the warehouse, brings together the issues of inventory management (reception and storage) and orders (picking, packaging, shipping) in compliance with quality and safety requirements. The company emphasizes that these processes involve identifying any anomalies as quickly as possible, giving advice and providing real-time support to employees (coaching) and sometimes reassigning them in real time. She considers that this grouping of issues linked to the real-time management of inventory, orders and, by extension, the employees who process them, is relevant. Finally, it underlines that if this purpose relates to real-time management during work in warehouses, it is based both on real-time data, corresponding to the current working day, and on a historical 31 days past data. 35. The restricted training observes that the second set of purposes brings together all uses of data which are not carried out in real time during the inventory and order management processes. This concerns everything relating, on the one hand, to ex ante work planning, which consists in particular of deciding on the assignments of employees for a working day based on their past performance, and, on the other hand, part, to the evaluation of performance in the broad sense, ex post which includes the control of working time, weekly evaluation and individual training of employees. She considers that the grouping of this second set of purposes, which use all the employee's performance evaluation data to make decisions that do not concern the management of operational processes in real time, is relevant for the examination of the file. . It further notes that this second set of purposes, as opposed to the first, is based mainly on past data, except for the purpose relating to the control of working time, which is done both for the past and through access in real time to the processed indicators. 36. Therefore, the restricted panel considers that it is appropriate to follow the grouping of purposes made by the rapporteur within the two sets identified. C. On the quality of the company with regard to the processing in question 37. Under Article 4 (7) of the GDPR, the data controller is defined as ""the natural or legal person, public authority, service or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing. 38. The rapporteur considers that the company AFL acts as controller of the processing in question, in that it determines the purposes and means of processing the performance data of its employees using scanners, as well as the processing of video surveillance. 39. The company shares the rapporteur’s analysis on this point. 40. The restricted training emphasizes that the processing implemented by the company for the purposes of monitoring the activity and evaluating the performance of its employees are linked to human resources management and are therefore, essentially , carried out on behalf of the said company as a beneficiary of the work provided by its employees. The restricted training further notes that if the employee management processes (recruitment, dismissal) are based on a framework common to the entities of the Amazon group, these are declined and operated at the national level and in compliance with each national legislation; in addition, these “are subject to local adaptations, decided autonomously by society”. The restricted training therefore considers that the company is autonomous in the individual management of its employees, just as it is free to locally adapt the criteria developed at group level to evaluate the performance of employees working in its warehouses. 41. With regard to the video surveillance processing implemented by the company in its Lauwin-Planque and Montélimar warehouses, the restricted training notes that the guide relating to the legal framework for the installation of video surveillance cameras in the group's premises Amazon, established for the Europe zone and containing specifications by country, provides that each company in the group decides, taking into account the legal framework, the installation of these surveillance cameras for the legitimate purposes that it determines. 42. It follows from the above that the company AFL acts as responsible for processing data for monitoring the activity and evaluating the performance of its employees using scanners, as well as video surveillance processing. 43. It is therefore up to the restricted panel to examine, with regard to this quality, the complaints formulated by the rapporteur against the company. D. On the competence of the CNIL 44. Under the terms of Article 55.1 of the GDPR, “\[e\]ach supervisory authority is competent to exercise the missions and powers with which it is vested in accordance with this Regulation in the territory of the Member State to which it belongs”. 45. Article 4 (23) defines cross-border processing as: ""a) processing of personal data which takes place in the Union in the context of the activities of establishments in several Member States of a controller or a subcontractor where the controller or subcontractor -processor is established in several Member States; or (b) processing of personal data which takes place in the Union in the context of the activities of a single establishment of a controller or processor, but which materially affects or is likely to affect significantly affected persons in several Member States. 46. Therefore, the restricted panel considers that the CNIL is competent to control the processing operations in question, which do not have a cross-border nature within the meaning of Article 4 (23) of the aforementioned GDPR. 47. In application of article 55.1 of the GDPR, the restricted committee considers that the CNIL is competent to initiate a sanction procedure concerning the processing of personal data implemented by the company falling within the scope of the GDPR, provided that these treatments are linked to its territorial jurisdiction. 48. In this regard, the restricted training firstly notes that the processing of employees' personal data is carried out within the framework of the activities of an establishment of a data controller on the territory of the EU within the meaning of article 3 of the GDPR. Indeed, the processing of employees' personal data is implemented within the framework of the activities of the company AFL, which has its head office in France. 49. Next, the restricted panel notes that the processing in question is carried out within the framework of the activities of the company AFL and that it affects or is likely to affect exclusively employees working in the company's warehouses located in France. Consequently, they do not have a cross-border nature within the meaning of Article 4 (23) of the GDPR and the cooperation procedure between supervisory authorities provided for in Chapter VII of the GDPR is therefore not intended to apply in this case. . 50. This analysis is not contested by the company. 51. Therefore, the restricted panel considers that the CNIL is competent to control the processing operations in question. E. On the shortcomings relating to the processing of data for monitoring activity and evaluating employee performance 1. On the applicable legal framework 52. Firstly, Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR provides that personal data must be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (minimization of data )"". It follows from these provisions that it is illegal to process employees' personal data for certain purposes if these can be achieved without recourse to it. 53. Secondly, on the one hand, under the terms of Article 6. 1. f) of the GDPR, ""the processing is only lawful if, and to the extent that, at least one of the following conditions is met: (…) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, unless overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require data protection. personal character \[…\] "". 54. Recital 47 of the GDPR specifies that “\[t\]he legitimate interests of a controller \[…\] may constitute a legal basis for processing, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are overridden. prevail, taking into account the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller. \[…\] In any event, the existence of a legitimate interest should be carefully assessed, in particular in order to to determine whether a data subject can reasonably expect, at the time and in the context of the collection of personal data, that they will be processed for a given purpose. \[…\] "" 55. In its opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interest pursued by the data controller within the meaning of Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC, adopted on April 9, 2014, the working group of Article 29 (known as ""G29"", now the European Data Protection Board - EDPS) emphasized that a broad interpretation should be given to the notions of ""interests"" and ""rights"", in the sense that “all relevant interests of the data subject should be taken into account.” The G29 also clarified that when assessing the impact of the treatment, ""in addition to the negative consequences which may be specifically anticipated, one must also take into account the moral repercussions, such as irritation, fear and distress which may result from the loss of control exercised by the data subject over his or her personal information, or from the discovery of misuse \[…\] of this information \[…\]. \[…\] The term “impact”, such as it is used in this notice, covers all possible consequences (potential or actual) of the data processing"". 56. Finally, recital 75 of the GDPR provides details on the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons that may be induced by certain processing operations, the degree of seriousness and probability of which varies, and which may result in physical, material or moral damage. Among these risks, the recital mentions in particular those resulting from processing which targets vulnerable individuals and/or concerns a large volume of data. 57. The restricted panel notes that given the nature of the processing in question, the legal bases provided for by the provisions of Article 6.1 b), c), d) and e) of the GDPR and linked to the execution of a contract, compliance with a legal obligation, the protection of the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person and the execution of a mission in the public interest do not apply. It is therefore up to the restricted panel to examine whether the company can rely on its legitimate interest to carry out the processing in question, this legal basis being the only one likely to be used. 58. Under the terms of Article L. 1121-1 of the Labor Code: “No one may place restrictions on the rights of individuals and individual and collective freedoms that are not justified by the nature of the task to be accomplished nor proportionate. to the desired goal. The rights and freedoms protected are, in particular, the right to private and personal life, the protection of personal data, the right to the protection of one's physical and mental integrity. It results from consistent case law of the Court of Cassation that if the employer has the right to monitor its employees, it must do so by means proportionate to the objectives pursued (see for example Cass. Soc., June 23, 2021, n ° 19-13.856). 59. It follows from all of the aforementioned provisions that the processing of personal data such as that implemented with regard to the company's employees or temporary workers in the context of the management of its distribution centers cannot be based, for the application of article 6 of the GDPR, only on the legal basis of legitimate interest, provided that it does not cause a disproportionate attack on the rights, freedoms and interests of employees. 2. On shortcomings related to the purpose of managing stocks and orders in real time in the warehouse: reception of items, storage of inventory, preparation of orders, shipping of packages, including coaching to employees and their reassignment 60. As a preliminary point, the restricted training notes that the company claims that it manages processes of extreme complexity since, to offer each of its customers an optimal purchasing experience, it receives, controls the quality, stores , picks, packs, sorts, prepares and ships approximately \[…\] and employing a large number of employees (4,372 employees employed on the Lauwin-Planque site in 2019). The daily preparation and shipping of these millions of items of various nature must be carried out within the deadlines corresponding to the expectations of the company's customers and, in the case of Amazon Prime customers, to the service they have specifically paid for, e.g. example a delivery during the day. The company argues that its employees are at the heart of these operations and that automated processing in its distribution centers is therefore essential to support their work, in order to control stocks and processed packages, guarantee safety, quality and availability. efficiency of operations both at the individual and collective level. They are, according to the company, also designed to ensure that operational flow is maintained at an appropriate pace. 61. In Amazon's warehouses, objects are not classified but arranged as they go on the shelves, where there are spaces available, which makes it crucial that each handling of each object is traced in the warehouse information system using scanners. The company stressed that the slightest error could have significant consequences on the tracking of orders, the quality of service provided and potentially, on the safety of employees. It is therefore necessary to identify and be able to react in real time to the slightest error or deviations from objectives. 62. The restricted training does not call into question the fact that the service provided by Amazon to its customers entails exceptional constraints, due to the volumes processed and the objectives of short delivery times, which makes very precise monitoring necessary, in real time, of all manipulations of objects in the warehouse and of the situation of each workstation, therefore of each employee. This tracking involves the processing of a very large amount of data, including a lot of personal data in real time, each time the package is handled by an employee as part of direct tasks. 63. Following the position of the rapporteur, the restricted training therefore does not generally call into question the real-time processing by the company of the raw data and indicators described above for the proper management of stocks and orders. However, it considers, as will be explained below, that some of the indicators used ignore the GDPR, as well as the fact of keeping all the data reported by the scanners for 31 days and using this set of data and all the indicators extracted from it. 64. The analyzes developed in this decision relate to both employees and temporary workers, even if for convenience of language, reference will often only be made to employees. 2.1. On the illegality of the processing of three indicators for the management of stocks and orders 65. The rapporteur criticizes the company for processing Stow Machine Gun indicators, idle times and latency times of less than ten minutes and thus disregarding Article 6 of the GDPR, since it causes a disproportionate impact the rights of employees to privacy, the protection of their personal data, working conditions that respect their safety, health and dignity, and in particular the right not to be subject to excessive surveillance in application of article L. 1121-1 of the labor code. 2.1.1. On the processing of raw quality data linked to the speed of execution of a task (Stow Machine Gun indicator) 66. The indicator whose processing is examined in this sub-part is the raw quality data corresponding to the Stow Machine Gun indicator, attached to each employee assigned to a direct task and accessible in real time in the monitoring tool quality errors \[…\]. 67. The rapporteur observes that, among the 43 quality indicators processed by the company, there is the Stow Machine Gun indicator, which signals ""the storage of an article within (sic) 1.25 seconds of the storage of the previous article "". The rapporteur notes that this indicator linked to the speed of execution of a task is collected in real time for each employee in the quality error monitoring tool. However, he considers that the processing of this data is disproportionate since it leads to excessive computer surveillance of the employee with regard to the objectives pursued. 68. In defense, the company argues that the processing of this indicator is based on its legitimate interest in ensuring safety and quality in its warehouses. It indicates that the process of putting away items requires the employee to carry out several actions (scan of the item, scan of the location, etc.) and that if an interval as short as 1.25 seconds is reached during successive putting away of several articles, this would almost systematically indicate a quality error, likely to create a safety risk or inventory errors. 69. In this regard, the restricted training notes that the interest of the company, as an employer, in ensuring the quality and safety of its processes in its logistics centers, both for the customer and the employee, constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6.1. f) GDPR. 70. In this case, the restricted panel does not dispute that the Stow Machine Gun indicator makes it possible to ensure that too rapid successions of scans do not cause an error. 71. However, the interest of society in ensuring safety and quality in its logistics centers must be weighed against the interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of the persons concerned, taking into account their reasonable expectations, based on their relationship with the data controller, in accordance with Article 6.1.f) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital 47 and the aforementioned opinion on the notion of legitimate interest. 72. In this case, the restricted panel notes that collecting the Stow Machine Gun indicator amounts in practice to monitoring the speed of succession of the employee's actions, in each of the gestures he performs on a direct task, by associating an error indicator each time this speed is less than 1.25 seconds. However, the restricted training notes that this information reveals the behavior of the employee in the way in which he carries out his direct tasks and is likely to exercise on him continuous monitoring of the deadlines associated with each of his actions on direct tasks, with a measure of the order of a second. It therefore considers that this indicator has a significant intrusive nature and that its processing is likely to have negative moral repercussions on the employee, which may result from this continuous monitoring that it allows of their activity on direct tasks. The restricted training also notes that the processing of this indicator concerns a large number of people, since it targets all employees working in its warehouses. 73. Furthermore, the restricted training considers that surveillance of such precision exceeds the reasonable expectations of employees who, if they can expect, as employees of the company, that their work does the subject to a certain amount of surveillance, cannot however reasonably expect that their actions carried out with the scanners will be followed to the nearest second. 74. Therefore, the restricted panel considers that the processing of this indicator exceeds what is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the company in ensuring quality and safety in its logistics centers, since it excessively undermines the rights and interests employees working in warehouses - in particular those to the protection of their private and personal lives, as well as their right to working conditions that respect their health and safety. 75. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that the processing of the Stow Machine Gun indicator attached to the identity of the employee has no legal basis, in breach of Article 6 of the GDPR. 76. The restricted panel notes that in its latest written observations, the company announced the upcoming cessation of processing of the Stow machine gun indicator. It notes, however, that this measure is not effective on the day of the meeting and that it cannot in any case exonerate the company from its responsibility for the past. 2.1.2. On the processing of idle times and latency times less than ten minutes 77. The indicators whose treatment is examined in this sub-part are two indicators relating to periods of inactivity collected via the scanners, namely idle times, qualified from inferred times which record any latency time of a scanner greater than ten minutes and latency times less than ten minutes for employees assigned to a direct task, whether they are accessible in real time or over the last 31 days. Idle time records times of more than ten minutes of inactivity on a direct task without any apparent justification and latency time of less than 10 minutes measures, as its name indicates, times of less than ten minutes ""at critical moments of the day"", i.e. at the start and end of the work session as well as before and after breaks. 78. The rapporteur notes, on the one hand, that it appears from the investigations that the company processes idle times, which appear in the tools in the form of a blue bar after a period of ten minutes of inactivity of a to scan. He notes that depending on the company, an idle time can materialize three situations: (1) the employee encounters a technical problem preventing the proper execution of his direct task, (2) the employee does not sufficiently master a direct process and needs of specific support, (3) the employee does not perform his or her direct duties due to excessive unauthorized breaks outside of break times. The rapporteur also notes that it also emerges from the company's investigations and latest observations that the latter processes an indicator relating to scanner inactivity periods of less than ten minutes (latency times less than ten minutes) , also appearing in the tools in the form of a blue bar. He notes that according to the company, this indicator would reflect ""latency times at critical times of the day"", that is to say when all employees take or leave their workstation on a direct task, i.e. at the start or end of work session or just before or after the break. 79. The rapporteur considers that the nominative treatment of idle time and latency times of less than ten minutes is disproportionate for the purposes of managing inventories and orders in real time, including in order to provide advice or support to an employee who encounters a problem on a task. Furthermore, given the size of the teams managed by supervisors, which can include up to 250 people, the rapporteur questions the ability of a supervisor to detect such low latency times for an employee in his team. and to intervene immediately to verify that there are no problems. 80. In defense, the company argues that the processing of idle times is necessary for the management of warehouses and their workflows, in that it would make it possible to quickly reveal and resolve a problem in a direct process. Regarding the indicator relating to latency times of less than ten minutes, the company maintains that it would aim to identify and resolve practical problems encountered by an employee likely to disrupt transitions between teams or job resumptions, in a context where visual control by supervisors is impossible. 81. The restricted training observes that the objective of the warehouse management company and its workload corresponds more concretely to the management of inventories and orders in real time while respecting quality and safety requirements and that it constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6.1. f) GDPR. It notes that the objective of coaching an employee who encounters difficulties in carrying out a task also constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of this provision. 82. However, on the one hand, the restricted training firstly notes that supervisors have access to numerous aggregated (non-nominative) quality indicators (by error category, by cause, by position, etc.) and productivity (by type of activity, by team) to manage warehouses and their workflows. She emphasizes that these aggregated indicators allow them to identify in real time variations in productivity that need to be remedied immediately or error rates likely to significantly impact the smooth running of the warehouse. In addition, the restricted training emphasizes that the rapporteur does not dispute the need to access the quality indicators of each employee to detect and resolve problems that hinder the proper circulation of items in the warehouse and the execution of orders in the compliance with quality and safety requirements (errors, delays, flows, etc.). Thus, the restricted training notes that supervisors can in particular, as is already the case, establish a link between the employee and a quality error committed in real time in order to resolve it and avoid slowdowns or blockages in the chain. treatment. 83. Next, the restricted training notes that the treatment of idle times linked to the identity of each employee presents a significant intrusive nature, since it forces in practice the employee to be able to justify any time considered non-productive. Thus, the restricted training considers that although employees can expect to see their quality indicators used to ensure the secure and qualitative management of articles and packages in real time in the warehouse, they cannot however reasonably expect potentially having to justify very short interruptions at any time, time considered non-productive, when they occur. It considers that the treatment of idle times for employee coaching purposes is also disproportionate, for these same reasons. The restricted training considers in fact that the treatment of this indicator is likely to have negative repercussions on the employee, possibly resulting from the continuous monitoring that it allows very short times on direct tasks considered as non-productive. 84. Consequently, the restricted training considers that, given the excessively tight control of the employee that it allows and with regard to the monitoring of difficulties already made possible by access to the individual quality indicators of each employee and to the aggregated quality indicators and productivity, the treatment of nominative idle times is disproportionate with regard to the legitimate interests of the company aiming, on the one hand, to ensure qualitative and secure management of articles and packages in real time in the warehouse and, on the other hand , to provide immediate advice or support to the employee. She specifies that the use of this indicator for monitoring compliance with obligations relating to working time, as well as for the evaluation and training of employees, will be examined later. 85. On the other hand, for identical reasons, the restricted panel considers that the treatment of the indicator relating to latency times of less than ten minutes entails, a fortiori, an excessive infringement of the rights of employees with regard to the interests legitimate qualitative and secure management of packages and items in real time. The restricted training notes that this indicator makes it possible in particular to know how many minutes (between one and ten) have passed ""between the moment when an employee badged at the entrance to the site and the moment when he carried out his first scan of the day "". However, on the one hand, supervisors can already rely on numerous aggregated productivity and quality indicators, as well as certain individual indicators, to detect and immediately resolve problems hindering the proper execution of orders. On the other hand, the processing of this indicator leads the employee to potentially have to justify, each time they arrive on site, transition or return to work, any latency time of their scanner of less than ten minutes. It therefore presents, like idle times, a strong intrusive nature likely to have the same negative repercussions on the employee. 86. The restricted panel notes that in its latest observations, the company announces that it will increase to 30 minutes the threshold beyond which information relating to inferred time will be recorded in the tools and that this information will be accessible to supervisors not no longer in real time, but after a two-hour delay. During the restricted training session, the company affirmed that the increase in the duration triggering the recording of inferred times would apply to all the scenarios they cover. 87. In view of the above, the restricted training considers that the processing of idle times in order to manage inventory and orders in the warehouse in real time and for the purposes of providing advice or support to employees (coaching) is disproportionate with regard to the interests and fundamental rights of employees, in particular their right to the protection of their private and personal lives as well as their right to working conditions which respect their health and safety. The same applies to the processing of latency times of less than ten minutes implemented for the secure and qualitative management of inventory and orders in the warehouse in real time. 88. Therefore, the processing of these two indicators has no legal basis, in breach of Article 6 of the GDPR. 2.2. On the processing of quality and productivity indicators for the purposes of reassignment and advice/support (coaching) of employees in real time 89. The indicators whose processing is examined in this sub-part are the raw and statistical data of quality and productivity of each employee collected and accessible both in real time and over the last 31 days. 90. The rapporteur notes that in order to reassign employees in real time in the warehouse, the company accesses the quality and productivity indicators of each employee in real time and over a period of 31 days. He believes that in order to reassign employees with the aim of adjusting at any time to flows, to demand or to ensure a fair distribution of work, weekly individual statistics, which are added to the numerous other data available on warehouse activity in real time, are sufficient and even more suitable for this purpose. It also notes that the company does not need to access these same indicators for the purposes of coaching employees in real time, to the extent that a need for coaching can be identified on the basis of weekly data aggregated per employee. 91. In defense, the company considers that in order to identify the best performers among them and reassign them or distribute them differently if necessary, it must be able to access in real time, for each employee, the quality indicators and productivity, which includes the latest quality errors reported or committed, details of the last items processed (time, size, type, quantity etc.) and the total number of items processed in the last hour. The company also highlights the need to rely on detailed nominal indicators from the last 31 days, since they would offer line managers ""a reliable and complete view of the performance of a particular employee on a specific process when they need to ""Quickly assign someone with experience to this process."" According to the company, these indicators would allow supervisors to examine employees' previous quality and productivity levels after leave, to explain the causes of individual variations in productivity and to detect whether certain processes need to be improved. . 92. Regarding coaching, the company asserts, firstly, that supervisors must access both the quality and productivity indicators of each employee in real time and those of the last 31 days to be able to provide immediate support to the employee , for example if he encounters difficulties with a process, in order to know if he has already encountered this type of problem and to decide on the appropriateness and nature of the support. However, she admits that coaching can be provided later regarding less urgent difficulties, as part of the weekly assessment. The company contends that aggregated weekly data would only provide general trends and would not be precise enough to identify specific employee issues and their context. 93. The restricted training examines, at this stage of its decision, the use of personal data collected via the scanners for the purposes of reassignment and advice or support (coaching) of employees, in real time, during the hours of work. It appears from the documents in the file that, beyond the good management of objects (reception, storage, recovery for an order, packaging, shipping) enabled by the data collected by the scanners, the operational conduct of Amazon's activity requires identifying in real time employees having difficulty carrying out the tasks and objectives assigned to them by the company, or peaks of activity in certain locations requiring the assignment of new high-performance employees. If it is up to the company to ensure that these objectives and the pace are compatible with the requirements of labor law, the restricted training reminds that it is not up to it to examine this point. It considers that the purposes of optimizing work processes, through the reassignment of employees or through advice and support (coaching) provided in real time, are legitimate. 94. For these purposes of reassignment and advice/support (coaching) of employees working on direct processes in the warehouse, the company uses all the raw and statistical data on quality and productivity of each employee. The data accessible is both real-time data and data from the last 31 days. 95. The restricted training notes that the company illustrates the implementation of processing for the purposes of reassigning employees in real time by relying on a few examples relating to the need for assignment or reassignment of particularly efficient employees to a task to ensure on-time delivery or to improve overall center productivity. She observes that according to the company's declarations, reassignments only actually take place ""two to three times a day"" and emphasizes that the company already carries out planning allowing for anticipation of needs. 96. Restricted training does not call into question the operational need consisting of being able to identify in real time any need for advice/support or reassignment, then that of being able to determine the best advice or support, or the best reassignment by having data available. on the relative skills and performances of its employees. However, it considers, for the following reasons, that these needs do not require retaining and using all the raw data from scanners and indicators relating to direct tasks over a depth of 31 days. 97. On the one hand, the restricted training recalls that, with the exception of the three indicators considered disproportionate and mentioned above, it does not call into question the ability, for the company, to view all the raw data and indicators on real-time activity relating to direct tasks, in order to best manage inventory storage and order management. Data feedback makes it possible in particular to identify in real time any anomaly, any unexpected peak in activity or the fact that operational objectives are not achieved, in order to be able to immediately adopt appropriate corrective measures. Among these measures is the provision of advice or support to an employee, or their reassignment. 98. On the other hand, it is also legitimate, in order to be able to carry out this advice/support (coaching) or this reassignment, to have elements of evaluation of the employees, in particular to be able to choose the employee(s) to be reassigned. This may lead to viewing personal data on their respective performances. 99. However, the restricted panel considers that retention and access to all data used for these purposes for 31 days is not necessary. Regarding the examples given by the company relating to the need to provide advice/support (coaching) to employees in difficulty on certain tasks, or the need to assign or reassign particularly efficient employees to a task to guarantee delivery on time or to improve the overall productivity of the center, the restricted training notes that the company has individual weekly statistics relating to productivity and quality to rely on in the event of the need to quickly reassign an experienced person. For example, these statistics allow us to know that an employee has made no or very few quality errors on a job or to know the number of items he has packed during the week. There is therefore no need to access the slightest detail of the raw data or its indicators over the last 31 days, from the most general to the finest (up to statistics over one hour) to identify a particularly efficient employee. or to know its particular qualities. Correlatively, the restricted training notes that the company uses individual weekly statistics making it possible to note a drop in performance for a given employee. To the extent that these weekly statistics exist - which do not exclude the possibility that the company could design other forms of statistics that are clearly more limited than all the data and indicators currently used - the restricted training considers that the company has a representative view of an employee's performance in order to provide them with the best advice/support (coaching) during their working hours or to decide on their possible reassignment. The restricted training therefore considers that the conservation and access to raw data and details of quality and productivity indicators over a depth of 31 days is not necessary. 100. Regarding the examples cited by the company, relating to the case of an employee assigned for too long to the processing of bulky items or the incorrect storage of dangerous items, what would the current processing of indicators make it possible to detect in order to decide respectively a reassignment or immediate support, the restricted training considers that the identification of these situations does not require keeping and accessing such a precise history of the direct tasks of each employee over 31 days: the sole consultation of the data and indicators of the working day, in real time, appears sufficient. Once this situation has been identified, it is possible to remedy it by using certain data to assess the relative capabilities of employees, without needing to keep and use all of the data in question over a period of 31 days. Access for one month to such a wealth of personal data relating to each action of each employee by means of a scanner or to statistics established over very short periods relating to these actions is not necessary to determine the right advice to give or to decide on the right reassignment. A selection of aggregated data, in particular weekly or in another form, in addition to data describing the situation in real time during the working day, is sufficient. 101. Therefore, the restricted training considers that by processing individual quality and productivity indicators over a period of 31 days for the purposes of reassignment and advice/support (coaching) of employees, the company failed to do so. principle of minimization provided for in Article 5. 1. c) of the GDPR, to the extent that these indicators are not necessary in this case. Thus, if supervisors can rely on individual data to reassign employees or to provide them with advice/support (coaching), the granularity and methods of consulting the indicators collected are inappropriate. 2.3. On the effects of the changes announced by the company regarding the purposes of employee reassignment and real-time coaching 102. The restricted panel notes that in its latest observations, the company announces that it will soon implement a measure to reduce from 31 to 7 days the past period during which individual productivity and quality data are accessible to supervisors in the tools and, beyond this period, it will carry out data aggregation. During the restricted training session, the company specified that this aggregation would take the form of an aggregation of data over the week. In addition, as has already been indicated, the company announces the increase to 30 minutes of the threshold beyond which information relating to inferred time will be recorded in the tools and specifies that supervisors will not access this information in the tools only after a delay of two hours. 103. The restricted panel notes that these positive changes, announced at the end of more than three years of procedure, are not yet effective on the day of the meeting and that they do not exempt the company from its responsibility for the pass. 3. On shortcomings related to work planning and employee evaluation 104. The following facts are examined in light of Article 5.1.c) and Article 6.1. f) GDPR. 3.1. On processing implemented for work planning purposes 105. The indicators whose processing is examined in this sub-part are the raw data and productivity statistics of each employee accessible over the last 31 days. 106. The rapporteur notes that for the purposes of planning work in the warehouse, the company accesses the details of the productivity indicators of each employee over the last 31 days. According to the rapporteur, access to such granularity of data is not necessary, to the extent that indicators aggregated per employee over the week are sufficient to have a representative view of their individual productivity and to plan work in the warehouse . 107. In defense, the company asserts that access to productivity indicators for the last 31 days for each employee is necessary in order to constitute teams in a relevant manner taking into account the abilities and experience of employees on a given task, these have not necessarily received training on certain specific processes. It argues in particular that access to the types of articles processed by employees would make it possible to verify their level of mastery of a task and to designate those most capable of carrying it out (for example, for the processing of dangerous articles ). Data aggregated by week would not provide differentiated information taking into account the articles processed. 108. The restricted training considers, like the rapporteur, that work planning in the warehouse can be carried out on the basis of productivity statistics aggregated over the week per employee, which offer an objective view of the direct tasks carried out by the employee (number of times he has processed a certain type of article, overall time he spent on a given position during the previous week), and thus making it possible to assess his level of mastery of the different tasks and to compose relevant teams. The restricted training considers that weekly statistics are not the only ones legally usable, other systems being possible, but it notes that planning can be carried out by processing significantly less data. Therefore, it considers that the detailed productivity data for the last 31 days of each employee is not limited to what is necessary to establish the warehouse's work planning. 109. Regarding the company's argument that not all employees are trained in specific tasks or processes, which would make it necessary to have access to detailed indicators displaying the type of items processed in the past, restricted training emphasizes that the information according to which an employee has been trained on a specific task is distinct from the question of processing productivity indicators from the last 31 days, which are not intended to specifically provide such information. 110. Consequently, the restricted training considers that access to detailed productivity indicators of employees over the last 31 days for work planning purposes constitutes a breach of Article 5. 1. c) of the GDPR. 3.2. On the processing implemented for employee evaluation purposes 111. The restricted training recalls that the purposes covered by the evaluation of employees in the broad sense include the control of working time, weekly evaluation and individual training of employees. 3.2.1. On the specific question of processing idle times in order to control actual work during working time 112. The rapporteur notes that the company processes idle times in order to ensure that employees respect their working time obligations. According to him, these indicators are not necessary for the purposes of monitoring employees' working time. Indeed, he considers that the monitoring of the time spent at work enabled by the clocking system on arrival and departure of the day for the control of working hours (system \[…\]) is sufficient for this purpose. In any event, it considers that the treatment of this indicator for this purpose is disproportionate. 113. In defense, the company asserts that idle time is necessary for this purpose. In particular, it would make it possible to detect that an employee does not carry out their direct tasks during significant periods and outside of authorized breaks. According to the company, idle time would not be analyzed in real time but over longer periods and would not have the same purpose as the system \[…\]. In its latest written observations, the company distinguishes two objectives, namely, on the one hand, ""management of the employee's obligations in terms of respecting working time"" (which would be pursued by the treatment of idle times) and , on the other hand, that aimed at “monitoring the employee’s working time” (which would be pursued by the system \[…\]). 114. The restricted panel considers that the processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of monitoring the employee's working time and their actual work during these periods constitutes a legitimate interest of the company within the meaning of Article 6 1. f) of the GDPR. Idle time processing effectively contributes to this control to the extent that it makes it possible to identify any interruption of a certain duration in the processing of direct tasks. However, the restricted training considers that the use of this indicator in this context is disproportionate, since it forces the employee to be able to justify any time considered non-productive and thus amounts to computer monitoring of his interruptions throughout the his working day when working on direct tasks. The processing of idle times to monitor compliance with the employee's working time is therefore likely to have negative repercussions on the latter, induced by the pressure that may result from having to constantly justify interruption times for their scanner, even when they are brief. 115. Therefore, the restricted panel considers that the processing of the idle times of each employee for the purposes of monitoring actual work during this working time does not rest on any legal basis, in breach of Article 6 of the GDPR. 3.2.2. On the processing of indicators implemented for weekly performance evaluation purposes and for individual training purposes 116. The indicators whose treatment is examined in this subpart are, for each employee:  raw data and statistical quality and productivity data from the last 31 days;  data counted in individual weekly performance reports, namely statistical quality and productivity data per week, per day and/or per hour, as well as raw data concerning quality errors;  idle times recorded each week. 117. The rapporteur notes, on the one hand, that in order to evaluate the employee, the company establishes individual weekly performance reports intended for the employees' hierarchical superiors and containing statistical data on quality and productivity per week, but also per day or per hour, as well as raw data regarding quality errors. In addition, for the purposes of individual training and employee evaluation, the employees' hierarchical superiors can also access and use all of the raw and statistical quality and productivity data of each employee, which are kept for 31 days. . However, the rapporteur considers that all of these data are not necessary and that the establishment of quality and productivity statistics per employee, aggregated for example over the week, is sufficient to evaluate the employee, both from generally and to determine a possible training need. On the other hand, the rapporteur considers that the treatment of idle times, counted each week, is disproportionate both for the purposes of evaluation and individual training of the employee. 118. In defense, the company asserts that the rapporteur's proposal to rely on weekly individual quality and productivity statistics would make reliable evaluations of employees impossible. She maintains that access to the raw details of quality errors and their cause would be necessary, as well as access to productivity data by day and by hour, in order to allow the employee and his hierarchical superior to identify fine variations and to exchange on bases allowing a reliable evaluation. In its latest observations, the company specifies that it also accesses detailed indicators from the last 31 days for employee evaluation purposes, but reaffirms that it does not process idle time for this purpose and that the rapporteur's conclusions on this point must be set aside. Regarding training needs more specifically, the company argues that detailed indicators from the last 31 days are necessary, in particular as they make it possible to follow the learning curve of employees being trained from the start and to decide whether or not it should continue. After making contradictory statements regarding the processing of idle times for training purposes, the company finally indicated, during the session before the restricted training, that these indicators were in principle not processed within this framework but could be in particular cases. 119. Restricted training does not call into question the ability to carry out regular individual assessments, in particular in order to identify possible areas for improvement or training needs, relying on individual data to do so. However, like the rapporteur, she considers unnecessary and, at the very least, disproportionate the conservation and use of data as detailed and rich as the raw data reported by scanners and statistical data, including on short periods (one hour) and over a depth of 31 days. In this regard, the restricted training notes that the company already has individual weekly quality and productivity statistics making it possible to assess, on the one hand, the productivity of an employee, by means of accounting for the total number of articles processed over the week on the different processes (with sub-distinctions, by type of article processed for example) with regard to the time worked and, on the other hand, the quality of their work, via indicators having a high incidence for an employee in a given week. As for the interest alleged by the company in recording the raw details of each quality error to identify its causes, the restricted panel notes that during the session, the company confirmed that it was already establishing individual statistics. weekly reports on the causes of errors reported by the scanners. The restricted training therefore considers that such statistics are sufficient to identify a possible recurrence in the causes of errors committed by an employee over a week. Therefore, these statistical data are sufficient to make a reliable and objective assessment of the employee's performance over the week. Likewise, it considers, like the rapporteur, that the identification of training needs can be based on data aggregated over periods of time making it possible to provide a representative overview of the employee's work, for example over a week, and that access to all of the raw and statistical data, quality and productivity, from the last 31 days of each employee is therefore not necessary. Regarding the need invoked by the company to follow the progression curve of an employee, the restricted training notes that several quality errors of the same type or having the same cause, committed during the previous week on a process by a employee currently training or recently trained on this process, are sufficient to determine whether the training must be continued or completed. She observes that the company has not specified the average duration of the training but considers that, whatever this duration (a few hours, days or weeks), the weekly evaluation is an opportunity to examine whether the practical training has been sufficient. In any case, the restricted training considers that such a quantity of raw data and indicators is not necessary to monitor the progress of an employee throughout their training period. 120. Finally, the restricted panel notes that idle times are, in fact, processed for employee evaluation purposes since they are counted every week and are sometimes the origin of the sending of awareness letters. Likewise, she considers that given the equivocal explanations provided by the company during the session before the restricted training regarding the processing of idle times for individual training purposes – the company indicated that it did not process them in principle for this purpose but that they could be for particular cases - there is reason to consider that these indicators are well treated in this framework. However, first of all, the restricted training considers that the processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of evaluation and individual training of employees constitutes a legitimate interest of the company. However, the restricted training notes, on the one hand, that the processing of idle times is not necessary for these purposes, since both the realization of a reliable evaluation of the employee's performance and the identification of a possible need employee training on a poorly controlled process are already made possible by the processing of relevant productivity and quality indicators aggregated over the week, as noted above. On the other hand and in any case, the restricted training observes that the processing of idle times in this context leads to computerized inventory of all interruption times of an employee greater than ten minutes on direct tasks and to accumulate them over the week, which thus causes an excessive infringement, in particular, of the employee's right to private and personal life as well as his right to working conditions which respect his health and safety. 121. Therefore, the restricted training considers that by evaluating its employees on the basis of all the raw data and statistical productivity and quality data from the last 31 days accessed by the supervisors as well as, with regard to the purpose of evaluation, on the basis of the very detailed data contained in the weekly performance reports, the company failed to fulfill its obligations under the principle of minimization of article 5. 1. c) of the GDPR and, in any event, disproportionately infringed on the employee's rights contrary to Article 6 of the GDPR. Furthermore, the processing of idle times for these purposes disproportionately affects the rights and interests of employees and therefore has no legal basis, in breach of Article 6 of the GDPR. 3.3. On the effects of the changes announced by the company regarding the purposes of work planning and employee evaluation 122. The restricted training recalls that in its latest observations, the company announced the reduction from 31 to 7 days of the past period during which employee productivity and quality data will be accessible to supervisors in the tools. Beyond that, the data will be aggregated over the week, as the company clarified during the session. In addition, the company announced the increase to 30 minutes of the recording threshold of inferred time and the postponement of its appearance in the tools by two hours. 123. The restricted committee recalls that these changes, positive but announced late, are not yet effective on the day of the session and that they do not in any case remedy the shortcomings made in the past. 4. On the disproportionate nature of the retention of all personal data relating to ""direct tasks"" carried out by employees over 31 days, with regard to all the purposes pursued 124. The indicators whose treatment is examined in this subpart are, for each employee:  raw data and statistical quality and productivity data from the last 31 days;  idle times recorded each week. 125. After examining the different uses that are made of employees' personal data, the restricted panel considers it appropriate, as invited by the rapporteur, to consider globally the fact that the company permanently retains a considerable mass of data to personal character on its employees, for the various purposes mentioned. 126. The restricted training reminds that the company keeps, for each employee, all the raw data and indicators corresponding to the direct tasks detected by the scanners, over a period of 31 days. Furthermore, all the purposes put forward by the company correspond, abstractly, to its legitimate interests. However, it follows from what has been explained above that the restricted panel considers that such a mass of data, as precise and detailing each action (and inaction) of employees for direct tasks carried out during 31 days, is not not necessary to achieve the various purposes, whether planning work in warehouses or evaluating employee performance. Likewise, for the real-time management of object storage, inventory management and order shipping processes, it does not appear necessary to keep such a mass of data over the previous 31 days to take the decisions allowing the operational management of the warehouse and the resolution of possible difficulties. 127. Furthermore, the retention of such a mass of data on warehouse employees is particularly intrusive. As the rapporteur notes, the company's IT tools allow hierarchical superiors to consult all of the detailed activity and performance data collected and kept for each, including details of working time within the company. the same process, with a depth of 31 days. 128. Next, the restricted training notes that according to the company, the data processing in question only concerns the execution of direct tasks and indirect tasks represent 43% of the tasks carried out in the warehouses. Assuming this figure is correct - it does not emerge from the documents in the file - it is clear that the company stores data relating to a considerable number of actions carried out by warehouse employees during their working hours. In addition, the restricted training emphasizes that, without being of the same nature as that of direct tasks, monitoring of indirect tasks is also possible using data reported from the scanners. In particular, like the time spent on a direct task, the time spent on an indirect task is counted in the working time tracking tool and is included there. This allows the supervisor who consults the activity monitoring tools to know the exact moment and for what duration an employee worked on indirect tasks. 129. Finally, the restricted training notes that these treatments exceed the reasonable expectations of employees, since if they can expect a certain monitoring of their daily tasks in order to ensure smooth management of the warehouse, they cannot on the other hand, expect to see all of their actions recorded in IT tools and consultable in their smallest details over a depth of the last 31 days, whether to follow inventory and orders, their working time, decide coaching or reassignment, train or evaluate them. 130. In view of all of these elements, the restricted panel considers that the retention and access to such a quantity of data per employee over the last 31 days constitutes a form of disproportionate computer surveillance of employees, which appears excessive in with regard to the economic and commercial interests pursued by the company through these treatments. Indeed, the restricted panel considers that such processing constitutes a disproportionate attack on the protection of the private and personal lives of employees as well as their right to working conditions which respect their health and safety. 131. In conclusion, if the restricted training does not call into question, except for three of the indicators, the collection and use of real-time data for the daily and operational management of Amazon's inventories and deliveries, it generally considers unnecessary and disproportionate the fact of retaining all of this data for 31 days, since, according to its previously developed analysis, this retention did not prove necessary with regard to any of the purposes put forward by the company. These processing operations are carried out in disregard of Articles 5.1.c) and 6 of the GDPR, since they ignore the principle of minimization and exceed what is authorized by the pursuit of the legitimate interests of the company. The restricted panel specifies that it does not accept here an independent breach, but draws general conclusions from the analysis of the processing purposes by purpose. 5. On the failure to comply with the obligation to inform temporary workers 132. Under Article 12 of the GDPR, “the data controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 \[…\] regarding the processing to the data subject in a concise manner, transparent, understandable and easily accessible. 133. Article 13 of the GDPR also provides that the data controller provides the person concerned by the processing, at the time when personal data is obtained from them, several pieces of information listed in the same article. The Regulation does not prescribe the form in which this information must be provided. In practice, this information is generally grouped together in a confidentiality policy. 134. The rapporteur notes that, in the context of discussions following the on-site inspections, the company indicated to the delegation that its confidentiality policy applicable to human resources was available to temporary workers on the intranet. The rapporteur considers that temporary workers were not correctly informed of the processing carried out on them using the scanners since they were not directly given said policy and were not invited to read it either. in any way. However, it notes that, since April 2020, the company has ensured that temporary workers are informed, by requiring temporary agencies to submit an additional confidentiality policy relating to performance indicators against acknowledgment of receipt. 135. In defense, the company contests the breach. She argues in particular that the provision of information to temporary workers via the intranet was sufficient and that the CNIL itself recommends the use of the intranet as a valid means of communication. In any case, the company emphasizes that it now documents the communication of information to temporary workers and considers that assuming the breach has been established, the restricted training should distinguish the amount of the fine attributed to this breach from the total amount. and reduce it to take into account the improvements adopted. 136. The restricted training recalls that the provision to the persons concerned by the data controller of the information provided for in Article 13 of the GDPR must be made at the latest at the time when their personal data are collected, in a form which is accessible . However, as noted by the rapporteur, until April 2020, in a context where temporary workers were not provided with the confidentiality policy applicable to human resources and were not invited to read it on the intranet, this sole provision of this document on the company's intranet did not make it possible to satisfy these obligations by ensuring, in particular, that each temporary worker had been given the opportunity to read this document prior to the collection of personal data. 137. The restricted panel observes that temporary workers are in an identical situation to that of employees with regard to the processing carried out on them using scanners and must be informed thereof. Regarding the argument according to which the CNIL itself recommends the intranet as a valid means of communication, the restricted training notes that the CNIL recommends that the information be made ""according to the most appropriate methods depending on the ""organization and operation of the company"". In this case, it considers that information on the intranet intended for employees working daily in warehouses and not intended to work in an office on a computer, without any incentive to go there, does not does not constitute a satisfactory method of information. 138. Therefore, the restricted panel considers that a breach of Articles 12 and 13 of the GDPR has occurred for the period prior to April 2020. F. On the breaches relating to video surveillance processing 1. On the failure to comply with the obligation to inform individuals 139. Under Article 13 of the GDPR, the data controller must provide the data subject with certain information at the latest when the data is obtained directly from them. Among this information, Article 13.1 of the GDPR provides that “the contact details of the data protection officer” must be provided. Furthermore, under Article 13.2 of the GDPR, where necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing, ""the duration of data retention"" and ""the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. 140. The rapporteur notes that at the date of the inspections (in November 2019), the information panels relating to the implementation of video surveillance devices, displayed in the Lauwin-Planque and Montélimar warehouses to inform employees and potential visitors, did not indicate the contact details of the data protection officer, nor the duration of data retention, nor the right to lodge a complaint with the CNIL. It further notes that the missing information was not provided in any other medium or document. 141. In defense, the company denies having been in violation on the date of the inspections. It argues that several documents contained information relating to video surveillance processing and that the signs displayed in its warehouses complied with the recommendations of the CNIL at the time. She relies in particular on a press release from the CNIL dated 2015 (and available on June 12, 2018 on its website) and the fact that the EDPS guidelines on video surveillance were only adopted in January 2020, i.e. after the controls. She specifies that since the adoption of the EDPS Guidelines, the information panels and the information notice have been updated in accordance with the aforementioned guidelines. In any case, it indicates that it brought its information panels into compliance during the procedure. 142. The restricted training notes that at the date of the controls, i.e. November 2019, the GDPR had been applicable for a year and a half and that its article 13 contained the information that must be provided to the persons concerned at the time of collection of their personal data. It notes that the guidelines on transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, adopted on 29 November 2017 by the G29 which provided for the possibility of a multi-level approach for the provision of the mandatory information of Article 13 of the GDPR, already underlined their equal importance and the fact that they must be provided to the data subject. The CNIL communicated about these guidelines on July 16, 2019, emphasizing that “Prioritizing does not mean transmitting incomplete information to the people concerned: it is about highlighting essential information and offering simple and accessible access. immediately to other information"" (https://www.cnil.fr/fr/conformite-rgpd-information-des-personnel-et-transparence). In terms of video surveillance, it is in fact usual that the information panels, to remain concise and understandable, only include the main information on the processing, but this is on condition that they refer to the documents containing the additional information obligatory. 143. The restricted panel notes that the CNIL press release dated 2015 had not yet been updated less than three weeks after the entry into force of the GDPR. Regarding the EDPS guidelines on video surveillance, these have certainly formalized the possibility of providing the mandatory information of Article 13 of the GDPR in two stages. However, their aim was not to set new obligations in this area but to enlighten stakeholders on how to apply the GDPR in the context of video surveillance processing. Consequently, the company cannot be exonerated from its liability. 144. In this case, the restricted panel notes, as the rapporteur has pointed out, that several pieces of information required by Article 13 of the GDPR, such as the indication of the duration of data retention, the right to make a complaint to the CNIL and the contact details of the data protection officer, were not provided by the company either on the panels themselves, or on any other support or document. First of all, it notes that the confidentiality policy applicable to human resources was limited to mentioning the existence of video surveillance processing involving the processing of security data and images. The internal regulations, posted within the warehouse concerned, indicated, in a section devoted to ""entries and exits"" from the site, that ""employees must submit to entry and exit control measures"" from the site, including video surveillance. Finally, the welcome booklet was limited to informing the employee of the existence of a video surveillance system for their own security and that of property, and of the fact that each exit is subject to control. Furthermore, the restricted panel noted that it did not appear from any of the elements in the file that information additional to the information panels was provided – or made available to external visitors. As for the video surveillance installation guide, mentioned by the company in its observations, the restricted panel observes that the content of this document, written in English, relates to the internal procedure for installing and using video surveillance and that it is clearly not intended for employees. 145. Therefore, the restricted panel considers that the company failed in its obligation to provide the contact details of the data protection officer, in breach of Article 13.1 of the GDPR. In addition, the company also breached Article 13.2 of the same regulation by not informing the persons concerned of the duration of data retention and their right to lodge a complaint with the CNIL, information which was however necessary to guarantee fair and transparent treatment, with regard to processing leading to the permanent filming of employees in their workplace. 146. The restricted panel notes that in the context of this procedure, the company has justified having taken measures to comply with Article 13 of the GDPR, which does not call into question the fact that the breach is constituted for the past. 2. On breaches of the obligation to ensure the security of personal data 147. Under the terms of Article 32 of the GDPR, “1. Taking into account the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks , the degree of probability and severity of which varies, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, including including, among other things, as needed: a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data; (b) means to ensure the continued confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; \[…\] "". 148. The rapporteur notes, on the one hand, that the access account to the video surveillance software which manages two thirds of the cameras installed on the Montélimar site was common to all people authorized to access video surveillance images and , on the other hand, that the password associated with this account consisted of twelve characters, comprising only lowercase letters and numbers and that it was therefore insufficiently robust. 149. In defense, the company does not contest the breach. However, it argues that it is the result of isolated bad practices, which it attributes to the software supplier. Concerning in particular the sharing of accounts, the company maintains in its latest observations that it would fall under one of the exceptional situations in which sharing would be authorized by the CNIL and the National Information Systems Security Agency. (“ANSSI”), namely one in which its supplier misconfigured the software and made sharing inevitable. Regarding the software access password, she adds that its insufficient robustness would have been compensated for by other measures, such as prior Windows authentication to access the video surveillance software. 150. The restricted training recalls that it follows from the provisions of Article 32 of the GDPR that the data controller is required to ensure that the automated data processing that it implements is sufficiently secure. The sufficiency of security measures is assessed, on the one hand, with regard to the characteristics of the processing and the risks it induces, and on the other hand, taking into account the state of knowledge and the cost of the measures. 151. Firstly, with regard to the sharing of accounts, the restricted training recalls that the prohibition of shared accounts is among the essential precautions in order to guarantee effective traceability of access and actions carried out in an information system. The restricted training also reminds us for clarification that the CNIL was already specifying good practices in this area at the time of the controls. Thus, in the 2018 edition of its guide relating to the security of personal data, the CNIL noted, under the basic precautions to be taken for user authentication purposes, the fact of ""Defining a unique identifier per user and prohibiting accounts shared between several users"" (https://www.cnil.fr/sites/cnil/files/atoms/files/cnil\_guide\_securite\_personnelle.pdf). This requirement was recalled at several stages of the guide, in particular in the sections relating to how to guarantee proper management of authorizations and securing servers. 152. In this case, such a lack of traceability of access makes it much more difficult to account for an action on the computer system and complicates the investigation work in the event of fraudulent access, deterioration or deletion of images . Regarding the company's argument relating to the inevitability of sharing, the restricted panel notes that this sharing is not a technical impossibility but a software configuration problem and that it belonged to the company to have this modified by the supplier. 153. It follows that these facts constitute a breach of Article 32 of the GDPR. 154. Secondly, with regard to the password for access to video surveillance software, the restricted panel considers that overly permissive password complexity rules, which authorize the use of insufficiently robust passwords, can lead to attacks by unauthorized third parties, such as ""brute force"" or ""dictionary"" attacks, which consist of successively and systematically testing numerous passwords and thus lead to a compromise of associated accounts and the personal data they contain. 155. The restricted panel notes, in this regard, that the need for a strong password is recommended both by ANSSI and by the Commission in its deliberation no. 2017-012 of January 19, 2017, a requirement confirmed in its deliberation No. 2022-100 of July 21, 2022. In particular, it recalls that in deliberation No. 2017-012, the CNIL recommended, in the absence of blocking measures, that the password be composed of at least twelve characters and contains four sets of characters (lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters). When a measure to restrict access to the account was planned, the CNIL recommended that the password be composed of at least eight characters and include three of the four series of characters mentioned above. 156. The restricted panel emphasizes that it has, for several years, adopted financial sanctions where the characterization of a breach of Article 32 of the GDPR is the result of insufficient measures to guarantee the security of the data processed. Deliberations No. SAN-2019-006 of June 13, 2019, No. SAN-2019-007 of July 18, 2019 and No. SAN-2022-018 of September 8, 2022 target in particular the insufficient robustness of passwords. 157. In the present case, the restricted panel considers that to the extent that the password for access to the video surveillance software only contains two series of characters and where no additional security measure such as a time delay for access to the account after several failures is not implemented, it does not ensure a sufficient level of security and confidentiality of video surveillance images. 158. Finally, the restricted training notes that contrary to what the company argues, the authentication of people authorized to an individual Windows account prior to their connection to the video surveillance software was not sufficient to compensate for the vulnerabilities resulting from the access to this software from a shared account and using an insufficiently strong password. In this regard, the restricted training notes that the video surveillance software is accessible from seven computers and that twenty-two people are authorized to access it. It therefore considers that the sharing of the password for access to the software, which was still insufficiently robust, between all these people, increased the risk of its compromise and altered the traceability of access to the images of the video device. Indeed, the fact that all users of the device are identified by means of the same identifier makes the accountability of actions in the software little or not usable. Therefore, prior authentication using a Windows account was not likely to mitigate the risks resulting from the combination of deficiencies in terms of security linked to the sharing of the access account to the video surveillance software and the using a password that is too weak to connect to this shared account, accessible to many people and from several computers. 159. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that these facts also constitute a breach of the obligations arising from Article 32 of the GDPR. 160. It notes that in the context of this procedure, the company has justified having taken measures to comply with the obligations of Article 32 of the GDPR, which cannot, however, exempt it from its responsibility for the past . III. On the corrective measure and its publicity 161. Under the terms of III of article 20 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended: ""When the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or from this law, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and Liberties may also , if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, where applicable in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted formation of the commission with a view to pronouncement, after adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of of a company, 2% of the total global annual turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher. In the hypotheses mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 from April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted panel takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83. 162. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that “Each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this article for violations of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive"", before specifying the elements to be taken into account when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and when deciding the amount of this fine. A. On the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount 163. The rapporteur proposes imposing a public fine against the company. He considers that it is appropriate to determine the maximum amount of fine by reference to the turnover of the company in the sense of economic unit formed by the company and Amazon.com Inc. 164. In defense, the company maintains that the proposed fine is illegal. Arguing that it is the only data controller identified in this case, it considers that the amount of the fine must be determined on the basis of its turnover and not on that of Amazon's turnover. .com Inc., to the extent that the breaches were not previously attributed to the economic unit it forms with Amazon.com Inc. In any event, the company argues that the proposed fine is disproportionate in relation to the alleged breaches as well as its conduct, since it considers that it has fully cooperated with the services of the CNIL and adopted compliance measures. 165. The restricted panel firstly recalls that it must take into account, in deciding whether to impose an administrative fine, the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR. 166. Firstly, the restricted panel emphasizes that it is appropriate, in this case, to apply the criterion provided for in subparagraph a) of Article 83(2) of the GDPR relating to the seriousness of the breaches noted. in connection with data processing implemented for the purposes of monitoring activity and evaluating employee performance, taking into account the scope of the processing and the number of people affected by it. 167. The restricted training considers that the processing of employee data for the purposes of activity monitoring and performance evaluation is so precise that it causes a change of scale compared to activity monitoring methods. classics. She believes that these treatments, which allow extremely precise control of employees, for each action carried out on direct tasks, keep employees under constant surveillance for all tasks carried out with scanners and thus create permanent pressure. 168. Breaches of the principles of minimization and the obligation to have a legal basis therefore result in almost continuous and massive processing of indicators relating to all direct tasks and the performance of employees, which results in a disproportionate computer surveillance of their activity. She recalls that these treatments make it possible to evaluate the employee working on direct tasks by means of detailed consultation of the data in the tools, in order to maintain a certain pace and quality of their activity. She emphasizes that awareness letters can be sent following only one or two quality errors, observed over a week, or a drop in productivity in certain cases of less than 10% and notes that on certain positions, a “underperformance” observed over a single day may give rise to the implementation of coaching. Therefore, it considers that this processing of personal data induces disproportionate pressure on workers, disproportionately affecting their rights and freedoms with regard to the economic and commercial objectives of the company. 169. Concerning the failure to comply with the obligation to inform temporary workers (until April 2020), the restricted panel notes that it is also particularly serious, insofar as the company did not ensure that temporary workers , who often find themselves in precarious professional situations, were able to read information relating to the data processing carried out on them by means of scanners. 170. Secondly, the restricted panel considers that the company demonstrated serious negligence with regard to fundamental principles of the GDPR since the breaches relate to the principle of data minimization, the obligation to have a legal basis , the obligation to inform data subjects of the processing of their personal data. With regard specifically to video surveillance processing, the restricted panel considers that the breach of security resulting from the sharing of the access account to the video surveillance software and the insufficient robustness of the password for access to this account testifies to a certain negligence in the implementation of elementary principles of the GDPR intended to ensure the security of the personal data processed. 171. Thirdly, the restricted training notes the large number of employees affected by the breaches: at the date of the inspections, the Lauwin-Planque and Montélimar sites had a total of 2,714 employees on permanent contracts and around 3,000 temporary workers at this time. date. If the breaches relating to video surveillance only concern these controlled sites, the restricted panel considers that it appears from the documents in the file, and is not contested by the company, that the excessive data processing devices of its employees were implemented implemented on all of the company's six sites in France, which had 6,200 employees on permanent contracts at the time of the inspections, it being noted that the company used a total of 21,000 temporary workers in 2019. 172. Fourthly, the restricted panel emphasizes that the company has adopted partial compliance measures. Regarding the failure to inform temporary workers, she notes that since April 2020, temporary workers have been informed of the processing of their data implemented using scanners. With regard to video surveillance processing, the restricted training takes note of the company's compliance during the procedure, resulting from information panels that are now complete and the camera migration plan for the Montélimar warehouse, which has made it possible to remedy the problems of sharing access accounts to the old software and the insufficient robustness of the access password. 173. The restricted panel also observes that in its latest observations, the company announced significant changes relating to the processing of its employees' data using scanners. The company stressed that it believes that it is not legally bound by these changes and that it is implementing them to take into account the rapporteur's recommendations. The restricted panel notes that the changes made in fact respond to several of the rapporteur's grievances. She also notes that these measures will only be finalized during the first quarter of 2024. 174. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that it is appropriate to impose an administrative fine with regard to the breaches constituted in articles 5-1-c), 6, 12, 13 and 32 of the GDPR. 175. In this regard, the restricted panel notes that the breaches relating to articles 5-1-c), 6, 12 and 13 of the GDPR are breaches of fundamental principles of the GDPR, likely to be subject to, by virtue of Article 83 of the GDPR, an administrative fine of up to 20,000,000 euros and up to 4% of the total annual worldwide turnover achieved by the company during the previous financial year, the highest amount being retained. The company is defined as the economic unit, pursuing a specific economic goal, to which the data controller belongs, regardless of the legal status of this unit. 176. First of all, the restricted panel considers that the economic unit to be taken into account with regard to the activity linked to the processing in question is in this case the company AFL. 177. The restricted panel then recalls that administrative fines must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. It notes that the company AFL achieved, in 2021, a turnover of 1.135 billion euros, for a net profit of 58.9 million euros. 178. The restricted training considers that the pressure exerted on warehouse employees via these treatments directly contributes to the economic gains generated for the benefit of the company and allows it to benefit from a competitive advantage over other companies in the online sales sector . Therefore, and in view of all the above considerations, the restricted panel considers that a fine of 32,000,000 euros (thirty-two million euros), equivalent to almost 3% of the turnover achieved in 2021 by society, appears justified. B. On advertising 179. In defense, the company contests the rapporteur's proposal to make this decision public. It argues that the decision would contain business secrets, in particular detailed information concerning the tools it uses and their operation as well as the way in which it manages its relations with its employees. To justify this request for publicity, the rapporteur cites in particular the importance of informing the people concerned of the nature of the failings committed by the company. 180. The restricted panel considers that the publicity of this deliberation is justified in view of the seriousness of the breaches in question, the number and the vulnerability of the people concerned. The restricted training also considers that the publicity of the sanction will make it possible to inform all the people concerned of the consequences of the breaches, but also to inform more broadly any person likely to work in one of the warehouses of the company's practices. as well as the rights he has with regard to his personal data in this context. Finally, with regard to the argument linked to the disclosure of business secrets, the restricted panel notes that numerous press articles have already been published on the data processing implemented by the company with regard to its employees and recalls in any case that information relating to business secrets is hidden from the decisions published by the restricted body. 181. Finally, the measure is proportionate since the decision will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: • impose against the company AMAZON FRANCE LOGISTIQUE an administrative fine in the amount of thirty-two million euros (32,000,000 euros) for breaches of articles 5-1-c), 6, 12, 13 and 32 of Regulation (EU) No. 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 relating to data protection; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. President Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be the subject of an appeal before the Council of State within two months of its notification."

Facts and procedure 1. The company NS CARDS FRANCE (hereinafter ""the company""), whose head office is located at 10, rue Vandrezanne in Paris (75013), was registered in the trade and companies register on November 9, 2010. In 2019 , its turnover amounted to \[…\] euros for a net result of \[…\] euros and in 2020, its turnover amounted to \[…\] euros for a net result of \[…\] euros. In 2023, it had six employees. 2. The company NS CARDS FRANCE is an electronic money distributor which allows you to make online payments. The company offers two forms of payment solutions: on the one hand, it distributes, at approved points of sale, neosurf coupons using which individuals can make online payments on partner websites; on the other hand, the use of neosurf coupons can also be combined with the creation of an electronic wallet, which requires creating a user account on the website www.neosurf.com or the “neosurf” mobile application. and credit it using coupons or a bank card. Creating a user account allows you to make online payments or receive winnings. It is this second activity which is at issue in the present procedure. 3. Two control missions took place in application of decision no. 2021-193C of June 29, 2021 of the president of the CNIL in order to verify compliance by the company with all the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/ 679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter ""the GDPR"") and Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 relating to data processing, files and freedoms as amended (hereinafter "" the Data Protection Act""). On September 24, 2021, the CNIL services carried out an online check using the website “www.new.neosurf.com”. On October 13, 2021, the CNIL services carried out an on-site inspection at the premises of the company NS CARDS FRANCE, located in Paris (75013). 4. The online monitoring of the website www.new.neosurf.com (now www.neosurf.com) was mainly intended to verify the methods of informing people and the procedure for creating a user account. It made it possible to note the deposit of cookies and other trackers via the said website. The on-site inspection focused more specifically on the verification of the documentation required by the GDPR, the account creation process on the neosurf mobile application, the retention periods applied to user account data as well as technical and organizational measures. intended to ensure the security of data collected through the website and the mobile application. 5. These two control missions gave rise to the establishment of minutes No. 2021-193/1 and 2021-193/2. By letters of October 8, October 22 and November 15, 2021, the company sent additional information to the Commission services. 6. In accordance with Article 56 of the GDPR, the CNIL informed all European supervisory authorities on May 10, 2023 of its competence to act as lead supervisory authority regarding cross-border processing implemented by the company, resulting from the fact that the sole establishment of the company is in France. After exchange between the CNIL and the European data protection authorities within the framework of the one-stop-shop mechanism, it appears that the German, Austrian, Belgian, Cypriot, Danish, Spanish, Finnish, Greek, Irish, Italian, Luxembourg and Dutch authorities , Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian and Swedish are affected by the processing, user accounts having been created by residents of these states. 7. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission, on March 29, 2022, appointed Mr. François PELLEGRINI as rapporteur on the basis of article 22 of the Data Protection Act. 8. On July 3, 2023, the rapporteur notified the company of a report detailing the breaches of articles 5-1-e), 12, 13 and 32 of the GDPR as well as article 82 of the Data Protection Act , which he considered constituted in this case. 9. On August 18, 2023, the company produced its observations in response to the sanction report. 10. By letter dated September 29, 2023, the rapporteur informed the company's board that the investigation was closed, pursuant to article 40, III, of amended decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019. 11. By letter of October 2, 2023, the company was informed that the file was included on the agenda for the restricted training of November 16, 2023. 12. The rapporteur and the company presented oral observations during the restricted training session. II. Reasons for decision A. On the European cooperation procedure 13. In application of Article 60 paragraph 3 of the GDPR, the draft decision adopted by the restricted committee was transmitted on November 29, 2023 to the European supervisory authorities concerned. 14. As of 28 December 2023, none of the supervisory authorities concerned had raised a relevant and reasoned objection to this draft decision, so that, pursuant to Article 60(6) of the GDPR , the latter are deemed to have approved it. B. On the failure to comply with the obligation to limit the duration of data retention 15. Under the terms of article 5-1, e) of the GDPR, personal data must be ""kept in a form allowing the identification of the persons concerned for a period not exceeding that necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. 16. The rapporteur noted that when creating a user account on the website www.neosurf.com, the name, first name, date of birth, postal address, email address, phone number telephone number and, where applicable, bank details were collected, as well as personal documents, such as proof of identity and address. However, the rapporteur noted that it emerged from the on-site inspection that if the company had defined a retention period of ten years for this data from the last transaction carried out on the account, in fact, the accounts were only inactivated at the end of this period, while this data was kept in the production base for an indefinite period. He also noted that no purge had been carried out in the company's databases since the start of its activity in 2005. The rapporteur notably estimated that the company's letter of November 15, 2021 showed the retention of 70 049 accounts inactive for more than ten years. In addition, he considered that the company did not justify the application of the new five-year retention period that it defined following CNIL controls for user account data. Finally, he noted that 51,735 accounts were kept without purpose, to the extent that they were ""unconfirmed"", that is to say that the email address had not been confirmed when the account was created. account. 17. In defense, during the investigation, the company first indicated that it had defined a retention period for user accounts of ten years for the purposes of combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism (""MLB-FT"") ) before declaring, in his letter of November 15, 2021, that this duration was now only applied to customer contracts concluded for an amount greater than €120 excluding tax, in application of article D. 213-1 of the code consumption, and that other user account data would now be kept for five years from the last transaction carried out on the account. In its observations in response, the company also corrected the declarations made during the investigation as to the duration applicable to the retention of certain data for AML-FT purposes, which is five years in application of article 561-2 of the monetary and financial code. The company maintains that the query provided regarding the 70,049 inactive accounts would show the presence of these accounts on base for ten years and not for more than ten years. It specifies that this request was only intended to show the effective application of the new five-year retention period that it had defined. In its observations, the company provides a new screenshot which would unambiguously attest to the deletion of accounts inactive for five years. 18. Regarding the 51,735 unconfirmed accounts, the company states that the data associated with these accounts is kept for one year, then deleted if the account is not confirmed. She declares that the purpose pursued by this conservation is to allow users to have adequate time to confirm their account and criticizes the rapporteur for having prejudged excessive conservation of data associated with unconfirmed accounts, without even doing so. ask about the purpose of the processing and the retention period applied to this data. 19. The restricted training recalls, on the one hand, that the duration of retention of personal data must be determined according to the purpose pursued by the processing. When they are no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were collected, the data must either be deleted or be subject to intermediate archiving when their conservation is necessary for compliance with legal or other obligations. pre-litigation or litigation purposes. The data thus placed in intermediate archiving are there for a period not exceeding that necessary for the purposes for which they are kept, in accordance with the provisions in force. Thus, after sorting the relevant data to be archived, the data controller must provide, for this purpose, a dedicated archive database or a logical separation in the active database. This logical separation is ensured by the implementation of technical and organizational measures guaranteeing that only people with an interest in processing the data due to their functions can access it. Beyond these storage periods in an intermediate archive, personal data must, except in exceptional circumstances, be deleted or anonymized (CNIL, FR, September 8, 2022, Sanction, Groupement X, n° SAN-2022-018, published) . 20. On the other hand, under the terms of article L. 213-1 of the Consumer Code: "" When the contract is concluded electronically and it concerns a sum equal to or greater than an amount fixed by decree, the professional contractor ensures the conservation of the writing which notes it for a period determined by the same decree and guarantees it at any time access to its co-contractor if the latter requests it. "". Article D. 213-1 of the same code provides that ""\[t\]he amount mentioned in article L. 213-1 is set at 120 euros"" and article D. 213-2 provides that ""\[ The period mentioned in Article L. 213-1 is set at ten years from the conclusion of the contract when delivery of the goods or performance of the service is immediate. Otherwise, the period runs from the conclusion of the contract until the date of delivery of the goods or performance of the service and for a period of ten years from this date. 21. In this case, the restricted panel firstly notes, with regard to the conservation of 51,735 unconfirmed accounts in the database, that if the company's letter of November 15, 2021 indicated that the data of ""inactive prospects "" were deleted after one year, the retention period policy attached to this letter paradoxically provided for a three-year retention period for data linked to the ""management of non-customer prospect files"". During the hearing, the company explained this contradiction by the fact that the three-year retention period was intended solely for conservation for commercial prospecting purposes and that it no longer engaged in this type of activity. In any event, the restricted panel considers that in its defense observations, the company justifies a duration and a purpose for the conservation of data from unconfirmed accounts, namely, a conservation of one year in order to allow those affected to have adequate time to confirm their account. Therefore, it considers that the elements in the file do not make it possible to characterize a breach of article 5-1-e) of the GDPR on this point. 22. Next, the restricted panel notes that on the date of the on-site inspection, the company defined a duration of ten years, which begins to run on the date of activation of the user account. However, it notes that at the end of this period, the user accounts were inactivated but that the company continued to keep the account data in the database for an indefinite period. The restricted panel further notes that according to the company's own statements, no data purge had been carried out since 2005. 23. Regarding the conservation of 70,049 inactive accounts, the restricted panel notes that the screenshot provided by the company in its letter of November 15, 2021 was intended to illustrate, at the request of the CNIL services, "" the number of inactive accounts with a creation date greater than 10 years from October 13, 2021"". The restricted panel considers that in view of the explanations provided by the company, the screenshot produced showed the retention of inactive accounts for ten years and not for more than ten years. 24. Nevertheless, the restricted training notes that it follows from the above that when the retention period is reached, the personal data must be deleted or anonymized and that the fact of making an account inactive does not correspond to a deletion of the data personal information it contains, nor to anonymization. Therefore, it appears from the documents in the file that on the date of the on-site inspection, the company retained the data of user accounts, even inactivated, for an indefinite period. 25. In any event, the restricted panel observes that it appears from the above-mentioned screenshot as well as from the other elements of the file that until the checks carried out by the CNIL agents, the data of 70,049 customer accounts were present in the database for ten years without any sorting having been carried out between the data to be kept in accordance with the provisions of Article D. 213-1 of the Consumer Code and those to be deleted. The restricted committee notes that the five-year retention period for data other than those covered by this provision was only defined following the on-site inspection, as confirmed by the company in its letter of November 15. 2021 and that proof of its effective application was only provided as part of its defense observations, on August 18, 2023. Therefore, the restricted panel considers that the company has retained account data not affected by the article D. 213-1 of the Consumer Code for excessive durations. 26. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that the above facts characterize a breach of article 5-1-e) of the GDPR. The restricted training notes that the company complied during the procedure with the establishment and application of adequate retention periods for user account data, with regard to the various purposes pursued. It nevertheless recalls that this compliance cannot exempt the company from its responsibility for the past. C. On the failure to comply with the obligation to inform individuals 27. Under Article 12 of the Regulation, the data controller must provide the data subjects with the information provided for in Article 13 of the same Regulation ""in a concise, transparent, understandable and easily accessible manner, in clear terms and simple \[…\] "". 28. Article 13 of the GDPR lists the information that must be provided to the data subject when personal data is collected directly from them. This information relates in particular to the identity of the data controller and his contact details, the purposes of the processing implemented, its legal basis, the recipients or categories of recipients of the data, the fact that the data controller intends to 'carry out a data transfer to a third country. The article also requires the data controller, when this appears necessary to guarantee ""fair and transparent processing"" of personal data in this case, to inform individuals about the duration of data retention, the existence of the various rights from which individuals benefit, the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. 29. The Regulations do not prescribe the form in which this information must be provided. In practice, this information is generally grouped together in a confidentiality policy. 30. In his report, the rapporteur notes in essence that the information provided by the company on the website www.neosurf.com and on its mobile application via the confidentiality policy was incomplete, not up to date and only in English. The rapporteur notes, however, that the company has, since the inspections, engaged in a process of compliance, without this calling into question the shortcomings in the past. 31. In defense, the company does not contest the breach, but indicates that it has complied since the inspections. She criticizes the rapporteur for basing certain complaints in his report on informal checks at the end of which he noted that deficiencies continued on the day the report was sent, apart from any findings recorded contradictorily in a report. 32. The restricted training firstly notes that it appears from the findings made during the checks that with regard to the website www.neosurf.com, a confidentiality policy available at the footer of the site's home page was only available in English. In this regard, it notes, like the rapporteur, that the information provided by means of a confidentiality policy available only in English, relating to data processing mainly targeting a French-speaking public, does not allow the persons concerned to assess in advance the scope and consequences of the processing and is therefore not in compliance with the information transparency requirements set out in Article 12 of the GDPR. The restricted training considers that the same applies to the reference made to the confidentiality policy only in English from the account creation form. 33. Next, the restricted training notes that the home page of the website and the user account creation page both referred to versions of the confidentiality policy from 2018 and 2021, which did not mention the retention period. data nor the right to lodge a complaint with the CNIL. The restricted panel notes that given the data processed by the company, including bank details, this information was necessary to guarantee fair and transparent processing within the meaning of Article 13(2) of the GDPR. It further notes, like the rapporteur, that the coexistence of these two incomplete versions of the confidentiality policy was likely to create confusion among the persons concerned as to the extent of the rights which they had with regard to their data and the consequences of their processing. 34. With regard to the neosurf mobile application, the restricted training notes that on the date of the checks, the account creation page also offered an incomplete confidentiality policy dated 2018, available only in English, ignoring the same manner Articles 12 and 13 of the GDPR for the reasons already explained with regard to the website. 35. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that the company has committed a breach of Articles 12 and 13 of the GDPR. It specifies that the breach taken into account is the one which was crystallized at the time of the controls and that the informal checks by the rapporteur which preceded the notification of his report were only intended to draw the attention of the company to the fact that its compliance was not was not yet reached. The restricted training takes note of the fact that the company has brought itself into compliance. D. On breaches of the obligation to ensure data security 36. Under the terms of Article 32 of the GDPR, “1. Taking into account the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks , the degree of probability and severity of which varies, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, including including, among other things, as needed: a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data; (b) means to ensure the continued confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; c) means to restore the availability of and access to personal data within appropriate time frames in the event of a physical or technical incident; d) a procedure aimed at regularly testing, analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing"". 1. On user account passwords 37. To propose to the restricted panel to consider that the company had failed to comply with its obligations resulting from Article 32 of the GDPR, the rapporteur noted that during the online check, the delegation had first noted that when creating of a user account on the company's website, six-character passwords composed of three categories of characters (uppercase, lowercase and numbers) were accepted and no access restrictions in case of failure authentication was not implemented. In addition, he noted that 49,214 passwords were registered in plain text in the company's database and associated with their email address as well as their identifier. Finally, the rapporteur noted that passwords which were not kept in clear text were stored in hashed and salted form using the SHA-1 function, deemed obsolete. 38. In defense, the company does not dispute the breaches, but declares that it has taken corrective action. First of all, it announces that it has adapted its password policy in order to achieve the minimum entropy rate of 50 bits recommended by the CNIL when this password is accompanied by an access restriction measure and indicates that the implementation of these new measures was finalized in August 2023. She also criticizes the rapporteur for relying on informal verifications which would have allowed her to note that entropy was still insufficient at the date of sending the report. Then, the company specifies that access to clear passwords was due to technical constraints linked to the implementation of encryption measures for the passwords of old accounts created at the start of its activity and that day of his defense observations, all passwords are encrypted within the database. Finally, the company takes note of the rapporteur's conclusions concerning the use of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm and announces that it has opted for a switch to the SHA-512 standard, effective since July 2023. 39. First of all, the restricted training recalls that it follows from the provisions of Article 32 of the GDPR that the data controller is required to ensure that the automated data processing that it implements is sufficiently secure. The sufficiency of the security measures is assessed, on the one hand, with regard to the characteristics of the processing and the risks it induces, and on the other hand, taking into account the state of knowledge and the cost of the measures. 40. The restricted training considers first of all that overly permissive password complexity rules, which authorize the use of insufficiently strong passwords, can lead to attacks by unauthorized third parties, such as attacks by “brute force” or “by dictionary”, which consist of successively and systematically testing numerous passwords and thus lead to a compromise of associated accounts and the personal data they contain. 41. It notes, in this regard, that the need for a strong password is recommended both by the National Information Systems Security Agency (ANSSI) and by the Commission in its deliberation no. 2017-012 of January 19, 2017 adopting a recommendation relating to passwords, requirement confirmed in its deliberation no. 2022-100 of July 21, 2022. 42. By way of illustration, the rapporteur recalls that the Commission considers in its deliberation no. 2017-012 of January 19, 2017 – which is certainly not of an imperative nature but which provides relevant insight into the appropriate measures to take in terms of security – that, to ensure a sufficient level of security and confidentiality, in the event that authentication is based solely on an identifier and a password, the latter must be composed of at least twelve characters including uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters. 43. Failing this, the Commission considers that authentication based on a password of a minimum length of eight characters, made up of three different categories of characters but accompanied by a complementary measure such as, for example, delaying access to the account after several failures (temporary suspension of access whose duration increases with each attempt), the establishment of a mechanism to protect against submissions automated and intensive attempts (e.g. “captcha”) and/or blocking of the account after several unsuccessful authentication attempts (maximum ten). 44. The restricted panel emphasizes that it has, on several occasions, adopted financial sanctions where the characterization of a breach of Article 32 of the GDPR is the result of insufficient measures to guarantee the security of the data processed. Deliberations No. SAN-2019-006 of June 13, 2019, No. SAN-2019-007 of July 18, 2019 and No. SAN-2022-018 of September 8, 2022 target in particular the insufficient robustness of passwords. 45. Next, the restricted training recalls that storing passwords securely constitutes a basic precaution in terms of the protection of personal data. As early as 2013, ANSSI alerted and recalled good practices regarding the conservation of passwords by indicating that they must ""be stored in a form transformed by a one-way cryptographic function (hash function) and slow to calculate such as PBKDF2"" and that ""the transformation of passwords must involve a random salt to prevent an attack by precalculated tables"" (ANSSI, ""News Bulletin CERTA-2013-ACT-046"", November 15, 2013, https ://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/actualite/CERTA-2013-ACT-046/). 46. Likewise, in its deliberation no. 2017-012 of January 19, 2017, the CNIL already indicated that it ""recommends \[that the password\] be transformed by means of a non-reversible and secure cryptographic function (this that is to say using a public algorithm deemed strong whose software implementation is free of known vulnerabilities), integrating the use of a salt or a key"". Indeed, non-robust hash functions present known vulnerabilities which do not guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of passwords in the event of a brute force attack after compromise of the servers which host them. 47. The restricted panel notes that in this case, the passwords of users of the website www.neosurf.com must have been, at the time of the checks, composed of six characters of three types and devoid of security measures complementary. 48. It considers that such a construction did not ensure the security of the data and prevent unauthorized third parties from having access to it. The restricted training recalls that, as the rapporteur pointed out, on the day of the on-site inspection the company was processing the data of nearly 700,000 user accounts, such as surname, first name, date of birth and email address, postal address, telephone number, but also bank details (when the user decides to use an electronic wallet) or even proof of identity and address (when a payment exceeds a certain amount). However, authentication based on the use of such a password, short and lacking additional security measures, can lead to attacks by unauthorized third parties and thus to a compromise of user accounts and numerous personal data. staff they contain. 49. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that the password policy deployed was not sufficiently robust to guarantee the security of the data processed, which disregards Article 32 of the GDPR. 50. Secondly, the restricted training notes that keeping user passwords in plain text, associated with their identifiers and their email address, does not guarantee their security. This retention method implies that anyone with access to the company's customer database can consult and collect them. These user passwords, associated with their identifiers, allow access to all the personal data contained in their neosurf accounts, or even to other service accounts, the same identifiers and passwords being, as underlined the rapporteur, often used to access several services. 51. Under these conditions, the restricted panel considers that the methods of storing passwords did not make it possible, at the time of the findings, to guarantee the security and confidentiality of the personal data of Neosurf account holders, which ignores the Article 32 of the GDPR. 52. Thirdly, the restricted committee recalls that the use of the SHA-1 function for hashing passwords is no longer considered to be in accordance with the state of the art, as is apparent in particular from cryptographic algorithm selection guide published by ANSSI, dated March 8, 2021, which indicates that it is “prohibited for general use”. The restricted training further notes that in the current state of the art, the CNIL has established specific recommendations in its guide for the benefit of developers, recommending storing passwords ""in hash form using from a proven library, such as Argon2, yescrypt, scrypt, balloon, bcrypt and, to a lesser extent, PBKDF2 ""(https://lincnil.github.io/Guide-RGPD-du-developpeur/). 53. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that the aforementioned facts, not contested by the company, constitute breaches of the obligations of Article 32 of the GDPR. It notes that since the controls, the company has remedied the shortcomings noted by implementing a password policy presenting an adequate level of security, by encrypting all passwords and justifying the implementation. implementation of a satisfactory hashing system for said passwords, in SHA-512. 2. On sharing access to the customer database 54. The rapporteur notes that, during the on-site inspection, the delegation was informed that the account used for access to the customer database was shared by the development team. 55. In defense, the company contests the existence of the breach. She argues that only one employee has restricted access to the database to carry out his missions as a developer, and that a second person is authorized to access this database as part of his mission as administrator of the database. database. It specifies that the connection procedure is carried out by bastion, that is to say via an intermediate connection server which then allows access to the base, and that only access to the bastion is shared. Once connected to the bastion, connection to the database would be allowed by an identifier and a complex password of sixteen characters: the company indicates that the database administrator and the developer have identifiers and passwords separate channels to connect to the database and that the connection is filtered by IP address, which would preserve the traceability of access to the database. 56. The restricted training notes that it appears from the explanations provided by the company that the development team is made up of a single employee and that, therefore, only two people are authorized to access the customer database, namely , on the one hand, the database administrator and, on the other hand, the developer who has restricted access to this database. The restricted training also notes that the developer, like the administrator, has an individual access account to this database. 57. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that the breach is not constituted. E. On the failure to comply with the obligations of article 82 of the Data Protection Act 58. Article 82 of the Data Protection Act provides that: “any subscriber or user of an electronic communications service must be informed clearly and completely, unless they have been informed in advance, by the person responsible of the processing or its representative: 1° The purpose of any action tending to access, by electronic transmission, information already stored in its electronic communications terminal equipment, or to enter information in this equipment; 2° The means available to him to oppose it. These accesses or registrations can only take place on condition that the subscriber or user has expressed, after having received this information, their consent which may result from appropriate parameters of their connection device or any other device placed under their control. control. These provisions are not applicable if access to information stored in the user's terminal equipment or the recording of information in the user's terminal equipment: 1° Either, has the exclusive purpose of enabling or facilitating communication by electronic means; 2° Either, is strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user. 59. These provisions transpose into French law Article 5(3) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (known as the “e-Privacy directive”). 1. On the deposit of Google Analytics cookies on the user's terminal without obtaining their consent 60. The rapporteur notes that during the online check, the delegation noted the deposit of thirteen cookies before any action by the user upon arrival on the home page of the website www.neosurf.com, including audience measurement cookies from Google Analytics, which should have been subject to the user's prior consent. 61. In defense, the company first maintained during the investigation that the Google Analytics cookie was an audience measurement tool for internal use exempt from the collection of consent, before recognizing the facts in its observations in defense and to announce that you no longer use this tool. It communicates a document attesting that as of August 16, 2023, Google Analytics cookies are no longer placed on the terminals of users of the neosurf site and application. 62. The restricted training recalls that article 82 of the Data Protection Act provides that operations of access or registration of information in a user's terminal can only take place after the latter has expressed his or her consent. consent, only cookies whose exclusive purpose is to enable or facilitate communication by electronic means or those strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user being exempt from this obligation. 63. The restricted panel considers that it appears from the documentation posted online by the company GOOGLE that, on the one hand, depending on the settings chosen by the publisher of the site concerned, Google Analytics cookies may include advertising and functionalities. that, on the other hand, whatever the setting chosen concerning the aforementioned advertising functionalities, the data collected via Google Analytics cookies can be reused to maintain and protect the Analytics service. 64. Therefore, the restricted training considers that the deposit of these cookies is subject to the prior collection of the user's consent, since they do not have the exclusive purpose of allowing or facilitating communication by electronic means and do not are also not strictly necessary for the provision of a service expressly requested by the user. 65. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that by allowing the placement and reading of the Google Analytics cookie on the terminal of people when they arrive on the website www.neosurf.com, without first obtaining their consent, the company has deprived them of the possibility, which is granted to them by article 82 of the Data Protection Act, to exercise a choice regarding the placement of tracers on their terminal equipment. 66. The restricted panel notes that the company demonstrated during the procedure that since August 16, 2023, no Google Analytics cookies are placed on user terminals. It nevertheless recalls that the compliance measures adopted cannot exempt the company from its responsibility for the past. 2. On the use of the Google reCaptcha mechanism without obtaining user consent 67. The rapporteur notes that the company used the Google reCaptcha module, with the aim of blocking robots on the registration and connection page to the website and the neosurf mobile application. It considers that the use of a module without prior collection of the user's consent is contrary to article 82 of the Data Protection Act, to the extent that it does not fall under any of the exemptions provided for by this article. 68. In defense, the company does not dispute the facts described by the rapporteur, but indicates that it has remedied the deficiencies noted in the report, by subjecting the use of reCaptcha to the prior consent of the user and by not depositing any cookies or trackers on their terminal in case of refusal. The company adds that GOOGLE's reCaptcha was definitively replaced by another solution at the end of October 2023. However, it considers that in view of the difficult to read and inaccessible information provided by the GOOGLE company regarding consequences linked to the use of the reCaptcha service, it would be unfair to impose breaches of article 82 of the Data Protection Act on its client companies, without taking into account the lack of transparency and accessibility of the contractual information provided by the company GOOGLE, already condemned by the CNIL for these reasons (CNIL n°SAN-2019-001 of January 21, 2019 and n°SAN-2021-023 of December 31, 2021). Consequently, it requests a downward revision of the proposed fine amount. 69. In this case, the restricted panel notes that a reCaptcha mechanism, provided by the company GOOGLE, is used when creating an account and connecting to the website and the neosurf mobile application. She considers that it is indeed the publisher of the site - in this case NS CARDS FRANCE - who chose to use the reCaptcha mechanism and therefore allowed the actions of reading and writing information present on users' terminals. . 70. In view of these elements, the restricted panel considers that the company is not justified in maintaining that it would be unfair to impose on GOOGLE's client companies, of which it is a part, breaches of article 82 of the Data Protection Act, citing the lack of transparency and accessibility of GOOGLE's contractual conditions. Indeed, the restricted training considers that in its capacity as a company user of Google's reCaptcha service, the company is also responsible for compliance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act when using this mechanism. 71. Secondly, the restricted training considers that if a data controller can rely on an exemption from information and collection of consent when the read/write operations carried out in a user's terminal have the sole purpose of purpose of securing an authentication mechanism for the benefit of users (see in this sense, CNIL, FR, Deliberation no. SAN-2021-013, cited above), it is different when these operations also pursue other purposes which are not strictly necessary for the provision of a service. However, the Google reCaptcha mechanism does not have the sole purpose of securing the authentication mechanism for the benefit of users but also allows analysis operations on the part of Google, which the company GOOGLE itself specifies in its general conditions of use. 72. The restricted training notes that the company GOOGLE informs companies using reCaptcha technology, in general conditions of use available online, that the operation of the reCAPTCHA API is based on the collection of hardware and software information ( such as device and application data) and that this data is transmitted to Google for analysis. GOOGLE also specifies that it is the responsibility of these companies to inform users and request their authorization for the collection and sharing of data with GOOGLE. 73. It appears from these elements that the company NS CARDS FRANCE should have obtained users' consent to the use of reCaptcha, which was not the case in this case. 74. In view of the above, the restricted panel considers that by using the reCaptcha mechanism provided by the company GOOGLE without obtaining their consent, the company disregarded the provisions of article 82 of the Data Protection Act. The restricted panel takes note, as was confirmed during the hearing, that the company NS CARDS FRANCE has no longer used this technology since the end of October 2023. However, at the date of the controls, this mechanism was indeed used, without prior consent of users. III. On corrective measures and their publicity 75. Under the terms of III of article 20 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended: ""When the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or from this law, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and Liberties may also , if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, where applicable in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted formation of the commission with a view to pronouncement, after adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of of a company, 2% of the total global annual turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher. In the hypotheses mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 from April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted panel takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83. 76. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that “Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the administrative fines imposed \[…\] are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive”, before specifying the elements to be taken into account for decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide the amount of this fine. A. On the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount 1. On the imposition of an administrative fine 77. In defense, the company considers that the proposed administrative fine is disproportionate in relation to the alleged breaches and its conduct since it has implemented several corrective measures, in particular, the effective application of its data retention policy of user accounts, the establishment of a password policy presenting an adequate level of security, the use of a password hashing algorithm compliant with the state of the art and the collection of consent to the storage of cookies and trackers when required. Regarding this last breach, it considers it unfair to seek the responsibility of publishers alone when in reality, the repressive policy of the CNIL seeks to obstruct the use of certain tools such as those offered by the company GOOGLE. In addition, it emphasizes having fully cooperated with the services of the CNIL. Finally, it considers that the fine of 200,000 euros proposed by the rapporteur is equivalent to 1.8% of its 2020 turnover and is therefore excessive. 78. The restricted committee recalls that it must take into account, when issuing an administrative fine, the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, seriousness and duration of the violation, the scope or the purpose of the processing concerned, the number of data subjects affected, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects, the fact that the violation was committed negligently, the degree of cooperation with the data processing authority control and in certain cases, the level of damage suffered by people. 79. The restricted training first notes that the failings alleged against the company infringe fundamental principles provided for by the GDPR and concern many people. 80. Concerning the breach of the principle of limiting the duration of retention of personal data, the company was negligent, by limiting itself to inactivating the user accounts it retained instead of anonymizing or deleting the data they contained. In any case, assuming it were applied, the ten-year retention period declared during the controls was not accompanied by any sorting between the data to be kept and those to be deleted, as the company confirmed during the audience. The restricted training notes that this breach potentially concerns a significant number of people, the company claiming around 700,000 users had an account on the date of the checks. 81. Regarding the failure to comply with the obligation to inform the persons concerned and to provide transparency, the restricted panel notes that the company failed to fulfill the requirement to provide complete and transparent information to the persons concerned, which constitutes yet an essential prerequisite for this type of processing of personal data. 82. With regard to the failure to comply with the obligation to ensure the security of personal data, the restricted training highlights the number of failures observed to comply with basic security obligations, namely the use of an insufficiently robust password to user accounts containing, for some, bank details and password hashing using an obsolete function. The restricted panel considers, like the rapporteur, that the accumulation of these security defects by a company offering online payment solutions and collecting categories of highly personal data, has contributed to accentuating the fact that said data is not have not sufficiently benefited from the protection offered by the GDPR. 83. Regarding the breach relating to cookies placed on the user's terminal when visiting the company's website, the restricted panel considers that the lack of collection of consent concerned each of the people who visited the website in question, necessarily several hundred thousand people, taking into account the fact that the company claimed approximately 328,186 unique visitors to its website between the months of September 2020 and September 2021. It also notes that the use of the reCaptcha module of Google without prior collection of user consent concerned at least potentially 700,000 account holders on the date of the checks. 84. Finally, while taking into account that the company has implemented measures following notification of the sanction report, the restricted panel notes that these actions do not exempt the company from its liability for the breaches constituted for the past. 85. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that it is appropriate to impose an administrative fine for breaches of articles 5-1-e), 12, 13 and 32 of the GDPR and 82 of the Data Protection Act. 2. On the amount of the administrative fine 86. The restricted training first notes that breaches of Articles 5-1-e), 12 and 13 of the GDPR constitute breaches of key principles of the GDPR likely to be subject to, under Article 83 of the GDPR. GDPR, an administrative fine of up to 20,000,000 euros and up to 4% of annual turnover, whichever is higher. 87. The restricted panel then recalls that administrative fines must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. She underlines that the company NS CARDS FRANCE achieved, in 2020, a turnover of around \[…\] euros for a net result of \[…\] euros. The restricted panel notes that the rapporteur has ruled out the breach relating to the sharing of access accounts to the database and that the company does not contest the other breaches referred to in the report. 88. Therefore, with regard to the liability of the company, its financial capacities and the relevant criteria of Article 83 of the Regulation, the restricted panel considers that an administrative fine in the amount of 90,000 (eighty -ten thousand) euros for breaches of articles 5-1-e), 12, 13 and 32 of the GDPR and an administrative fine in the amount of 15,000 (fifteen thousand) euros for breaches of article 82 of the GDPR Data Protection Act, appear justified. B. On advertising 89. The company contests the rapporteur's proposal to make this deliberation public, in particular invoking the protection of business secrets to which its contractual obligations would relate under the contract concluded with the establishment issuing electronic money. 90. The restricted panel considers that the publicity of this decision is justified in view of the seriousness of the breaches in question and the number of people concerned. It also considers that publicizing the sanction will notably make it possible to inform all those affected by the breaches. Finally, with regard to the argument linked to the disclosure of business secrets, it recalls that information relating to business secrets is hidden from its published decisions. 91. Finally, the measure is proportionate since the decision will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: • impose an administrative fine against the company NS CARDS FRANCE in the amount of ninety thousand euros (€90,000) for breaches of articles 5-1-e), 12, 13 and 32 of the regulations (EU) No. 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 relating to data protection; • impose an administrative fine against the company NS CARDS FRANCE in the amount of fifteen thousand euros (€15,000) for breach of article 82 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. President Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be the subject of an appeal before the Council of State within two months of its notification."

Facts and procedure 1. The VERIZON group, whose parent company VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. is located in the United States, is made up of several branches, including a ""media"" branch, managed for Europe by the subsidiary VERIZON MEDIA NETHERLANDS B.V, located in the Netherlands. This company has several subsidiaries, including VERIZON MEDIA EMEA LIMITED and OATH HOLDING (France) SAS. The company OATH HOLDING (France) SAS owns the company OATH BRANDS (FRANCE), which has been the name, since 2018, of the company YAHOO! FRANCE, created in 2002. 2. The company VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS Inc. also has a VERIZON BUSINESS branch, which offers telecommunications services for professionals, including the company VERIZON FRANCE. 3. After the acquisition of the VERIZON MEDIA group by the American company APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, the company VERIZON MEDIA EMEA LIMITED became the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED (hereinafter ""the company""). 4. The turnover of the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED amounted to \[…\] euros for the year 2022 and \[…\] for the year 2021. It employed \[…\] people as of August 26, 2021. 5. Between June 12, 2019 and October 2, 2020, the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties (hereinafter ""the CNIL"" or ""the Commission"") was contacted by twenty-seven complainants denouncing in particular the filing of cookies on their terminal before any action, the failure to take into account their refusal when depositing these cookies as well as the terms of refusal of the latter from the domain ""yahoo.com"" and the messaging service ""Yahoo mail"" . 6. Following these complaints, a Commission delegation, on October 7, 2020, carried out an initial online check on the website ""yahoo.com"" and on the messaging service ""Yahoo mail"", in application of decision no. 2020-254C of August 14, 2020 of the president of the CNIL. 7. During this inspection, the delegation reproduced, on the one hand, the journey of a user visiting the domain ""yahoo.com"", which provides access to the Yahoo! search engine. and on the other hand, the journey of a user who registers for the “Yahoo Mail” messaging service. 8. On June 10, 2021, a second online check with the same purpose as that carried out on October 7, 2020 was carried out by the CNIL delegation. 9. By letter dated June 3, 2021, in application of article 19-III of the Data Protection Act, the company OATH BRANDS (FRANCE) was summoned to a hearing on June 23, 2021. All of these data processing operations control gave rise to exchanges between the delegation and the controlled companies focusing particularly on the purpose of cookies whose deposit had been noted during online controls, on their activities and on the governance of the processing of personal data . 10. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission, on July 10, 2023, appointed Mr. François PELLEGRINI as rapporteur on the basis of Article 39 of Decree No. 2019-536 of May 29 2019. 11. The rapporteur, on August 11, 2023, notified the company of a report proposing to the restricted body to impose an administrative fine for a breach of article 82 of law no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 relating to computing, files and freedoms (hereinafter ""the Data Protection Act"") which he considered constituted in this case. He also proposed that this decision be made public, but that it would no longer be possible to identify the company by name after a period of two years from its publication. 12. On September 5, 2023, the company requested additional time to present its observations in response. 13. On September 18, 2023, the president of the restricted panel decided to grant him an additional period of seven days. 14. On September 29, 2023, the company produced its observations in response to the sanction report. 15. On October 25, 2023, the rapporteur sent his response to the company's observations. 16. On November 28, 2023, the company produced new observations in response to those of the rapporteur. 17. On November 30, 2023, the rapporteur informed the company and the president of the restricted panel of the closure of the investigation. The same day, the president of the restricted formation sent a summons to the session of the restricted formation of December 21, 2023. 18. The rapporteur and the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED presented oral observations during the restricted training session. II. Reasons for decision A. On the competence of the CNIL On the material competence of the CNIL 19. The processing subject to this procedure relates to the placement of cookies and trackers on the terminals of users residing in France when browsing the “yahoo.com” site and using the “Yahoo Mail” service. 20. This processing is carried out in the context of the provision of electronic communications services accessible to the public through a public electronic communications network offered within the European Union. As such, it falls within the material scope of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the sector of electronic communications, as amended by Directive 2006/24/EC of March 15, 2006 and by Directive 2009/136/EC of November 25, 2009 (hereinafter the ""ePrivacy"" Directive). 21. Article 5(3) of that directive, relating to the storage or access to information already stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user, was transposed into domestic law. Article 82 of the Data Protection Act, within Chapter IV of the law relating to the rights and obligations specific to processing in the electronic communications sector. 22. Under the terms of article 16 of the Data Protection Act, ""the restricted body takes measures and imposes sanctions against data controllers or subcontractors who do not respect the obligations arising \[...\] of this law"". According to Article 20, paragraph III, of this same law, ""when the data controller or its subcontractor does not respect the obligations resulting \[...\] from this law, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and freedoms \[…\] can enter the restricted formation "". 23. The rapporteur considers that the CNIL is materially competent to control and, where applicable, sanction the operations of access or registration of information implemented by the company VERIZON MEDIA EMEA LIMITED, now the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED, in the terminals of users of the domain ""yahoo.com"" and the messaging service ""Yahoo Mail"" residing in France, which the latter does not dispute. 24. In defense, the companies did not make any observations on the material competence of the CNIL. 25. The restricted panel recalls that the Council of State has, in its decision Company GOOGLE LLC and company GOOGLE IRELAND LIMITED of January 28, 2022, confirmed that the control of access operations or registration of information in the terminals of users in France of an electronic communications service, even involving cross-border processing, falls under the jurisdiction of the CNIL and that the one-stop shop system provided for by the GDPR is not applicable: ""it has not been provided for the application of the so-called ""one-stop shop"" mechanism applicable to cross-border processing, defined in Article 56 of this regulation, for the implementation and control measures of Directive 2002/58/EC of July 12, 2002, which fall within the competence of the national supervisory authorities under Article 15a of this directive. It follows that, with regard to the control of access operations and registration of information in the terminals of users in France of an electronic communications service, even resulting from cross-border processing, measures to control the application of the provisions having transposed the objectives of Directive 2002/58/EC fall within the competence conferred on the CNIL by the law of January 6, 1978 \[…\] ""(CE, January 28, 2022, 10th and 9th chambers combined, company GOOGLE LLC and company GOOGLE IRELAND LIMITED, no. 449209, in the compendium). The Council of State reaffirmed this position in a judgment of June 27, 2022 (CE, 10th and 9th chambers combined, June 27, 2022, company AMAZON EUROPE CORE, n° 451423, at the Tables). 26. Therefore, the restricted panel considers that the CNIL is competent to control and initiate a sanction procedure concerning the processing implemented by the company falling within the scope of the ""ePrivacy"" directive, provided that the processing is relates to its territorial jurisdiction. On the territorial jurisdiction of the CNIL 27. The rule of territorial application of the requirements appearing in article 82 of the Data Protection Act is set out in article 3, paragraph I, of the same law, which provides: ""without prejudice, with regard to the processing falling within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, the criteria provided for in Article 3 of this regulation, all the provisions of this law apply to the processing of personal data carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of a data controller \[…\] on French territory, whether or not the processing takes place in France. 28. The rapporteur considers that the CNIL has territorial jurisdiction in application of these provisions since the processing subject to this procedure, consisting of operations of access or registration of information in the terminal of users residing in France during navigation on the site ""yahoo.com"" and the use of the ""Yahoo Mail"" service, is carried out within the ""context of the activities"" of the company OATH BRANDS (FRANCE), now YAHOO France, which constitutes ""the establishment "" on the French territory of the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED, which the latter contests in defense on two counts. 29. Regarding the notion of establishment, the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED maintains that the company YAHOO FRANCE is a distinct legal entity, of which it is not a shareholder, and that this cannot be considered as its establishment in the meaning of the Weltimmo decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter ""the Court of Justice"" or ""the CJEU"") (October 1, 2015, C-230/14). It notes in this regard that the site ""yahoo.com"" is not exclusively or mainly focused on French territory, that YAHOO FRANCE does not represent it to recover debts resulting from the site ""yahoo.com"", nor in the procedures administrative and judicial matters relating to the processing of personal data. She emphasizes that in any event, the CNIL could have communicated the complaints to the Irish authority. 30. Firstly, the restricted bench recalls that, consistently, the CJEU considers that the notion of establishment must be assessed flexibly and that to this end, it is appropriate to assess both the degree of stability of the installation as the reality of carrying out activities in a Member State, taking into account the specific nature of the economic activities and provision of services in question. 31. In this regard, the Court of Justice noted that ""recital 19 of Directive 95/46 specifies that establishment in the territory of a Member State presupposes the effective and real exercise of an activity by means of 'a stable installation' and that 'the legal form chosen for such an establishment, whether it is a simple branch or a subsidiary with legal personality, is not decisive' (CJEU, May 13, 2014 , Google Spain, C-131/12, paragraph 48). 32. Along the same lines, the Court of Justice has clarified that ""the concept of establishment, within the meaning of Directive 95/46, extends to any real and effective activity, even minimal, carried out by means of an installation stable"", the criterion of stability of the installation being examined with regard to the presence of ""human and technical resources necessary for the provision of concrete services in question"" (CJEU, October 1, 2015, Weltimmo, C 230/14, points 30 and 31). 33. The assessment of the existence of an “establishment on French territory” within the meaning of I of Article 3 of the Data Protection Act therefore proceeds from a flexible and casuistical assessment. 34. Secondly, the restricted training notes, as indicated in the report without being contested on these points by the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED, that it appears from the statutes of the company OATH BRANDS (FRANCE), which became the company YAHOO FRANCE , that its head office is located at 50-52 boulevard Haussmann in Paris (75009) and that its purpose is: ""the promotion on the French market of YAHOO products and advertising solutions, which includes in particular the following missions: / - prospect and develop new customers; / - maintain and maintain customer relationships; / identify and understand market trends; / provide industry-specific information to customers; / and more generally, all financial, commercial, industrial, movable, real estate, which may be directly or indirectly linked to the corporate object and to all similar or related objects likely to facilitate its extension and development. 35. Furthermore, during its hearing at the CNIL on June 23, 2021, the company OATH BRANDS (FRANCE) indicated that ""a service contract was concluded between the companies OATH BRANDS (FRANCE) SAS and VERIZON MEDIA EMEA ltd ., which provides that the first acts as a service provider on behalf of the second in order to promote the products marketed by the company VERIZON MEDIA EMEA ltd. to its French customers. (…) "". 36. In addition, and as indicated in point 1, the company OATH BRANDS (FRANCE) is wholly and directly owned by a holding company whose share capital is itself wholly and directly owned by the company VERIZON MEDIA NETHERLANDS BV, which also directly holds the entire share capital of the company VERIZON MEDIA EMEA LIMITED. 37. Finally, as indicated by the company OATH BRANDS (FRANCE) during its hearing at the CNIL on June 23, 2021, the presidency of the latter is directly exercised by the company VERIZON MEDIA NETHERLANDS BV, parent company of the company VERIZON MEDIA EMEA LIMITED, now the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED, responsible for the processing. 38. Moreover, it was also specified during this hearing that ""the company OATH BRANDS (FRANCE) re-invoices its operating costs to the company VERIZON MEDIA EMEA LTD with a margin"" and that the person ""in charge of the commercial branch of the company OATH BRANDS (FRANCE), namely the promotion of advertising products supplied and sold by the company VERIZON MEDIA EMEA LTD. (…) reports \[to the latter\]"". 39. Finally, the restricted panel indicates that in its decision Société Google LLC and Société Google Ireland Limited (CE, January 28, 2022, no. 449209, in the Recueil), the Council of State excluded the application of the mechanism of one-stop shop for reading and writing operations in a terminal. Thus, the CNIL would not, in any event, have been able to communicate the complaints it received to its Irish counterpart. 40. Thus, the restricted panel considers that the company OATH BRANDS (FRANCE), now the company YAHOO France, constitutes an establishment, within the meaning of article 3 of the Data Protection Act, of the company VERIZON MEDIA EMEA LIMITED, now the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED, 41. Regarding the existence of processing carried out within the framework of the activities of this establishment, the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED maintains that the processing in question does not occur within the framework of the activities of YAHOO FRANCE. It indicates in this regard that YAHOO FRANCE is not involved in the processing, nor in the design or management of the data processing that it carries out and does not represent it in these tasks. She adds that YAHOO FRANCE is not the supplier of the “yahoo.com” site and is not involved in relations with its French users. It specifies that YAHOO FRANCE is also not involved in the sale of advertising space on the “yahoo.com” site, its role being limited to promoting Yahoo services to advertisers. It deduces from this that the activity of YAHOO FRANCE is not necessary for the processing of the data that it carries out, so that there are no inextricable links between their two activities, and refers on this point to the decisions of the Council of State Google Inc. (CE, March 27, 2020, No. 399922, in the Recueil) and Amazon Europe Core S.A.R.L. 42. Finally, the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED notes that the broad interpretation of the notion ""in the context of activities"" retained in the Google Spain SL and Google Inc. decision was justified by the circumstances specific to the present case, in order to avoid any attack on the protection of users residing in the European Union, a risk which does not arise in this case since it has its headquarters and main establishment in a Member State. 43. Firstly, the restricted panel notes that the Council of State, in its AMAZON EUROPE CORE decision, recalled that ""it follows from the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, in particular from its judgment of June 5, 2018, Unabhängiges Landeszentrum für Datenschutz Schleswig-Holstein v Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein GmbH (C-210/16), that in view of the objective pursued by this directive \[the ""ePrivacy"" directive\], consisting of ensuring protection effective and complete freedoms and fundamental rights of natural persons, in particular the right to the protection of private life and the protection of personal data, processing of personal data can be regarded as carried out ""within the framework of the activities ""of a national establishment not only if this establishment itself intervenes in the implementation of this processing, but also in the case where the latter is limited to ensuring, on the territory of a Member State, the promotion and the sale of advertising space making it possible to monetize the services offered by the controller consisting of collecting personal data through connection trackers installed on the terminals of visitors to a site"" (CE, 10th and 9th assembled chambers, June 27, 2022, company AMAZON EUROPE CORE, n° 451423, at the Tables). 44. The Council of State also considered, in this decision, that this was the case when the activities of the establishment of the data controller consist of the promotion and marketing of advertising tools controlled and operated by the data controller functioning in particular thanks to data collected through connection trackers deposited on the terminals of users of the site operated by the data controller (point 15 of the aforementioned decision). Thus, the fact that the company YAHOO FRANCE is not involved either in the processing in question or directly in the sale of advertising space has no impact on the fact that the processing carried out by the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED can fall within the framework activities of this establishment. 45. Secondly, the restricted training underlines, as indicated in the report, that the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED markets advertising space and technological platforms available in this area. It also specifies that the YAHOO France company is responsible for promoting the products sold by this company on the French market. 46. Thus, during its hearing on June 23, 2021, the company YAHOO FRANCE indicated that “most of the employees \[of the company\] work to promote the products sold by the company VERIZON MEDIA EMEA Ltd. located in Ireland , which publishes the ""yahoo.com"" sites available in the EMEA region and in particular the ""fr.yahoo.com"" site. It also specified that these products, ""marketed by the company VERIZON MEDIA EMEA Ltd. are essentially advertising products and technological platforms allowing the distribution of advertisements on the Internet. ""Promoted by the company OATH BRANDS (FRANCE) SAS"", these products ""are present on the site ""fr.yahoo.com"" or other partner customer sites that use VERIZON MEDIA EMEA Ltd. SSP. ""It appears from this hearing that among these technological platforms are programmatic advertising tools called ""Supply Side Platform"" (platform for supply) and ""Demand Supply Platform"" (platform for demand). 47. However, these technological platforms which YAHOO FRANCE promotes exploit the deposit of cookies in their operation. Indeed, the deposit of cookies is necessary to ensure the traceability of the user's navigation over time and their reading from a page where an advertiser buys advertising space is in order to be able to offer him a set of Personalized ads based on this navigation. 48. Thus, the processing consisting of operations of access or registration of information in the terminal of users residing in France, when browsing the site ""yahoo.com"" and using the service ""Yahoo Mail"", is carried out as part of the activities of the company YAHOO FRANCE. 49. The restricted panel notes that the two criteria provided for in Article 3, paragraph I, of the Data Protection Act are therefore met. 50. It follows that French law is applicable and that the CNIL is materially and territorially competent to exercise its powers, including that of taking sanctions concerning processing falling within the scope of the ""ePrivacy"" directive. B. On the determination of the data controller 51. The restricted panel notes that paragraph 7 of Article 4 of the GDPR, which applies due to the reference made by Article 2 of the ""ePrivacy"" directive to the former directive 95/46/EC to which replaced the GDPR, provides that the data controller is ""the natural or legal person, public authority, service or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing "". 52. In this case, the restricted panel notes, without this having been contested by the company, that the confidentiality policy, in the versions available on the day of the inspections, indicates that ""We use cookies and other technologies when you consult our Products and use third-party applications and websites using our Services"", it being noted that the term ""We"" is defined at the beginning of the privacy policy as referring to the company VERIZON MEDIA EMEA LIMITED. In addition, the latter, in its letter of July 2, 2021, indicated that it “determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data relating to targeted advertising on all the domains which were visited during the verifications” and that On this occasion, it communicated to the control delegation the purpose of the cookies whose deposit had been noted during online controls. 53. Furthermore, both the company YAHOO FRANCE and the company VERIZON FRANCE indicated to the delegation that the processing responsibility with regard to the site ""yahoo.com"" and the messaging service ""Yahoo Mail"" fell to the company VERIZON MEDIA EMEA LIMITED. 54. Thus, the restricted panel considers, without this having been contested by the company, that the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED acts as controller of the processing in question, in that it determines the purposes and means of the processing consisting of access operations or registration of information in the terminal of users residing in France when using the “yahoo.com” domain and “Yahoo Mail” messaging. C. On the complaint based on the irregularity of the procedure 55. The company highlights the length of this procedure, the last control by the CNIL then the appointment of the rapporteur dating respectively from October 2021 and July 2023. It considers that the period of time elapsed between these two procedural stages has affected infringement of the rights of the defense and constitutes a violation of the right to good administration, in an impartial and fair manner, and within a reasonable time, as enshrined in Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. 56. In addition, the company contests the methodology followed by the CNIL delegation during its online inspection no. 2020-127/1 to the extent that one of the screenshots reproduced on page 14 of the minutes does not correspond to that to which the minutes refer and which is annexed as exhibit no. 25. 57. The restricted panel considers, first of all, that it is not up to it to assess the time elapsed between, on the one hand, the decision of the President ordering an inspection and, on the other hand, the decision by which she designates a rapporteur and enters into the restricted formation. In addition, the sanction procedure carried out since the appointment of the rapporteur and the referral of the training by the president of the CNIL, dated respectively July 10 and 11, 2023, took place in less than six months and therefore in respectful conditions. rights of defense, in terms of reasonable time. 58. Next, the restricted panel notes that the control report does not contain any error insofar as on page 14 of it there are two screenshots reproduced one below the other, separated by the mention ""Let us note the following display"" and that the reference made by the minutes to exhibit no. 25 annexed to the minutes only corresponds to the second screenshot. The first screenshot, reported by the defending company, does not refer to any annex. In addition to the absence of irregularity tainting the control procedure and consequently the procedure followed before the restricted panel, the latter notes that the presentation of the report and its annexes was never contested by the company after notification documents by the CNIL delegation. 59. Consequently, the complaint based on the irregularity of the procedure must be dismissed. D. On breaches of the provisions of article 82 of the Data Protection Act 60. Under the terms of article 82 of the Data Protection Act: “Any subscriber or user of an electronic communications service must be informed clearly and completely, unless they have been informed previously, by the data controller or his representative: 1° The purpose of any action tending to access, by means of electronic transmission, information already stored in his terminal electronic communications equipment, or to enter information in this equipment; 2° The means available to him to oppose it. These accesses or registrations can only take place on condition that the subscriber or the user has expressed, after having received this information, his consent which can result from appropriate parameters of his device connection or any other device placed under its control. These provisions are not applicable if access to information stored in the user's terminal equipment or the recording of information in the user's terminal equipment : 1° Either, has the exclusive purpose of enabling or facilitating communication by electronic means; 2° Either, is strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user. 61. Article 7(3) of the GDPR provides that: The data subject has the right to withdraw consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent does not compromise the lawfulness of processing based on consent given before such withdrawal. The person concerned is informed of this before giving consent. It is as easy to withdraw as to give consent. Regarding the placement of cookies on the user's terminal in the absence of prior consent 62. The rapporteur maintains that during the online inspection mission carried out on October 7, 2020, the results of which were recorded in minutes nos. 2020-127/1 and 2020-127/2, the CNIL delegation noted the deposit of at least 20 cookies pursuing a purpose requiring the user to have previously given consent, even though the delegation had not taken any action to give consent to the registration of these cookies. 63. In defense, the company maintains that it cannot be sanctioned for the breaches noted during the online inspection of October 7, 2020 to the extent that this inspection was carried out only a few days after the publication of the guidelines of October 1, 2020 , which did not give him sufficient time to become aware of it and adapt his treatment. It underlines that these breaches were committed during the transitional period of six months, from October 1, 2020 to April 1, 2021, during which the CNIL had declared that no control mission or repressive action would be undertaken, with the exception of particularly serious violation of privacy. 64. The company also contests the methodology followed by the CNIL delegation during the online control carried out on October 7, 2020 to refuse the deposit of all cookies. She notes that one of the screenshots taken by the delegation during this inspection, which is reproduced in the minutes, does not correspond to the document annexed to the minutes. 65. She also indicates that the rapporteur wrongly accuses her of registering 103 cookies during the online check on October 7, 2020, since the delegation was browsing the domain of a third party site, and not on the domain “yahoo.com”. It adds that a large number of cookies placed are strictly necessary for the provision of its services and were therefore exempt from consent while others were placed by third parties, while it has implemented all means enabling them to ensure that its partners do not place cookies on its site without complying with applicable legislation. It also specifies that after having received notification of the online report of findings of October 7, 2020, it immediately took additional measures, in particular with its partners, to ensure that consent was obtained before filing the application. Advertising cookies. It notes that these measures have demonstrated their effectiveness since no new cookies placed without prior consent were observed during the second online check, carried out on June 10, 2021. 66. Firstly, with regard to the applicable legal framework, the restricted panel emphasizes that the CNIL expressly indicated in a press release dated September 29, 2020 that if it gave organizations a period of time to comply with its guidelines of September 17, September 2020, it would continue to pursue breaches of the rules relating to cookies prior to the entry into force of the GDPR, informed by its recommendation of December 5, 2013. However, the restricted training recalls that if the recommendations regarding cookies have evolved, the practices accused of the company have continually been considered non-compliant by the CNIL and this position remains unchanged. 67. Secondly, with regard to the routes reproduced by the control delegation, the restricted panel notes that it appears from the online control report carried out on October 7, 2020 that during a first scenario, this found that at least 20 cookies serving an advertising purpose had been placed on her terminal even though she had not expressed her consent. She observed that during its trip, when the delegation visited the “yahoo.com” page, it noticed the display of a window bearing the words “Your data. Your experience”. relating to the company's use of cookies which included an ""I accept"" button and a ""Manage settings"" button. 68. After clicking on the ""Manage settings"" button, the delegation noted the appearance of an interface allowing the deposit of cookies to be configured, by purpose or by partners using push buttons, which were disabled by default. The delegation did not activate any of these buttons and then clicked on the “Save and continue” button to continue browsing. The restricted training notes that during this first control scenario, the CNIL delegation noted the deposit of 26 cookies, from which it appears, based on the information transmitted by the company during the investigation, that 7 'among them pursued an advertising purpose. 69. The restricted training notes that during a second scenario, started after deleting cookies in its browser, the delegation navigated to the domain ""yahoo.com"", in order to create an email account. Yahoo Mail "". As in the first scenario, she did not express her consent to the placement of cookies. The restricted panel observes, as appears from the documents in the file, that halfway through, the delegation noted the deposit of 26 cookies, 12 of which pursued an advertising purpose, according to the information provided by the company during the instruction. She notes that once its account creation process was completed, the delegation noted the presence of 47 cookies on its terminal, 8 of which pursued an advertising purpose, therefore adding to the 12 previously noted. In total, the delegation noted in this scenario the deposit of 20 cookies for advertising purposes. 70. It therefore considers that, contrary to what the company maintains, the methodology followed by the delegation of control clearly establishes that at least 20 cookies serving an advertising purpose were registered on its terminal, without prior consent. 71. The restricted panel then notes that in its response to the company's observations, the rapporteur excluded from the scope of the breach the 103 cookies whose deposit had been noted by the delegation from a page not belonging to the domains under the responsibility of society. Finally, it observes that all the documents placed in the file show, without the slightest ambiguity, that the delegation of control has never expressed its consent to the deposit of cookies by any action whatsoever. 72. Secondly, the restricted training recalls that article 82 of the Data Protection Act requires consent to operations of reading and writing information in a user's terminal but provides for cases in which certain tracers benefit from an exemption from consent: either when it has the exclusive purpose of enabling or facilitating communication by electronic means, or when it is strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the express request of the user. 73. In this case, cookies for advertising purposes are neither tracers whose purpose is to enable or facilitate communication by electronic means, nor are they strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service to the express request from the user, these cannot be placed or read on the person's terminal, in accordance with article 82 of the Data Protection Act, as long as the person has not provided consent. 74. However, the restricted panel observes that during the two scenarios followed by the delegation, numerous cookies requiring prior consent were placed on its terminal without it having previously expressed its agreement. 75. Even though the restricted training notes that the company has actually set up an interface allowing users to express their choice regarding the registration of cookies in their terminal via push buttons, this has not prevented the deposit of cookies even though the delegation has not activated any of these buttons. It considers that the ineffectiveness of this interface has serious consequences for the user who has not authorized the deposit of any cookie since the latter cannot reasonably think that his choice will not be respected by the company. 76. Finally, regarding the circumstance that the cookies placed without consent were placed by third parties, the panel recalls that the Council of State ruled (CE, June 6, 2018, Editions Croque Futur, n ° 412589, in the Recueil), that among the obligations which weigh on the publisher of a site on which ""third-party cookies"" are placed, include that of ensuring with its partners, on the one hand, that 'they do not issue, through its site, trackers which do not respect the regulations applicable in France and, on the other hand, that of taking any useful steps with them to put an end to breaches . The Council of State ruled in particular that ""site publishers who authorize the deposit and use of such ""cookies"" by third parties when visiting their site must also be considered as data controllers, even though they are not subject to all the obligations imposed on the third party who issued the ""cookie"", in particular when the latter retains sole control over compliance with its purpose or its retention period. The obligations that weigh on the site editor in such a case include ensuring that its partners do not issue, through its site, ""cookies"" that do not respect the regulations applicable in France and to take any useful steps with them to put an end to any breaches. 77. In addition, as it indicated in its deliberation SAN-2021-013 of July 27, 2021, the restricted training notes that if the recommendations issued by the plenary training of the CNIL regarding cookies have evolved to take into account the developments induced by the GDPR in terms of consent in particular, these developments have no impact in the present case and it has continually been considered, as indicated in article 3 of deliberation no. 2013-378 of December 5, 2013 adopting a recommendation relating to cookies and other tracers covered by article 32-II of the law of January 6, 1978, that ""when several actors are involved in the deposit and reading of cookies (for example when publishers facilitate the deposit of cookies which are then read by advertising agencies), each of them must be considered as co-responsible for the obligations arising from the provisions of the aforementioned article 32-II \[current article 82 of the law of January 6 1978\]"". 78. This deliberation specified that this is the case for ""website publishers (or mobile application publishers, for example) and their partners (advertising agencies, social networks, publishers of audience measurement solutions, etc.) ). Indeed, to the extent that site editors often constitute the sole point of contact for Internet users and that the placement of third-party cookies is dependent on navigation on their site, it is up to them to proceed, alone or jointly with their partners, to prior information and the collection of consent, explained in Article 2 of this recommendation. 79. The restricted panel also emphasizes that it has, on several occasions, adopted financial sanctions against site publishers for facts relating to operations of reading and/or writing information, including included by third parties, in the terminal of users visiting their site, in particular in deliberation no. SAN-2020-009 of November 18, 2020 and in deliberation no. SAN-2020-013 of December 7, 2020. 80. In this case, the company maintains that it has deployed all means to ensure that its partners do not place cookies through the site ""yahoo.com"" without complying with the applicable regulations. In this regard, it relies on a document entitled “Practices, improvements and governance implemented \[…\] regarding cookies”. 81. This document first mentions a management and integration program for its partners, providing in particular that they ""can only rely on the consent collected via the Yahoo EMEA consent management platform ( ""CMP""), on sites owned and operated by Yahoo EMEA, to be able to deposit or access information on users' terminals. 82. It is also stated that ""Yahoo EMEA sent surveys to its partners to understand how they handled Yahoo EMEA's consent signals when Yahoo EMEA believed there was potential ambiguity or misinterpretation of the signals that it they received from Yahoo EMEA. Yahoo EMEA excluded all partners from the sites it owns and operates if Yahoo EMEA had reasonable cause to believe that the practices of these partners did not comply with Yahoo EMEA's policies and procedures ."" This document then reports various improvements relating to cookie practices, including the reassessment of advertising systems, a strengthening of governance, the establishment of more formal and frequent control of sites owned and operated by Yahoo. 83. The restricted training notes that, if all of these measures have resulted in the company's partners no longer placing cookies without the user's consent, as emerges from the online control of June 10, 2021, they were only deployed after the first online check on October 7, 2020, as indicated by the company in its filings. 84. It considers that these measures have no impact on the fact that the company allowed, at least until October 2020, the deposit of cookies subject to the prior collection of users' consent without the latter's agreement, in violation of Article 82 of the “Informatics and Liberties Law”. 85. Under these conditions, the restricted panel considers that the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED has disregarded the provisions of article 82 of the Data Protection Act. Regarding the obstacle to the withdrawal, by the user, of his consent to cookies 86. The rapporteur notes that during the online checks of October 7, 2020 and June 10, 2021, when the delegation wished to withdraw its consent to the deposit of cookies, the messages displayed by the company in the context of the withdrawal of consent encouraged them not to withdraw their consent, under penalty of permanently losing access to their “Yahoo mail” electronic mail. 87. The company maintains that neither the ePrivacy directive, nor the GDPR, nor article 82 of the Data Protection Act precisely regulates the revocation of consent to the storage of cookies. She adds that French users had the possibility of refusing the deposit of cookies without having to give up access to Yahoo products. It specifies in this regard that it was also possible for users to revoke their consent via the main page of the Yahoo “Dashboard”. The company emphasizes that, in parallel with the practice of ""cookie walls"", no consensus exists to consider this practice as illegal, that in any case, there were alternatives to the ""Yahoo Mail"" service and that people concerned could request the portability of their data in accordance with Article 20 of the GDPR. 88. The restricted panel considers, firstly, with regard to the legal framework applicable to the withdrawal of consent, that if article 82 of the Data Protection Act conditions the deposit of cookies on the consent of the subscriber or of the user, it necessarily offers, in a correlative manner, the right to the interested party to withdraw their consent and thus reconsider their choice to accept that cookies are placed on their terminal. 89. The restricted training recalls that the ""ePrivacy"" directive provides in its article 2 (f), that the consent of a user or subscriber corresponds to the consent of the person concerned contained in directive 95/46/EC, which was replaced by the GDPR. 90. Thus, since the entry into force of the GDPR, the ""consent"" provided for in the aforementioned article 82 must be understood within the meaning of article 4, paragraph 11, of the GDPR, that is to say that it must be given in a free, specific, enlightened and unambiguous manner and manifested by a clear positive act. 91. In this regard, recital 42 of this Regulation provides that: ""consent should not be considered to have been given freely if the person concerned does not have genuine freedom of choice or is not able to refuse or withdraw consent without suffering harm. 92. The restricted panel further observes that the last paragraph of article 2 of the CNIL recommendation resulting from deliberation no. 2013-378 of December 5, 2013 already recalled that ""people who have given their consent to the deposit or to reading certain cookies must be able to withdraw it at any time. User-friendly solutions must therefore be implemented so that the person can withdraw their consent as easily as they were able to give it. Then, in its deliberation no. 2019-093 of July 4, 2019, the CNIL maintained this reminder in article 2, indicating ""that it must be as easy to refuse or withdraw consent as to give it"". 93. It should also be noted that seized of an appeal for abuse of power filed against these guidelines, the Council of State ruled that ""the CNIL which, by indicating that it should ""be as easy to refuse or withdraw consent than to give it"", limited itself to characterizing the conditions of the user's refusal, without defining particular technical modalities for expressing such refusal, did not taint its deliberation with any lack of knowledge of the rules applicable in this matter” (CE, June 19, 2020, no. 434684, at the Tables). Thus, this provision of the guidelines, which only recalls the legal rules, has not been reformed by the Council of State. 94. Finally, the guidelines of September 17, 2020 resulting from deliberation no. 2020-091 only reiterated this principle, indicating in point 31 that ""it must be as simple to withdraw consent as to give. Users who have given consent to the use of trackers must be able to withdraw it simply and at any time. This is therefore not a new direction that these guidelines would have set. 95. Secondly, the restricted training notes that both during the online control of October 7, 2020 and during that of June 10, 2021, the CNIL delegation noted the display, during the process of withdrawing consent, messages intended to inform the user of the consequences of their choice on the use of Yahoo services. 96. In this regard, it emerges from the first check carried out on October 7, 2020 for the purposes of which the delegation had created a ""Yahoo mail"" account, that when the delegation followed the route allowing it to withdraw its consent it was seen display a window indicating that the data controller ""store\[s\] cookies (or similar technology) on \[the\] user's device"" as well as a notice specifying: ""You must accept them in order to use the products Verizon Media. If you disable them, you revoke your consent and will no longer be able to access Verizon Media products, including Yahoo Mail, Yahoo News, Huffington Post, etc. "". 97. The restricted panel also notes that after clicking on the link entitled “Find out more” at the bottom of this window, the CNIL delegation arrived on a new page containing an article answering a question whose wording indicates “ What happens if I withdraw my cookie consent from the Privacy Dashboard?"" and the answer to this question specified that if ""users in the European Union can withdraw this cookie consent cookies on their behalf from the Privacy Dashboard"", ""withdrawal of this agreement will result in blocked access to our products and other Verizon Media sites and applications"". 98. Regarding the second online control of June 10, 2021, during which the control delegation browsed the ""yahoo"" domain without creating an account, the restricted panel also notes that if an Internet user could revoke his general consent to From the page entitled ""Privacy dashboard and controls (visitors)"", it appears that before the interested party completes the procedure aimed at withdrawing consent, a page appears followed by the words ""Are you Are you sure? You will no longer be able to access YAHOO or other Verizon Media products."" 99. This alert was accompanied by text stating ""if you revoke your general consent, you lose access to all Verizon Media products, including your email content, both through Verizon Media services and through third-party tools that may access Verizon Media services. Your account will be considered inactive and will be deleted after 12 months of inactivity. Please note that no content related to your account, such as your registration information or the content of your email, will not be deleted until your account has been deleted. You will continue to receive emails in your account but you will no longer be able to access them. If you wish to reuse a Verizon Media product, you will need to provide again your general consent before you can access it. If you want to perform other activities in the Privacy Dashboard (such as downloading a summary of your data) or in other Verizon Media products, please do so before revoking your consent"". At the bottom of this window were two buttons, one labeled ""Back"" and the other ""Revoke my general consent"". 100. The restricted training notes that during the courses followed by the delegation, the user is invited to express their choice regarding the registration of cookies on their terminal. It observes, however, that during these visits, the company does not provide any information to the user regarding the fact that the registration of certain cookies, whatever their purposes, is inseparable from the provision of Yahoo services, including the service electronic messaging. It observes that it is only during the process dedicated to the withdrawal of consent that the company informs the user of the fact that the use of its services is conditional on the acceptance of certain cookies and what are the consequences of withdrawing consent. 101. The restricted panel observes that if the fact of linking the use of a service to the registration of cookies not strictly necessary for the service provided, a practice which is comparable to a cookie wall, is not in itself illegal, it This is on the condition that the consent is free, which implies that both the refusal of consent and its withdrawal do not cause harm to the user. 102. The restricted bench underlines on this point that in its Meta decision (C 252/21, July 4, 2023), the CJEU sheds light on the conditions in which the consent given by the user of a service and therefore, correlatively , its withdrawal, can be considered free. Thus, in point 150 of its decision, the Court indicates that ""users must have the freedom to refuse individually, within the framework of the contractual process, to give their consent to particular data processing operations not necessary for the execution of the contract without them being required to completely renounce the use of the service offered by the operator of the online social network, which implies that said users are offered, if necessary against appropriate remuneration, an alternative equivalent not accompanied by such data processing operations."" 103. However, in this case, the withdrawal of consent cannot be done without prejudice to the user since he can no longer use the messaging service. Even assuming that the company can validly claim the fact that it has set up a ""cookie wall"", and in addition to the fact that the company does not correctly inform users when creating an account or their arrival on the ""Yahoo.com"" page because the use of its services is inseparable from the deposit of cookies, it appears that the company does not offer an alternative to users wishing to withdraw their consent, for example by providing a service paid email service. 104. The restricted panel notes that the absence of an alternative proposed by the company necessarily affects the free nature of the withdrawal of consent. Indeed, the user of the ""Yahoo Mail"" service can, thanks to this service, communicate with other people using their email address, develop their network and their virtual address book and archive important personal or professional conversations. . Therefore, as he uses his email address, the user finds himself captive to the messaging service in question, which constitutes an element of his private, family and possibly professional life and which he cannot, therefore, except he started using it, plus replacing it with any similar service as easily as he would have done initially. Users who do not wish to change their email address and renounce the content of the messaging are therefore required to renounce the withdrawal of their consent since the company does not offer any alternative. 105. The restricted panel then observes that despite the presence of buttons allowing consent to be withdrawn, these messages are likely to constitute a serious obstacle for the user who, to withdraw their consent, must in particular be prepared to renounce the use of his email address, which hampers his ability to correspond with others. Such renunciation constitutes, according to the restricted panel, harm within the meaning of recital 42 of the aforementioned GDPR in the absence, as recalled in the previous paragraphs, of an alternative proposed by the company. In these circumstances, the restricted panel considers that the withdrawal of consent to the registration of cookies is not free. 106. Thirdly, the restricted training also notes that if the company indicates that there were other methods allowing users to withdraw their consent, via the ""Yahoo Privacy Dashboard"" and the ""tab"". General consent"", it does not provide any element to this effect. The restricted training observed that during the user journeys it followed, the delegation systematically clicked on buttons and tabs with intuitive titles such as ""Your account"", then ""General consent"" or even, ""Find out more"". . Thus, the paths followed by the delegation during the two online checks are those that users are most likely to follow when they wish to withdraw their consent. 107. Finally, the panel considers that the circumstance, put forward by the company, according to which users no longer wishing to use the Yahoo messaging service could exercise their right to portability as provided for by Article 20 of the GDPR does not allow in no way prevent the deposit of cookies on the terminal, which is the subject of the right to withdraw consent. Furthermore, it does not follow from the instruction that the company offered this solution to these users when they wished to withdraw their consent. 108. Under these conditions, the restricted panel considers that by obstructing the user's withdrawal of consent, the company has failed to comply with its obligations under Article 82 of the Data Protection Act. III. On corrective measures and publicity 109. Under the terms of III of article 20 of the Data Protection Act: 110. ""When the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or from this law, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and Liberties may also, where applicable after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, where applicable in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted formation of the commission with a view to pronouncement, after procedure contradictory, of one or more of the following measures: (…) 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, In the case of a company, 2% of the total annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. In the cases mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016 /679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted panel takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83. 111. Article 83 of the GDPR, as referred to in Article 20, paragraph III, of the Data Protection Act, provides that: ""Each supervisory authority ensures that the administrative fines imposed under the GDPR this Article for breaches of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive"", before specifying the elements to be taken into account in deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide the amount of this fine. A. On the imposition of an administrative fine 112. In defense, the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED maintains that taking into account all the circumstances of the case, and more particularly its continuous and proactive efforts in matters of data protection, the administrative fine proposed by the rapporteur must be reduced and cannot, in any case, reach the legal ceiling. It indicates that the investigation period had a significant negative impact on the amount of the fine, which is now determined with regard to its 2022 turnover, which is significantly higher than that of 2020. which would have been taken into account if the restricted panel had examined the case in 2021. She adds that several of the factors mentioned in paragraph 2 of Article 83 of the GDPR justify reducing the amount of the administrative fine. As such, it specifies that the fine imposed must correspond to that imposed in similar cases, in accordance with the principles of non-discrimination and equal treatment. The company adds that the CNIL must, to determine the amount of the administrative fine, take into account the relative seriousness of the breaches, the number of people affected by them, their duration, and the measures taken following the first inspection. online and its cooperation with its services. 113. The restricted panel recalls that article 20, paragraph III, of the Data Protection Act gives it jurisdiction to impose various sanctions, in particular administrative fines the maximum amount of which may be equivalent to 2% of the global annual turnover. total of the previous financial year made by the data controller or 10 million euros. She adds that the determination of the amount of these fines is assessed with regard to the criteria specified by Article 83 of the GDPR. 114. Firstly, with regard to the imposition of an administrative fine, the restricted panel emphasizes that it is appropriate, in this case, to apply the criterion provided for in paragraph a) of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the GDPR relating to the seriousness of the breach taking into account the nature and number of people affected by it. 115. Regarding the nature of the first part of the breach, the restricted panel notes that the data controller seriously undermined the right of users of its services to maintain control of their data, by processing it without their knowledge. , in contravention of the very principle set by article 82 of the Data Protection Act which conditions such action on the express consent of the user. 116. Concerning the scope of reading and writing operations, the restricted panel notes that the breach results in the deposit of cookies by around fifteen companies specializing in personalized advertising whose aim is to follow its navigation on the web so that advertising corresponding to their behavior is subsequently displayed to them. 117. Regarding the second aspect of the breach, the restricted panel underlines its particular seriousness, the conditions for withdrawal of consent being intrinsically linked to the freedom to consent. However, in this case, its terms lead to pressure on users to dissuade them from withdrawing their consent to the deposit of cookies, by letting them believe that they might no longer be able to use Yahoo's services. The restricted panel considers that the violation of article 82 of the Data Protection Act is all the more serious as it involves users renouncing, in particular, the use of their messaging and their address. electronic which constitute important elements of their private, family and possibly professional life. 118. Finally, the restricted panel recalls that the two aspects of the breach were continually considered non-compliant by the CNIL, notably in the first recommendation of December 5, 2013. 119. Regarding the duration of the breach, for the first part, the restricted panel estimates that it lasted at least four months, between the first online check of October 7, 2020 and the finalization, on February 12, 2021, of the first measure to re-evaluate the company's practice to ensure that third parties comply with cookie legislation. For the second part, which was noted both during the first online check and during the second, on June 10, 2021, the duration of the breach ran at least until July 7, 2021, date on which the company removed the “General Consent” tab and accompanying text. The restricted training therefore estimates that it lasted at least 21 months. 120. The restricted training highlights the large number of people affected, numbering approximately 5 million unique visitors to the “yahoo.com” domain between 2019 and 2020. 121. Secondly, the restricted panel notes that the company collaborated with the services of the CNIL and that it responded to all requests for information within the allotted time limits. In doing so, the companies have complied with the obligations arising from article 18 of the Data Protection Act, without this constituting an attenuating circumstance within the meaning of f) of article 83 of the GDPR, from when the company does not demonstrate that its collaboration with the CNIL made it possible to remedy the identified violation and mitigate its negative effects. 122. Thirdly, the restricted training notes that the improvements relating to the company's cookie practices, summarized in the document entitled ""Cookie practices, improvement and governance implemented by Yahoo EMEA"", have been finalized. between February and July 2021, so that they cannot usefully be taken into account with regard to the practices previously identified, during the first online inspection which took place in October 2020 and the practice observed during the second inspection in line of June 2021. Furthermore and in any case, as indicated by the rapporteur in his response to the company's observations, updating the data protection process of users of Yahoo services is part of the management current affairs of the company, which must ensure that its digital activity is carried out legally and, more particularly, respects the Data Protection Act. 123. Fourthly, the restricted panel emphasizes that the company cannot usefully compare its situation to those of other companies having been sanctioned for breaches of article 82 of the Data Protection Act to the extent that the amount of A fine must be determined on a case-by-case basis. 124. Finally, the proposed administrative fine must be calculated taking into account the global annual turnover of the previous financial year, in accordance with what is required by article 20 of the Data Protection Act. The fact that the legal ceiling of the sanction incurred by the company would, taking into account the increase in its turnover between 2020 and 2022, have been lower if the practices in question had been examined in 2021 has no impact on this point. 125. It follows from all of the above and the criteria which were duly taken into account by the restricted panel, in view of the maximum amount incurred established on the basis of 2% of turnover, that it is justified to pronounce an administrative fine of ten million (10,000,000) euros. B. On the publicity of the decision 126. YAHOO EMEA LIMITED maintains that such a measure is disproportionate for the same reasons as those relating to the imposition of an administrative fine. 127. The restricted panel considers, however, that the publicity of this decision is justified in view of the seriousness of the breach in question, the scope of the processing and the number of people concerned. It considers in particular that this measure will make it possible to alert users, to the extent that the disputed cookies were placed without their knowledge, of the nature of the breaches in question. 128. Finally, the restricted panel considers that the measure is proportionate since the decision will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: • impose an administrative fine against the company YAHOO EMEA LIMITED in the amount of ten million (10,000,000) euros for breach of article 82 of the Data Protection Act; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication; • send this decision to the company YAHOO FRANCE for execution. President Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be the subject of an appeal before the Council of State within four months of its notification."

The TAGADAMEDIA company having spoken last; The restricted formation adopted the following decision: I. Facts and procedure 1. The company TAGADAMEDIA (hereinafter ""the company"") is a simplified joint stock company (SAS) with capital of 100,000 euros, located at 55 rue Legendre in PARIS (75017). Created in 2015, it mainly operates online competition and product testing sites through which it collects prospect data.

In application of decision no. 2022-054C of March 25, 2022 of the President of the Commission, a delegation from the CNIL carried out an online monitoring mission of the website accessible via the URL https://www. tagadamedia.com/fr in order to verify compliance with the provisions of law no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter ""the Data Protection Act"" or ""law of January 6, 1978"") and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of personal data and the free movement of such data (hereinafter the ""Regulation"" or “GDPR”). 5. This online control gave rise to report no. 2022-054/1 of May 16, 2022, notified on May 27, 2022 to the company. 6. In application of decision no. 2022-054C of March 25, 2022 of the president of the CNIL, a delegation from the Commission carried out an on-site inspection mission of the company TAGADAMEDIA. Minutes No. 2022-054/2 and No. 2022-054/3 of May 18 and 19, 2022 were drawn up and notified to the company by letter of May 23, 2022. 7. By letters of June 3 and 10, 2022, the company communicated the elements requested as part of the online and on-site checks. On July 13 and September 30, 2022, the supervisory delegation sent additional requests, to which the company responded on July 26 and October 12, 2022. 8. On October 18, 2022, a second online check was carried out by the CNIL services. Minute No. 2022-054/4 was notified on December 5, 2022 and the company communicated the requested elements on December 20, 2022. A final additional request was sent on May 3, 2023, to which the company responded on May 22, 2023. 9. On June 22, 2023, the President of the Commission, on the basis of article 22 of the law of January 6, 1978, appointed Ms. Valérie PEUGEOT as rapporteur for the purposes of examining these elements. 10. On August 25, 2023, at the end of her investigation, the rapporteur notified the company of a report detailing the breaches of Articles 5, 6, 30 and 32 of the GDPR which she considered to have occurred in this case. This report proposed to the restricted panel to impose an administrative fine against the company. He also proposed that this decision be made public. 11. On September 29, 2023, the company produced observations in response to the rapporteur's report. 12. At the request of the rapporteur and by decision no. 2023-235C of October 17, 2023 of the President of the CNIL, a delegation from the CNIL carried out an online check to verify the conformity of any processing accessible from the URL “https://testonsensemble.com/testez-de-nouveaux-produits/signup/1” or relating to personal data collected from the latter. This inspection gave rise to report no. 2023-235/1. 13. On October 20, 2023, the rapporteur's response was notified to the company. 14. On November 20, 2023, the company sent new observations in response to those of the rapporteur. 15. By letter dated November 21, 2023, the rapporteur, in application of III of article 40 of decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 taken for the application of the Data Protection Act, informed the company that the The investigation was closed. 16. The rapporteur and the company presented oral observations during the restricted training session of December 7, 2023. I. Reasons for the decision A. On the failure to comply with the obligation to have a legal basis for the processing carried out 17. Under Article 6(1) of the GDPR, “Processing is only lawful if, and to the extent that, at least one of the following conditions is met: a) the data subject has consented to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes; b) the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or for the execution of pre-contractual measures taken at the request of the data subject; c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; d) processing is necessary to safeguard the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person; e) the processing is necessary for the performance of a mission of public interest or relating to the exercise of public authority vested in the controller; (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, unless overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular when the person concerned is a child. 18. Under Article 4(11) of the GDPR, consent of the data subject means ""any free, specific, informed and unambiguous manifestation of will by which the data subject accepts, by a declaration or by a clear positive act, that personal data concerning them are subject to processing"". 1) Regarding prospect data collection forms 19. The rapporteur notes that the company collects data from prospects via participation forms in online competitions. This data is then transmitted to the company's partners, who carry out commercial prospecting operations electronically. The rapporteur also notes that the data protection policy, accessible via the websites that the company TAGADAMEDIA publishes, provides that the legal basis for the transmission of prospect data for prospecting purposes by electronic means is consent. 20. To propose to the restricted panel to consider that the company has failed to comply with its obligations resulting from Article 6 of the GDPR, as clarified by the provisions of Article 4, paragraph 11 of the GDPR, the rapporteur relies on the fact that the design of these forms does not allow users to demonstrate their consent by a clear and unambiguous positive act, and strongly encourages them to accept the transmission of their data to the company's partners for prospecting purposes. 21. In defense, the company confirms that it has chosen to base its processing relating to commercial prospecting on the collection of consent, whether for prospecting by electronic means, by post or by telephone. It specifies that the collection of ""single action"" consent is accompanied by an unsubscribe center which allows you to completely unsubscribe from all prospecting methods. 22. The company used, successively, two types of form, one based on a single button, the other on two buttons. 23. Regarding the single-button form, the company indicates that its design meant that the Internet user's participation in the game/competition was only conditional on his acceptance of the rules. The latter could thus click on the link located in the explanatory text to participate in the game without agreeing to transmit their data to the partners. 24. Furthermore, generally speaking, the company asserts that the two forms indeed allowed Internet users to make a choice relating to the transmission of their data, which would guarantee the free nature of the consent. It indicates, on the one hand, that participation in the game and the collection of consent for the transmission of data are uncorrelated, and on the other hand, that consent is specifically collected for commercial prospecting. It also specifies that the forms clearly indicate the implications of Internet users' clicks, while recognizing that modifications were necessary regarding the implications of the ""I REFUSE"" button on the two-button form. Finally, the company affirms that consent would be unequivocal because it is manifested by a click on the button, which makes it a positive action. During the restricted training session, the company clarified that the single-button form was implemented in 2015 but is now obsolete, the two-button form having been in effect since 2017. 25. Following receipt of the first report from the rapporteur, the company indicated that it had implemented a new type of form, which it considered compliant with the requirements of the GDPR. According to the company, the explanatory text is perfectly readable and contains all the necessary information for the user who does not present any particular vulnerability. She adds that the position of the buttons, by first displaying the ""I ACCEPT"" button with explanatory text in smaller characters, as it appears on the new form, would be considered ""neutral"", according to studies on cookies produced by the CNIL, and would therefore be lawful. The company specifies that it is possible to continue your user journey without agreeing to receive offers from partners. 26. In this regard, the company notes that the CNIL has not published any specific recommendations on the digital marketing sector. It specifies that it has put in place numerous measures to ensure respect for people's rights and communicates statistics revealing a very high number of ""opt-in"" people and a low number of ""non-opt-in"" people. , that is to say having requested to unsubscribe / having requested the deletion of their data / or having completed another game form while refusing the transmission of their data. 27. Finally, the company affirms that it has never intended to deceive or mislead the prospects registered in its database, the success of its activity being based on the quality of its collection practices and people registered on its database. 28. The restricted training first notes that, both the data protection policy, accessible via the websites, and the register of the company's processing activities, provide that the legal basis for the transmission of prospect data to for prospecting purposes by electronic, telephone or postal means is consent, which the company confirms. 29. The restricted training recalls that the specific consent required by the provisions of Article 6 of the GDPR can only result from express consent from the user, given in full knowledge of the facts after adequate information on the use which will be made of his personal data. In this regard, it is necessary to ensure that the persons concerned have given unequivocal, specific, free and informed consent when collecting their personal data via competition participation forms. 30. The restricted training notes in this regard that the work carried out on the practices implemented in terms of cookies with regard to banners for collecting consent can usefully serve to assess in a more general manner the conditions for collecting free consent , unambiguous, specific and informed, and serve as a reference in matters of commercial prospecting when it is based on the collection of consent. 31. Furthermore, on the same conditions of consent, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) specified, in its Planet49 GmbH decision: ""Article 7(a) of Directive 95 provides that the consent of the data subject can make such processing lawful provided that this consent is ""undoubtedly"" given by the data subject. However, only active behavior on the part of this person with a view to demonstrating consent is likely to fulfill this requirement” (CJEU, Grand Chamber, October 1, 2019, Planet49 GmbH, C-673/17, ECLI:EU:C:2019:801, §54). Therefore, it should be considered that if consent is not given without doubt, it must be considered as lacking, which makes the processing illegal for lack of legal basis. More precisely on the methods of collection, the CJEU states that ""the manifestation of will referred to in Article 2(h) of Directive 95/46 must, in particular, be ""specific"", in the sense that it must relate precisely to the data processing concerned and cannot be deduced from a manifestation of will having a distinct object. In this case, contrary to what Planet49 argued, the fact for a user to activate the button participation in the promotional game organized by this company cannot therefore be sufficient to consider that the user has validly given consent to the placement of cookies” (Idem, §§ 58-59). 32. Furthermore, the Council of State held that ""free, specific, informed and unequivocal consent can only be an express consent of the user, given in full knowledge of the facts and after adequate information on the use that will be made of his personal data."" (EC, 10th and 9th chambers combined, June 19, 2020, Google LLC, no. 430810, pt. 21). 33. The restricted training also notes, by way of example, that guidelines 5/2020 on consent, adopted on May 4, 2020 by the ""article 29"" working group (now the European Data Protection Board, hereinafter ""EDPS""), specify that the free nature of consent ""implies a choice and real control for the data subjects. As a general rule, the GDPR provides that if the data subject is not genuinely able to exercise a choice, feels forced to consent or will suffer significant negative consequences if he or she does not give consent, the consent is not valid \[…\] In general terms, any inappropriate pressure or influence exerted on the person concerned (which may manifest in different ways) preventing him from exercising his will will render the consent invalid. 34. By way of illustration and comparison, in its deliberation no. 2020-092 of September 17, 2020 adopting a recommendation proposing practical methods of compliance in the event of use of ""cookies and other tracers"", the Commission therefore recommends to the organizations concerned to ensure ""that users take the full measure of the options available to them, in particular through the design chosen and the information provided (§ 10) \[…\] In order not to mislead users, the Commission recommends that data controllers ensure that interfaces for collecting choices do not include potentially misleading design practices leading users to believe that their consent is obligatory or which visually highlight one choice rather than another. It is recommended to use buttons and font of the same size, offering the same ease of reading, and highlighted in the same way"" (§ 34). She adds that it is necessary ""to be careful that the information accompanying each actionable element allowing consent or refusal to be expressed is easily understandable and does not require efforts of concentration or interpretation on the part of the the user. Thus, it is particularly recommended to ensure that it is not written in such a way that a quick or careless reading could lead one to believe that the selected option produces the opposite of what users thought they were choosing."" (§ 23). Otherwise, the unequivocal nature of the consent would not be characterized. 35. The restricted training also recalls that studies carried out on the practices of digital interfaces, in particular concerning cookies, note the considerable impact of the appearance of consent collection banners on the choice of users, which can encourage the latter to make choices that do not reflect their preferences on data sharing. 36. In this case, it appears from the documents in the file that the company TAGADAMEDIA transmits to partners the data collected, namely the name, first name, title, date of birth, postal address, e-mail address, the telephone number of prospects, collected via its competition, product testing and survey sites. These partners then carry out commercial prospecting operations, particularly electronically, with these prospects. 37. The restricted training notes that, at the time of the checks, access to two collection forms was noted on the sites used to collect prospect data: a single-button form and a two-button form. 38. Regarding the single-button form, the restricted panel notes that under the fields allowing the persons concerned to insert their contact details there is a single button ""I VALIDATE"" on a green background with an arrow. Above this button, a text written in characters of a size significantly smaller than that used for the buttons specifies that by clicking on said button, the user accepts that the data collected will be used to send him offers from partners of the society. Hypertext links provide access to the data protection policy and the list of partners concerned. The end of the text specifies that if the user wishes to continue without receiving offers from the company's partners, they can click on a link present in the text (""I click here""). In addition, a check box is provided to accept the payment of the transaction. 39. Thus, the user confronted with this form can either check the box accepting the rules of the operation and click on the green button ""I VALIDATE"" to participate in the competition while accepting that their data will be used to send offers from the company's partners, either check the payment acceptance box and click on the ""I click here"" link allowing you to continue without receiving these offers. 40. The restricted panel considers that as it is designed, the proposed form does not allow data subjects to validly express a choice reflecting their preferences regarding the transmission of data for commercial prospecting purposes. The overall overview of the interface particularly highlights the “I VALIDATE” button which, by its size and color, stands out from the other information provided. Likewise, its title evokes more the conclusion of the user journey than a transmission of data to partners. Finally, its location and the use of the verb validate give the impression that it must be clicked to complete registration and participate in the competition. Conversely, the hypertext link allowing you to participate in the game without accepting the transmission of your data is presented in the body of the text, in characters of a size significantly smaller than that used for the buttons and without particular emphasis, so that It does not appear intuitive that it is possible to participate without clicking on the “I VALIDATE” button and therefore without transmitting your data to third parties for prospecting purposes. The consent obtained is therefore deprived of its unequivocal and free character. 41. While noting that this form was still accessible in May 2022, i.e. at the time of the CNIL delegation's checks, the restricted training takes note that the company no longer uses it operationally. 42. Regarding the double-button form put in place since 2017 until the notification of the sanction report in 2023, the restricted panel notes that, under the fields allowing the persons concerned to insert their contact details, there are two buttons : an “I VALIDATE” button, written in white on a red background, and an “I REFUSE” button, written in black on a gray background and whose font size is smaller than that of the “I VALIDATE” button. Above these buttons, a text written in characters of a size significantly smaller than that used for the buttons specifies that by clicking on the ""I VALIDATE"" button, the user accepts that the data collected will be used to send him offers from the company's partners. In addition, a check box is provided to accept the payment of the transaction. 43. The restricted panel notes that on this form, there is no mention of the consequences of clicking on the “I REFUSE” button. 44. Thus, the user confronted with this interface can either check the box accepting the rules of the operation and click on the ""I VALIDATE"" button to participate in the competition while accepting that their data will be used for send them the offers from the company's partners, or check the payment acceptance box and click on the ""I REFUSE"" button to continue without receiving these offers. 45. Like the form mentioned in paragraphs 38 to 40 and for the same reasons, the restricted panel considers that as it is designed, the form described does not make it possible to obtain unequivocal and free consent from the user. 46. It further notes that in the absence of any clarification on the consequences linked to clicking on the “I REFUSE” button, the collection of consent is not informed. The latter could just as easily mean that the refusal to transmit one's data does not allow one to participate in the competition, which is not the case in this case. 47. Regarding the new form proposed by the company following the rapporteur's report, the restricted panel notes that under the fields allowing the persons concerned to insert their contact details are located two buttons: an ""I ACCEPT"" button , written in white on a red background, and a “NEXT STEP” button, the appearance of which is identical to the first. Above these buttons, text written in characters of a size significantly smaller than that used for the buttons specifies that by clicking on the ""I ACCEPT"" button, the user accepts that the data collected will be used for him send offers from the company's partners. By clicking on “NEXT STEP”, it continues without receiving offers from partners. 48. The restricted training considers that, although they are identical in size, font and color, the terms chosen strongly encourage users to first click on “I ACCEPT” placed before the “NEXT STEP” button. Indeed, users are pushed to click on the first button ""I ACCEPT"" then the second button ""NEXT STEP"" suggesting that there is a sequencing between these two buttons, the first constituting a prerequisite for the second, while the The user journey continues by clicking on “I ACCEPT”, without the need to click on “NEXT STEP”. The restricted training notes that if explanations are provided on the consequences of each of the two options, the particular highlighting of the two buttons in the overall visual of the form, in relation to the appearance of said text in terms of font and color, does not compensate for the risk that the person goes directly from filling in the fields to the “I ACCEPT” button without measuring the consequences. 49. The restricted training therefore considers that the forms do not sufficiently inform the persons concerned of the fact that they consent to the transmission of their data for commercial prospecting purposes, in a context where the very purpose of these websites is to offer a prospect of gains that cannot suggest the objective of long-term collection of this data for such purposes. These people are not able to demonstrate their consent by a clear and unambiguous positive act. 50. The restricted body considers, under these conditions, that the company TAGADAMEDIA does not have valid consent within the meaning of articles 6 and 4 to transmit prospect data to its partners for the purposes of carrying out commercial prospecting operations. of the GDPR. 51. In addition and for the same reasons, the restricted panel considers that the consent collected via the last form proposed by the company during the investigation does not meet the requirements of the GDPR and that the breach of article 6 of the GDPR persists. 2) Concerning the transmission of prospect data to partners 52. The rapporteur notes that the company TAGADAMEDIA transmits prospect data to partners for canvassing purposes by post or electronic means. The rapporteur notes that the personal data protection policy, accessible via the company's website, specifies that the legal basis for the transmission of data to TAGADAMEDIA partners for prospecting purposes ""by postal mail or by telemarketing"" is the consent. 53. The rapporteur observes that the fact of not consenting to the transmission of their data does allow the user to prevent the transmission of their email address. However, the rapporteur notes that, despite the absence of consent, the postal address or telephone number is transmitted to partners for prospecting purposes by post or by telephone. 54. The rapporteur therefore considers that the company carried out unfair processing of the data of prospects who did not consent to their transmission to partners, which constitutes unfair treatment, contrary to Article 5, paragraph 1, a) of the GDPR. 55. In defense, the company asserts that it transmits data to its partners on the one hand, for commercial prospecting purposes and on the other hand, for the carrying out of technical and qualification operations, the latter purpose being the responsibility of legitimate interest. The transmission of database exports is done via a “registration drawing” specific to each partner. These registration drawings may or may not include a column relating to the status of the “opt-in prospect”. If the column is present, all the data is transmitted, the column must govern the use of prospect data (if it is indicated ""opt-in = 0"", the partner must not prospect on the transmitted data but will be content to carry out the technical and qualification operations). If there is no column, the prospect's email address and telephone number are not transmitted and the partner will only receive postal contact details for technical and qualification operations. 56. The company maintains that the exploitation of postal data when prospects have refused the transmission of their data is not the result of a generalized fact and that it discovered the existence of this practice at the time of the control . She adds that although certain partners have proceeded in this way, this situation does not concern all partners, is not intentional on the part of TAGADAMEDIA and does not bring it any economic advantage. 57. Finally, the company specifies that it no longer transmits to its partners, since February 1, 2023, the data of prospects who have not given their consent (“non-opt-in”). 58. The restricted training notes that the company's personal data protection policy indicates that: ""In the event of express acceptance on your part, your data may also be used by Tagadamedia and/or its partners for: • You send commercial and promotional offers by email, including of a political or trade union nature, by email, by SMS/MMS, by post or by telemarketing • Send you newsletters • Carry out a statistical evaluation of site traffic • Carry out statistical segmentation and cross-checking. The legal basis for processing is consent. 59. The restricted training considers that the purposes targeted by the company as relating to the carrying out of technical and qualification operations, namely postal standardization, deduplication, telephone enrichment, etc., participate in the carrying out of the operations of commercial prospecting of its partners. These processing operations are carried out on the basis of data transmitted by the company TAGADAMEDIA, within the framework of contracts whose purpose is, in particular with the company \[…\], “the technical integration of the TAGADAMEDIA SAS database at \[…\] and its marketing for rental by \[…\] ""(article 1 of the contract). 60. The restricted training notes that the data of persons who have not consented to their transmission to partners are entirely or partially transmitted to partner companies for the purposes of technical operations and qualification and are used, in certain cases, for purposes prospecting. 61. The restricted training considers that as soon as a prospect does not consent to the transmission of his data to the company's partners, the company is not authorized to transmit them, including for the purposes of carrying out operations. techniques and qualifications. 62. Moreover, the restricted panel notes that the company's confidentiality policy does not specify that the data of users who have refused the transmission of their data to partners for commercial prospecting purposes are still transmitted to these partners for other purposes and on another legal basis. 63. The restricted training notes that the company was only aware of the use of postal data by its partners for commercial prospecting purposes, when the prospects had refused the transmission of their data, at the time of the control in 2022. 64. It considers that to transmit this data to its partners, and to the extent that it chose the legal basis of consent for processing relating to prospecting by post or telephone, the company should have obtained the consent of the persons concerned. , which is not the case in this case. 65. The restricted panel thus concludes that there has been a breach of Article 6 of the GDPR. It notes, however, that since February 1, 2023, the company no longer transmits “non-opt-in” prospect data to its partners. B. Failure to comply with the obligation to implement a register of processing activities 66. Article 30 of the Regulation provides that the data controller, regardless of the number of its employees, has the obligation to keep a record of processing activities, provided that the processing of personal data is not not occasional. In this case, the register of processing activities must include all the information listed in 1. of Article 30 of the GDPR, namely: the name and contact details of the data controller, his representative and the data protection delegate. data, the purposes of the processing, the categories of data subjects and the categories of personal data, possible data transfers and, where possible, the deadlines for erasure of the data and the description of technical and organizational measures implemented to guarantee a level of data security adapted to the risk. 67. The rapporteur noted that the company shares a register of processing activities with the company \[…\]. However, this register does not specify which of the companies acts as data controller. 68. In defense, the company first notes that it has set up a register of processing activities and that it is a simplified register model proposed by the CNIL. She adds that this register includes all the information provided for in Article 30 of the GDPR. 69. She adds that it is relatively rare for the CNIL to sanction organizations on the basis of Article 30 of the GDPR and that the decisions targeting this breach would concern more serious facts (total absence of register, lack of compliance after formal notice, etc.). 70. The restricted panel notes that the company TAGADAMEDIA implements a register of processing activities, held jointly with the company \[…\], acquired by it, for processing relating to human resources or prospecting activities. 71. The restricted panel notes that the said register does not distinguish which company acts as data controller for the activity in question. Indeed, it is not specified for human resources or prospecting activities whether it is the TAGADAMEDIA company or the company \[…\] which acts as data controller. However, the company TAGADAMEDIA should have, given the number of data processed and its activity, ensured that its register of processing activities was exhaustive, precise and up to date. 72. It follows from the above that the breach of Article 30 of the GDPR is characterized. 73. The restricted panel notes that the company has updated its register of processing activities which now complies with the requirements of the GDPR. C. On the failure to comply with the obligation to ensure the security of personal data 74. Article 32(1) of the GDPR provides that ""Taking into account the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks , the degree of probability and severity of which varies, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee a level of security adapted to the risk \[… \] "" and in particular "" means to guarantee the constant confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services "" and a "" procedure aimed at regularly testing, analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing"". 75. The rapporteur notes that as part of the on-site inspection carried out on May 19, 2022, the company indicated that “there is a single database administrator account. It is shared by Mr \[…\] and the technical director "". It considers that this practice does not comply with security requirements and recalls that in accordance with the basic rules relating to the security of information systems, to be effective, a password must remain secret and individual. However, the use of non-individual accounts does not make it possible to precisely identify connections and trace the uses and actions carried out by people with access to the administrator account. 76. In defense, the company claims that authentication and access to the database are made possible via two authentication steps: a VPN connection using an individual authentication key and a second authentication step to the administration account shared between the two authorized employees. The VPN connection is made through a process of editing individual authentication keys, the keys not being shared between employees. 77. She adds that the rapporteur's arguments are not relevant given the size and structure of TAGADAMEDIA. 78. The restricted training considers that connecting to the VPN using individual authentication keys constitutes good practice and that it allows, given the limited number of people accessing the administration account and their quality, to impute access and actions carried out within the database by a shared administrator account if necessary. 79. The restricted panel concludes, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, that the company had implemented appropriate technical measures in order to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk. 80. It follows from the above that there is no breach of Article 32 of the GDPR. II. On the pronouncement of corrective measures 81. Article 20 of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended provides that: ""when the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27 2016 or this law, the president of the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties may \[…\] refer the matter to the restricted formation of the commission with a view to pronouncing, after adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures : \[…\]2° An injunction to bring the processing into compliance with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or this law or to satisfy requests presented by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights, which may be accompanied, except in cases where the processing is implemented by the State, with a penalty the amount of which cannot exceed €100,000 per day of delay from the date set by the training restricted; \[…\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the figure total global annual sales for the previous financial year, whichever is greater. In the hypotheses mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted panel takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83. 82. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that: ""Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the administrative fines imposed under this article for violations of this regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each cases, effective, proportionate and dissuasive"", before specifying the elements to be taken into account when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and when deciding the amount of this fine. 83. The company indicates that it considers that the amount proposed by the rapporteur, of five hundred thousand euros, is not proportionate to the seriousness of the alleged facts. The company refers to the EDPS Guidelines 04/2022 of May 12, 2022 on the calculation of the amount of administrative fines. In light of these guidelines, it recalls that the processing undertaken does not involve any particular sensitivity, that the processing is not cross-border, that the damage suffered by the prospects is not substantial and that it has not did not want to mislead prospects in the context of data collection. 84. Firstly, the restricted committee recalls that it must take into account, when issuing an administrative fine, the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, seriousness and duration of the violation. , the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and the categories of personal data affected by the violation. 85. Concerning the obligation to have a legal basis for the processing carried out, the restricted training firstly emphasizes the fact that the ecosystem of the resale of data from partners to partners requires particularly guarantees. strong as to the quality and validity of the consent obtained by the first data collector and which the partners rely on for commercial prospecting purposes. It recalls that the absence of obtaining valid consent deprives the transmission of prospect data to partners of a legal basis, which therefore appears unlawful. It considers that the requirements must be particularly strengthened with regard to the methods of obtaining the consent of users of websites published by the company, the purpose of which is to offer prospects of earning, these people not necessarily being aware of the scope of their agreement as part of their registration. She also points out that the company's lead database has approximately six million leads. 86. The restricted training also notes that, by transmitting prospect data to its partners for the purposes of technical operations and qualification while this processing falls within the scope of commercial prospecting and the persons concerned have not specifically consented to this transmission, the TAGADEMEDIA company did not have a legal basis. The restricted training notes that the company has stopped this practice. 87. Regarding the failure to comply with the obligation to implement a register of processing activities, the restricted panel considers that even if this failure is of low seriousness, the imposition of a fine appears justified. 88. In view of all of these elements, the restricted panel considers that it is appropriate to impose an administrative fine for the breaches of Articles 6 and 30 of the GDPR. 89. Secondly, with regard to the amount of the administrative fine, the restricted committee recalls that certain violations of the GDPR noted involve breaches of principles likely to be subject, under Article 83 of the GDPR, to a fine of up to 20,000,000 euros or up to 4% of the global annual turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher. 90. It considers that the activity of the company and its financial situation must in particular be taken into account. 91. Therefore, with regard to the liability of the company, its financial capacities, its cooperation during the procedure and the relevant criteria of Article 83(2) of the GDPR, the restricted panel considers that a fine of seventy-five thousand euros appears justified. 92. Thirdly, with regard to the issuance of an injunction, the restricted panel notes that the consent collected via the collection form proposed by the company as part of its first observations and referred to in paragraphs 47 and 48 does not still does not present a unambiguous character. The restricted panel considers that it is necessary to issue an injunction on this point. 93. In view of these elements, the restricted panel considers justified the imposition of a penalty in the amount of one thousand (1,000) euros per day of delay and payable after a period of one month. 94. Fourth, with regard to the publicity of the sanction, the company raises the disastrous consequences for its reputation by designating it as a negligent actor even though it is truly invested in respecting GDPR standards. This advertising would impact both its reputation with its economic partners and Internet users. She therefore requests that the decision not be made public or, failing that, that it be made anonymous within fifteen days of publication. 95. The restricted panel considers that the publicity of this decision is justified in view of the seriousness of some of the breaches in question, the scope of the processing and the number of people concerned, i.e. approximately 6 million prospects. 96. It also notes that this measure will make it possible to inform the people concerned by the company's prospecting operations. This information will allow them, if necessary, to assert their rights with the company. 97. Finally, it considers that this measure is proportionate since the decision will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: • impose an administrative fine against the company TAGADAMEDIA in the amount of seventy-five thousand (€75,000) for breaches of Articles 6 and 30 of the GDPR; • issue an injunction against the company TAGADAMEDIA to implement on the sites it publishes a form for collecting prospect data making it possible to collect free, specific, informed and unequivocal consent regarding the transmission of their data of a personal nature to partners for prospecting purposes; • attach the injunction to a penalty of one thousand (1,000) euros per day of delay at the end of a period of one month following notification of this deliberation, proof of compliance must be sent to restricted training within this period; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer allow the company to be identified by name after a period of two years from its publication. President Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be the subject of an appeal before the Council of State within two months of its notification."

Basis for the referral: Article 10, V. of Law No. 2023-380 of May 19, 2023 relating to the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games and containing various other provisions The essential : The draft decree, taken in application of article 10 of the law relating to the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games which introduces the possibility of implementing “augmented” camera devices, aims to list the predetermined events that an algorithmic processing may aim to detect. The system considered is broken down into three phases: design phase, operation phase and improvement and correction phase. Furthermore, the CNIL recalls that, both for the design phase and for the operation phase, informing people is an essential element to ensure the fairness of processing with the aim of transparency towards the public. This is why it recommends in particular that the exemptions from the right to information provided for during the exploitation phase be particularly limited and specified in the draft decree. Finally, the CNIL notes that the ministry has carried out, as provided for by law, an abstract impact study relating to data protection (AIPD) of the risks and advantages of the devices which will be tested. She emphasizes that these impact studies must be completed when the systems are chosen and put in place, before their operational deployment. THE NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR COMPUTING AND FREEDOMS, Submission by the Minister of the Interior of a request for an opinion concerning a draft decree relating to the modalities of implementation of algorithmic processing on images collected by means of video protection systems and cameras installed on aircraft, taken into account application of article 10 of law no. 2023-380 of May 19, 2023 relating to the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games and containing various other provisions; Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing the Directive 95/46/EC (general data protection regulation or GDPR); Considering law no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended relating to data processing, files and freedoms; Considering the internal security code, in particular its articles L. 251-1 to L. 255-1, L. 242-1 to L. 242-8, L. 722-1; Considering article 10 of Law No. 2023-380 of May 19, 2023 relating to the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games and containing various other provisions; After having heard the report of Mr. Claude CASTELLUCCIA, commissioner, and the observations of Mr. Benjamin TOUZANNE, Government commissioner, ADOPTS THE FOLLOWING DELIBERATION: I- The referral A. The context Law No. 2023-380 relating to the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games and containing various other provisions was promulgated on May 19, 2023 (hereinafter the “Law”). Its article 10 establishes an experimental framework allowing the implementation of algorithmic processing for automated analysis of images coming from video protection devices and cameras installed on aircraft in order to detect and report predetermined events in real time. These treatments cannot be implemented: that for the sole purpose of ensuring the security of sporting, recreational or cultural events which, by the scale of their attendance or by their circumstances, are particularly exposed to the risk of acts of terrorism or serious attacks on peoples' security ; only by the national police and gendarmerie services, the fire and rescue services, the municipal police services and the internal security services of the SNCF and the RATP within the framework of their respective missions, which will assume the quality of data controllers. The CNIL ruled on December 8, 2022 in its deliberation no. 2022-118 on this bill; it noted in particular that the use of these devices raises new and substantial issues in terms of privacy, but nevertheless considered that the guarantees provided make it possible to limit the risks of harm to data and the private lives of individuals and are in line with the meaning of the recommendations formulated in its position on “augmented” cameras published in July 2022. In its decision of May 17, 2023, the Constitutional Council judged article 10 of the law to be consistent with the Constitution - with a reservation of interpretation - in that it disregards neither the freedom to come and go, nor the principle of safeguarding the dignity of the human person, nor the freedom of collective expression of ideas and opinions, nor the right to security, nor the principle of equality before the law, nor any other constitutional requirement. B. The subject of the referral V of article 10 of the law provides that the use of algorithmic processing, referred to in I of the same article, must be authorized by a decree, taken after consulting the CNIL. This decree must set the essential characteristics of the processing and indicate in particular ""the predetermined events that the processing is intended to signal, where applicable the specificities of the situations justifying its use, the services mentioned in the same I likely to implement it, the possible conditions of their financial participation in the use of the treatment and the conditions of authorization and training of the agents who can access the treatment reports"". It is in this context that the CNIL was informed by the Ministry of the Interior and Overseas of this draft decree. It appears from the draft decree that the use of algorithmic processing is broken down into several phases: The design phase: in accordance with article 4 of the draft decree, this phase must make it possible to identify indicators and relevance criteria characterizing predetermined events likely to present or reveal a risk of acts of terrorism or serious attacks on personal safety. During this phase, configuration can be carried out on the images coming from video protection devices and cameras installed on aircraft with the aim of adapting the algorithm to real conditions of use. As such, the CNIL requests that the wording of article 4 of the draft decree be clarified to be more understandable and accessible. It takes note of the Government's desire to add a new purpose aimed at ""configuring tools allowing the detection and reporting in real time, from these images, of predetermined events"". Processing for design purposes is implemented by the State or by a subcontractor in accordance with the provisions of Chapter II of the draft decree. The State, however, has the possibility of acquiring algorithmic solutions which have already been the subject of a design phase by a third-party solution provider. In this hypothesis, article 11 of the draft decree provides that the State must ensure that the processing has been designed in compliance with the requirements of VI of article 10 of the law. The operation phase: the authorized services implement algorithmic processing in order to detect and report predetermined events in real time under the conditions provided for in Chapter IV of the draft decree. This is a warning, the devices cannot be the basis for an individual decision or prosecution. The improvement and correction phase: if during the operation phase, a need is identified to improve the quality of detection of predetermined events, the biases or errors can be corrected under the conditions provided for in Chapter II of the draft decree. The provisions of the draft decree call for the following observations. II- The opinion of the CNIL A. On the general provisions On predetermined events Article 3 of the draft decree lists the predetermined events that algorithmic processing, referred to in I of Article 10 of the law, is authorized to detect. The CNIL notes that this article clearly provides, in accordance with the aforementioned decision of the Constitutional Council, that such events can only be detected in that they are likely to present or reveal a risk of an act of terrorism or serious threat to personal safety. The list of predetermined events in article 3 of the draft decree is restrictive such that no algorithmic processing can be designed, acquired by the State or implemented in the operational phase to detect other events. than those listed there. The predetermined events listed in article 3 appear relevant in the context of the experiment. Their definition calls for the following observations: Firstly, the CNIL notes that the detection of abandoned objects only aims to identify the abandonment of these objects and therefore does not make it possible to track individuals. Secondly, with regard to the detection of ""non-compliance with the direction of traffic by a person"", the CNIL considers that this use case only applies in the hypothesis where a direction of traffic would be imposed on the people. It takes note of the Government's commitment to complete the decree in this regard. Thirdly, the CNIL considers that the detection of a person on the ground should only concern cases where they have fallen, whatever the cause (for example an accident, discomfort or shock), and not cases where a person sits on the ground continuously. It takes note of the Government's commitment to clarify the decree in this regard. Subject to the reservations stated above, the CNIL considers that the list of predetermined events falls within the framework of the law. On common guarantees Article 2 of the draft decree recalls the guarantees provided by law: processing operations cannot use any biometric data or any facial recognition technique, they cannot carry out any reconciliation, interconnection or automated linking with other processing operations. or even base, by themselves, any individual decision or automated prosecution. The CNIL takes note of the Government's commitment that the processing will not allow the tracking or re-identification of people, even using data other than biometric (for example through clothing recognition). The CNIL once again emphasizes the importance of these guarantees, as the Constitutional Council did in its aforementioned decision, indicating that ""if such processing has neither the aim nor the effect of modifying the conditions in which these images are collected, it nevertheless carries out a systematic and automated analysis of these images likely to considerably increase the number and precision of the information which can be extracted from them. Therefore, the implementation of such surveillance systems must be accompanied by specific guarantees likely to safeguard the right to respect for private life. B. On the implementation of processing during the design phase when the latter is carried out by the State or on its behalf On the legal regime applicable during the design phase The Government specified that having regard to the purposes pursued: processing for algorithm design purposes falls under the GDPR; the processing implemented as part of the exploitation phase falls under Title III of the “data processing and freedoms” law concerning the provisions applicable to processing covered by the “police-justice” directive, with the exception of those implemented implemented by fire and rescue services which are governed by the GDPR. The CNIL notes in this regard that a decision of the Council of State no. 451653 of July 22, 2022, considered that the processing implemented in this case during the design and learning phase of a system of artificial intelligence responded to the same legal regime (namely Title III of the “Informatics and Liberties” law) as those implemented during the exploitation phase of the system on the grounds that the tools thus designed were aimed exclusively at research of criminal offenses. The Council of State thus seems to consider that the operational use of algorithmic processing in the operating phase being precisely identified from the design phase, the processing operations carried out in the two phases satisfy one and the same overall purpose and must fall under the same regime. legal. The CNIL, however, takes note of the Government's position considering that the design phase of algorithmic processing will be unique, regardless of who is responsible for the processing in the operating phase and that it cannot be determined during this design phase of the algorithmic processing. whether it will ultimately be used by competent authorities within the meaning of Title III of the “information technology and freedoms” law during the exploitation phase. On the guarantees implemented and security measures Paragraph VI of Article 10 of the law provides that the processing must meet a certain number of requirements (on the data used to train the algorithms, on the implementation of traceability measures, prevention of bias, on the terms of interruption of treatment at any time etc.). In this regard, article 6 of the draft decree provides that only the requirements provided for in the second to fifth paragraphs of VI of article 10 of the law are applicable to the design phase. However, and in accordance with VI of Article 10 of the law, all of the requirements provided for in the same VI (paragraph 1° to 5° inclusive) are applicable to treatments acquired or designed by the State directly or on its behalf. The CNIL takes note of the Government's commitment to modify the draft decree to this effect. Finally, the CNIL requests that the data processed as part of the design phase be systematically subject to pseudonymization or blurring operations when such operations do not compromise the technical quality of the processing. The CNIL notes the Government's commitment to follow this request as far as possible. On the information of the persons concerned Informing people is an essential element to ensure the fairness of processing with the aim of transparency, right from the design phase of algorithmic processing. Article 10 of the draft decree provides, for the design phase, information for the persons concerned on the basis of Article 14 of the GDPR. The CNIL insists on the need, for the Ministry of the Interior as data controller during this phase, to provide the persons concerned, at least on its website, with all the information referred to in Article 14 of the GDPR and particularly the location, date of the event filmed and the purpose of reusing the images. The CNIL emphasizes the usefulness of anticipating, as much as possible, the identification of events for which images from video protection devices and cameras installed on aircraft could be useful in the design of algorithms. Indeed, in this hypothesis the persons concerned could be informed in advance, by the data controllers having implemented these video protection devices or these cameras installed on aircraft, in accordance with article 13.3 of the GDPR, of the reuse, by the Ministry of the Interior, images concerning them for the purposes of designing algorithmic processing. Such anticipation and the prior nature of the information given to people would ensure better transparency and loyalty towards the public. In this hypothesis, if the Government would not be required to inform people in accordance with article 14.5.a) of the GDPR, the CNIL recommends that it provide people with general information containing at least the place and date of the events. concerned and the purpose of the reuse. In any case, the CNIL insists on the need to provide understandable and accessible information in order to enable the persons concerned to become aware of the precise conditions under which their data may be collected and for what purposes. C. On the implementation of treatments during the operating phase On buyers Article 15 of the draft decree lists the agents of the various services responsible for processing who are authorized to access reports of the algorithmic processing implemented. If only individually designated and specially authorized agents within the limits of their need to know will be able to access these reports, in practice, the number of these accessors could quickly increase. In this regard, taking into account the innovative nature and high technicality of these algorithmic treatments, the risks that they may inherently imply for individual freedoms and their unprecedented deployment in real conditions, the CNIL recommends: to limit the number of authorizations granted to what is strictly necessary, for example by raising the level of authorization; to expand the training of agents for the purposes of being authorized, provided for in II of article 15 of the draft decree, at least in the operational and technical functioning of the tool made available. The CNIL takes note of the Government's commitment to clarify the draft decree in this regard; to provide a doctrine for the use of algorithmic processing to the services responsible for processing and to authorized agents. If the content of the training cannot be defined in the decree, the CNIL considers in the state of the project that the requirement of V of article 10 of the law according to which the decree must indicate ""the conditions of authorization and training of agents who can access processing reports"" is not entirely satisfied. Indeed, these training methods present major challenges given the unprecedented nature of the deployment of these systems. Finally, III of Article 15 of the draft decree provides that “processing reports are subject to control by staff responsible for supervising the implementation of the processing”. This provision is particularly imprecise, particularly as to the type of control carried out, their purpose and the personnel targeted. The CNIL notes the Government's commitment to specify the nature of the control in the draft decree. On possible access to data outside the European Union It appears from the opinion of the ministry's data protection delegate on the AIPD transmitted by the Government that: for processing covered by Title III of the “information technology and freedoms” law, no transfer of data outside the European Union is authorized in accordance with the regulations; for processing subject to the GDPR, transfers of personal data outside the European Union may take place in the event of hosting of the algorithm or the data resulting from it (processing carried out outside the EU by a subcontractor) or via the use of a subcontractor located in the EU but subject to third-party extraterritorial law (access in the event of data requisition by foreign authorities). This opinion indicates in this regard that it will be necessary to add to the AIPD a firm warning against the risks of transfer or potential transfer without appropriate guarantees. The CNIL considers that this warning alone cannot be sufficient and recalls that: possible transfers of data to a country not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission cannot take place without being strictly supervised by appropriate guarantees or justified with regard to the exemptions authorized by Article 49 of the GDPR. In the absence of such guarantees, these transfers cannot take place; those responsible for algorithmic processing using a subcontractor subject to third-party extraterritorial law must ensure that the latter provides sufficient guarantees in accordance with Article 28 of the GDPR, in particular by checking whether local legislation and practices are likely to allow foreign authorities to access data stored on the territory of the European Union. In any case, the CNIL strongly recommends, given the sensitivity and unprecedented nature of the algorithmic processing envisaged, that no transfer of data outside the EU or access to data by foreign authorities can take place, as long as both in the design and operational phases. On the information of the persons concerned As the CNIL recalled in its deliberation on the bill on the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, informing people “is essential to allow the deployment of “augmented” camera devices in a climate of confidence in the with regard to public authorities. In this regard, public information is provided for in Article 17 of the draft decree (in application of Articles 104 of the “Informatics and Freedoms” law or 14 of the GDPR depending on the deployment considered and the applicable legal regime). However, these articles are applicable in cases where the personal data would not have been Furthermore, the CNIL recalls, as it explained in its July 2022 position on the conditions for deployment of “augmented” cameras that, if it is necessary for this information to be provided in clear and simple terms in accordance with the GDPR and the “information technology and freedoms” law, such information will not be sufficient. Indeed, this will have to be adapted to the contactless and innovative nature of these technologies. Therefore, a simple update of the display panels of a video protection or drone system is not enough. It will be essential to bring to the attention of those concerned the central information of the system, which resides in the ""augmented"" nature of the cameras and also to explain the characteristics and scope of such an analysis. The CNIL therefore strongly emphasizes the need to systematically provide information methods directly at the locations where images are captured and on suitable media (dedicated information panels, videos, QR codes, ground markings, sound announcements, etc.). ). Finally, when the State acquires an algorithmic solution from a third-party supplier, the CNIL recommends that information be provided on this acquisition in order to allow the persons concerned to become aware of the conditions under which the algorithm was designed. If the law provides for the possibility of excluding information from individuals in cases where such information would conflict with the purposes pursued, the CNIL nevertheless considers that the implementation of these processing operations cannot in principle be carried out at the same time. unknown to the public given the unprecedented nature of the deployment of these devices. The transparency and fairness of these treatments, ensured by clear and accessible information to the public, constitute for the CNIL an essential guarantee of this experiment. The CNIL therefore recommends that the hypotheses in which the exclusion of people's information would prove necessary must be particularly limited and expressly specified in the draft decree. As such, the CNIL takes note of the Government's clarification according to which the law has provided for this exclusion in order to coordinate with the legislative provisions relating to cameras installed on aircraft and that consequently the information of persons will not be excluded. only in cases where aircraft are themselves deployed in conditions which exclude the information of people. In any case, it will be up to the data controller to ensure, where applicable, the conditions under which the right to information could be excluded with regard to the applicable regime. It will be up to him in particular to verify whether partial information, relating to the principle of using “augmented” cameras, can be considered without compromising the security of the event. On the data protection impact assessment (DPIA) In accordance with V of article 10 of the law, the decree is accompanied by an AIPD which sets out in particular: the expected benefit of the use of algorithmic processing with regard to predetermined events giving rise to reporting by the system; the possible risks created by the use of “augmented” camera devices; the measures envisaged in order to minimize them and make them acceptable during their operation. The CNIL recalls that the creation of such a so-called “framework” AIPD is intended to constitute the reference base of the minimum guarantees to be implemented by all the data controllers referred to in I of Article 10 of the law, with regard to the risks identified in the context of the use of algorithmic devices. It notes, however, that the risk analysis carried out by the Government within this ""framework"" AIPD is necessarily limited at this stage, in the absence of knowledge of the precise characteristics of the algorithmic solutions which will be acquired from third parties or developed in-house. . This is why the CNIL notes that the “framework” AIPD which was submitted to it will be completed in two stages: first of all by the Government following the call for tenders from solution providers (in particular on the parts relating to subcontracting and the security of operation of the solution), before transmit it again to the CNIL and the data controllers; then, and in accordance with article 13 of the draft decree, by the data controllers who must complete this AIPD ""framework"" with the particular characteristics of each of the algorithmic processing operations implemented. The CNIL also notes that the AIPD ""framework"" for algorithmic processing must be carefully articulated with those of other processing subject to AIPD: on the one hand an AIPD ""design"" which will be carried out by the Ministry of the Interior on the design algorithmic processing; on the other hand and above all, the AIPD applicable to video protection systems whose images will be used by algorithmic processing. In particular, the CNIL notes that the risks linked to the compromise of images are mainly dealt with in the video protection AIPD and not in that on algorithmic processing. In this context, the CNIL draws the attention of data controllers to the fact that it will not only be a question of informing some particularities of implementation within the ""framework"" AIPD, but of assessing the risks created by each algorithmic solution and the measures considered to minimize them. It will be the responsibility of data controllers in particular to complete the AIPD concerning the implementation of algorithmic processing in connection with the AIPD on the implementation of processing originating from video protection systems, concerning: technical and organizational measures for consulting images relating to detected events, their recording and possible unloading of video content; specific organizational measures for the intervention of subcontractors who will install and configure the solutions and ensure that they are maintained in operational conditions. In this regard, the CNIL notes the Government's commitment to provide an employment doctrine to the services responsible for processing, referred to in I of Article 10 of the law, concerning in particular: the content of the reports made and the action taken; the content of people’s information; the methods of human control of reports. The CNIL invites the government to adapt the employment doctrine according to the recipient services, to remind everyone of the specificities of the legal framework that applies to them and the particularities of use of the system in the context of their missions.

On subcontractors The Health Data Platform (PDS) will be involved in the implementation of this study. The distribution of roles and responsibilities between the data controller and the PDS, particularly concerning the awareness of project users, the monitoring of traces, the management of alerts and incidents as well as the management of exports of anonymous data, must be formalized by an agreement between the two parties in accordance with Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). On the purpose of the processing and its nature of public interest The intended treatment is intended to be the implementation of a study on the epidemiology of epilepsy in France, entitled ""Epi²"" intended to: quantify the demand and supply of care for epileptic patients on a national scale; identify and describe ""typical"" care pathways for epileptic patients; estimate the cost of the disease by the different amounts reimbursed (hospitalizations, treatments, sick leave) work). The Commission notes that the ICM had proposed the ""Epi²"" project as part of the call for expressions of interest launched by the PDS in 2021, relating to the development of targeting algorithms in the SNDS, and that it was accompanied by the latter. Subject to the exercise of the right of opposition, two cohorts will be formed as part of this study: a first cohort, formed from data from the National Health Data System (SNDS), comprising patients who had a prescription for at least one antiepileptic medication in community care or who had been hospitalized with a diagnosis linked to epilepsy or having a long-term condition relating to ongoing severe epilepsy, made up of approximately 1.5 million people; a second cohort, comprising patients whose data appears in the Public Assistance health data warehouse – Paris Hospitals (AP-HP), having received antiepileptic treatment or having a significant main or associated diagnosis linked to epilepsy or having a significant main or associated diagnosis code, made up of approximately 340,000 people. The purpose of the processing is determined, explicit and legitimate, in accordance with article 5.1.b of the GDPR, and this processing has a purpose of public interest, in accordance with article 66.I of law no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 amended (“information technology and freedoms” law). On the lawfulness of the processing and the conditions allowing the processing of data concerning health The processing implemented by the ICM is necessary for the execution of the public interest mission with which it is entrusted. This processing is, as such, lawful with regard to article 6.1.e of the GDPR. In addition, this processing, necessary for scientific research purposes, also meets the condition provided for in Article 9.2.j of the GDPR allowing the processing of data concerning health. This research project is subject to the provisions of articles 44.3°, 66.III and 72 et seq. of the “data processing and freedoms” law, which results in the absence of conformity with a reference methodology, processing to purposes of research, study or evaluation in the field of health may only be implemented following authorization from the Commission. On points of non-compliance with the reference methodology concerned The application file mentions that the envisaged processing complies with the provisions of reference methodology MR-004, with the exception of the nature of the data processed and the methods of informing the persons concerned. Apart from these exceptions, this processing must respect the framework provided by the reference methodology MR-004. On the reuse of existing database data Certain data from the AP-HP health data warehouse (EDS) authorized by the CNIL (authorization request no. 198012 – deliberation no. 2017-013 of January 19, 2017) will be reused as part of this study and matched probabilistically to data from the National Health Data System (SNDS). On the special categories of data processed Regarding the processing of SNDS data: Provided that they can be disseminated by the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), the data controller requests access to the data from the national inter-regime health insurance information system (SNIIRAM), the health insurance program medicalization of information systems (PMSI) and medical causes of death (CépiDc) from 2015 to 2019. Only data that is strictly necessary and relevant to the purposes of the processing will be transmitted by the CNAM; in this regard, filtering and data matching will be carried out prior to this transmission by the CNAM. Since the data from SNIIRAM, PMSI and CépiDc come from databases making up the SNDS, all the legislative provisions (articles L. 1461-1 to L. 1461-7 of the public health code – CSP) and regulations relating to SNDS are applicable in this case, in particular: the prohibition of using this data for the purposes described in article L. 1461-1 V of the public health code; compliance with the security standards applicable to the SNDS provided for by the decree of March 22, 2017. The Commission considers that the data whose processing is envisaged are adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary with regard to the purposes of the processing, in accordance with the provisions of article 5.1.c of the GDPR. On information and people’s rights Under article 69 of the “data processing and freedoms” law and article 14.5.b of the GDPR, the obligation to provide individual information to the person concerned may be subject to exceptions, in the event that where the provision of such information would prove impossible, would require disproportionate effort or would seriously compromise the achievement of the objectives of the processing. In such cases, the data controller shall take appropriate measures to protect the rights and freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject, including by making the information publicly available. In this case, an exception will be made to the principle of individual information of people and appropriate measures will be implemented by the dissemination of collective information on the ICM website, on the transparency portal of the EDS of the AP-HP, as well as on the website of the Association Epilepsie France. This processing will also be recorded within the PDS transparency portal. These information methods are satisfactory with regard to the provisions of the GDPR and the “information technology and freedoms” law. Regarding the terms of exercise of rights: Data subjects will be able to exercise their rights with the data protection officer of the data controller for the duration of the study. These methods of exercising rights are satisfactory with regard to the provisions of the GDPR and the “data processing and freedoms” law. On buyers and recipients Only the data controller and the people authorized by him have access to the data within the framework of this authorization. The data controller maintains documents indicating the competent person(s) within it to issue authorization to access the data, the list of authorized persons, their respective access profiles and the terms of allocation, management and authorization control. These categories of people are subject to professional secrecy under the conditions defined by articles 226-13 and 226-14 of the penal code. The qualification of authorized persons and their access rights must be regularly reassessed, in accordance with the terms described in the authorization procedure established by the data controller. On data security and their hosting arrangements As a preliminary point, the Commission notes that the application file justifies the need to use the technical solution of the PDS, taking into account the characteristics as well as the specific methods of implementing this study, in particular the use of a set of software and technical solutions made available by the latter. Concerning data hosting within the PDS technical solution: The data security of the project space dedicated to the ""Epi²"" project essentially depends on the technical solution of the PDS, which has been the subject of a global analysis of risks and impact on privacy, followed by approval according to the SNDS safety standards. More specifically, an impact analysis relating to data protection was sent to the CNIL concerning the technical solution of the PDS, which corresponds to a secure SNDS bubble and which will host the ""Epi²"" project. The data controller has carried out and transmitted in support of the authorization request an impact analysis relating to data protection specific to the ""Epi²"" project and integrating the elements provided by the PDS for its technical solution. An approval of the project space was thus carried out by the data controller on June 8, 2023, for a period of three years, subject to the implementation of the action plan that he defined. This approval decision is only valid until June 8, 2026 and must therefore be renewed before this date if the project is still in progress. Concerning the extraction of data from the AP-HP warehouse: The CNIL recommends that the data transmitted to the CNAM for the purpose of carrying out the matching, which include identifying data (date of birth, sex, department of residence), be extracted in a temporary zone distinct from that where will be extracted the health data necessary for the study. Each temporary zone must have a level of security equivalent to that of the EDS. The extractions must also be carried out by two separate warehouse administrators, who will respectively be in charge of transmitting the data to the CNAM and the PDS in accordance with the planned procedures. These extractions must be the subject of a written procedure, activated only at the request of those responsible for the study, providing for adequate security measures and the deletion of the extracted data at the latest after validation that the matching has been carried out correctly. Each destruction must be the subject of a destruction report, communicated to those responsible for the study. Finally, the password policy, among other things concerning access to ICM workstations, must comply with deliberation no. 2022-100 of July 21, 2022 of the CNIL on the subject. The security measures implemented by the data controller appear proportionate to the risks presented by the processing. On data transfers outside the European Union The provisions of article R. 1461-1 of the CSP provide that no transfer of personal data may be carried out outside the European Union, except in the case of one-off access to data by persons located in outside the European Union, for a purpose falling under 1° of I of Article L. 1461-3 of the CSP. In this case, the application file mentions that, although the service provider is not exclusively subject to the laws and jurisdictions of the European Union, no transfer outside the European Union of individual data from the SNDS is planned, with no members of the research team located outside the European Union. On the duration of data retention The data will be made available for five years. This data retention period does not exceed the period necessary for the purposes for which they are collected and processed, in accordance with the provisions of article 5.1.e of the GDPR. Additional comments The targeting algorithms developed or validated as part of this project may be shared with the scientific community for possible reuse. In the event that they are published as open source, a risk study must be carried out beforehand in order to verify that it is not possible to extract personal data from them or to infer the presence of a person in the training dataset. Authorizes, in accordance with this deliberation, THE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD INSTITUTE to implement the aforementioned treatment. The president Marie-Laure DENIS"

The president Marie-Laure DENIS Reference methodology relating to the processing of data from the main database of the National Health Data System implemented for the purposes of research, study or evaluation in the field of health by organizations acting within the framework of their public interest mission (MR-007) Regulation (EU) No. 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (the GDPR) provides, in particular in Article 5, point 2, that the data controller must be able to demonstrate that the principles of the regulation are respected. Article 9(4) of the GDPR specifies that Member States may maintain or introduce additional conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data or data concerning health. Thus, in application of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended (“Informatics and Freedoms” Law), the processing of personal data for the purposes of research, study or evaluation in the field of health may be implemented provided that the data controller has made a declaration of conformity with a reference methodology. In the absence of compliance with a reference methodology, the processing must be the subject of an authorization request from the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties (the CNIL). The CNIL may approve and publish reference methodologies, under the standards mentioned in II of Article 66 of the “Informatique et Libertés” law, established in consultation with the Health Data Platform (PDS), as well as with public and private organizations representing the stakeholders concerned. Given their public interest missions, a large number of organizations carry out research, studies and evaluations in the field of health, which are part of a set of specific purposes corresponding to their missions (for example: evaluation of health pathway or quality of care, medico-economic assessments, responses to requests from public authorities, actions aimed at the general public, advice to members, etc.). In addition to that relating to data processing requiring access by health establishments and federations to data from the medicalization of information systems program (PMSI), made available on the secure platform of the Technical Agency of the information on hospitalization (ATIH), the Commission adopts a reference methodology relating to certain data processing of the National Health Data System (SNDS) implemented by data controllers acting within the framework of their mission of public interest.

The latter must focus in particular on raising awareness among users of the study, monitoring traces, managing alerts and incidents as well as managing exports of anonymous data. This agreement must comply with article 28 of the GDPR. Management of authorizations and logical access to data SEC-HAB-1 Different authorization profiles must be planned in order to manage access to data as necessary and exclusively. SEC-HAB-2 Persons authorized to access personal data must be individually authorized according to a procedure involving validation by their line manager. SEC-HAB-3 A review of authorizations must be carried out regularly and at least annually, as well as at the end of each study. SEC-HAB-4 Access permissions must be withdrawn as soon as authorizations are withdrawn, for example after the departure of an authorized user or a modification of their missions. User identification and authentication SEC-IDE-1 Access to personal data must be subject to local or national identification for any natural or legal person, in accordance with the requirements of level 2 of the PGSSI-S Identification Framework. SEC-IDE-2 Access to personal data must be subject to strong authentication involving at least two distinct authentication factors, in accordance with the requirements of level 2 of the PGSSI-S Authentication Standard. If one of these factors is a password, it must comply with the CNIL recommendations on passwords on the date of writing of this reference methodology (deliberation no. 2022-100 of July 21, 2022) . Project space SEC-ESP-1 The data from a study must be handled by authorized users only in a project space specific to this study, sealed with the data from the central SNDS as well as with the project spaces of other studies carried out in the same controlled environment. SEC-ESP-2 Data sets imported into a project space specific to a study must be minimized and limited to only the data necessary for the study. A unique pseudonym number specific to each project space must be generated under the same pseudonymization conditions as those defined by the security framework applicable to the aforementioned SNDS. For example, this unique pseudonymous number could be generated by a cryptographic hash function resistant to brute force attacks or a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator. Data transmission SEC-TRA-1 All data transmissions from or to the controlled environment or project spaces must be subject to encryption measures in accordance with appendix B1 of the general security framework (RGS) in order to guarantee confidentiality. These encryption measures apply to data in transit and to its storage after receipt in the controlled environment or project spaces. Exporting anonymous data outside of workspaces SEC-EXP-1 Only anonymous datasets can be exported outside the controlled environment or a project space. The anonymization process must produce a dataset that complies with the three criteria defined by G29 Opinion No. 05/2014 or any subsequent EDPS opinion relating to anonymization. This compliance must be documented. Otherwise, if these three criteria cannot be met, a study of the risks of re-identification must be carried out and documented, prior to each export. SEC-EXP-2 Data exports must be subject to prior validation by a manager in order to endorse the principle, particularly with regard to the SEC-EXP-1 requirement. SEC-EXP-3 Exports must be subject to automatic or manual monitoring by a specialized operator in order to verify their anonymous nature. In the event that this monitoring is automatic, any export identified as non-compliant must be the subject of an alert and quarantine in a partitioned and dedicated space, then must be verified manually by a specific manager. trained and empowered. User awareness and workstation security SEC-SEN-1 Each person authorized to access the controlled environment must be trained in respecting professional secrecy and regularly made aware of the risks and obligations inherent in the processing of health data. SEC-SEN-2 Each person authorized to access the controlled environment must sign a confidentiality charter. This must specify in particular the obligations with regard to both the protection of personal health data and the security measures put in place in the controlled environment, as well as the sanctions relating to non-compliance with these obligations. SEC-SEN-3 The workstations of people authorized to access the controlled environment, including external users accessing only project spaces, must be subject to specific security measures, for example by setting up nominative accounts, adequate authentication , automatic session locking, hard drive encryption and filtering measures. In the event that the workstations are not under the control of the data controller, the security measures to be put in place on the workstations must be regulated by means of an agreement between the parties concerned. Logging SEC-JOU-1 The actions of project space users and those of users of the controlled environment must be subject to logging measures, in accordance with the requirements of level 3 of the PGSSI-S Accountability Framework. In particular, connections (identifiers, date and time), requests and operations carried out must be traced. SEC-JOU-2 A trace control must be carried out regularly and at least monthly, as well as at the end of each authorization period linked to a study. This control must be carried out by: a solution carrying out automatic monitoring with the reporting of alerts processed manually by an authorized operator; orsemi-automatic control via execution of programs allowing selection of abnormal traces, followed by manual rereading by an authorized operator. SEC-JOU-3 The logging traces defined in the SEC-JOU-1 requirements must be kept for a period of six months to one year from their collection, unless otherwise justified by the importance of the risk for individuals in the event of diversion from the purposes of the processing. and the frequency of occurrence of such practices. In the latter case, the maximum retention period for logging traces can be extended to three years. Managing security incidents and personal data breaches SEC-INC-1 The parties to the agreement must provide a procedure for managing and handling security incidents and personal data breaches, specifying the roles and responsibilities and the actions to be taken in the event of such incidents occurring. SEC-INC-2 Any security incident, whether of malicious origin or not and occurring intentionally or unintentionally, having the consequence, even temporary, of compromising the integrity, confidentiality or availability of personal data, must be the subject of 'internal documentation in a register of violations. SEC-INC-3 Any data breach must be notified to the CNIL under the conditions provided for in Article 33 of the GDPR. SEC-INC-4 In the event that the violation is likely to result in a high risk for the rights and freedoms of a natural person, the data controller is required to communicate the data violation to the data subjects as soon as possible, in accordance with the article 34 of the GDPR. 3.5. These measures are not exhaustive and must be supplemented with regard to the risks weighing on the processing implemented. 3.6. In addition, Articles 5.1.f and 32 of the GDPR require security measures to be updated with regard to regular reassessment of risks and that the measures comply with the state of the art. Title IV: SUBCONTRACTORS 4.1. When the data controller uses one or more subcontractors, he ensures that they provide sufficient guarantees regarding the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures, so that the processing meets the requirements. of the GDPR and the “data processing and freedoms” law and guarantees the protection of the rights of the person concerned. 4.2. A data controller may in particular choose as a subcontractor a health establishment, a hospital federation or a research laboratory or design office. 4.3. The data controller establishes a contract or other legal document with the subcontractor specifying the obligations of each party and setting out the requirements of Article 28 of the GDPR. 4.4. Furthermore, subcontractors: must appoint, where applicable, a data protection officer in accordance with Article 37 of the GDPR; must keep a register of the categories of processing carried out on behalf of the data controller, in accordance with Article 30 of the GDPR. TITLE V: HOSTING OF SNDS DATA AND ABSENCE OF DATA TRANSFER OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION 5.1. As part of this reference methodology, the study data controller(s) ensures: that the data from the main database of the SNDS hosted in the controlled environment are exclusively within the member countries of the European Economic Area and without possible transfer outside the European Union; the absence of remote access to data from outside the territory of the European Union. 5.2. Furthermore, organizations and, where applicable, their subcontractors, accessing SNDS data as part of carrying out operations for hosting the technical infrastructure of the controlled environment, as well as the administration and exploitation associated with this storage, must be exclusively subject to the laws of the European Union. Title VI: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF RESPONSIBILITY 6.1. Data protection impact analysis 6.1.1. The data controller carries out a data protection impact analysis carried out in accordance with the provisions of Article 35 of the GDPR, which must cover in particular the risks to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. 6.1.2. This impact analysis must be re-examined and updated regularly, in particular if significant changes are planned in the processing implemented within the framework of this methodology or if the risks for the persons concerned have evolved. 6.1.3. A single analysis can cover a set of similar processing operations that present similar risks. 6.2. Formalities 6.2.1. Each data controller appoints a data protection officer, in accordance with article 37 of the GDPR. This data protection delegate will have the particular mission of verifying compliance with the conformity of the processing implemented according to this methodology. 6.2.2. The data controller sends the CNIL a single declaration of conformity to this methodology for all the processing operations it implements as long as they are and will be carried out in compliance with all the provisions of the methodology. 6.2.3. As part of joint responsibility, each data controller makes a declaration of conformity to the reference methodology on its own behalf. 6.2.4.The treatments covered by this reference methodology must obtain an expressly favorable opinion from CESREES prior to their implementation. To obtain this opinion, a file must be submitted to the PDS single secretariat and must include the elements listed in this methodology. 6.2.5. In accordance with Article 30 of the GDPR, the data controller maintains, within the register of processing activities, the list of processing operations implemented within the framework of this methodology. It regularly checks the compliance of ongoing processing with the requirements of the reference methodology and documents this analysis. 6.3. Principle of transparency 6.3.1. The legal framework allowing the provision of SNDS data is designed to report their use to the population. To this end, article L. 1461-3 II of the CSP makes access to SNDS data and its components subject to communication to the PDS of several elements by the data controller, before and after carrying out the studies. 6.3.2. Thus, the data controller undertakes to record in the public directory maintained by the PDS each study carried out within the framework of this methodology. 6.3.3. This recording must be made, before the start of each study, by the data controller or the person acting on his or her behalf. It is accompanied by the transmission to the PDS of a file including: the protocol, including the justification of the public interest, as well as a summary, according to the model made available by the PDS. In the event of a favorable opinion with recommendations from CESREES, the protocol and the summary clearly taking into account the recommendations, must be registered; the declaration of interests, in relation to the object of the study, of the data controller and where applicable from the subcontractor. 6.3.4. At the end of the study, the method and the results obtained must be communicated to the PDS for publication. 6.3.5. The recording of the treatment and the transmission of the results are carried out in accordance with the procedures defined by the PDS. 6.4. Balance sheet 6.4.1. The data controller, where applicable after consulting the subcontractor(s), transmits to the CNIL every three years a report summarizing the observed uses of this reference methodology, indicating in particular: the number of studies implemented over the period analyzed; the types of purposes pursued; the financing arrangements for projects and partners (in particular public funding, etc.); concerning the data processed: the components of the SNDS mainly requested; compliance overall expression of needs for the objectives of the study; the average historical depth requested and its sufficiency or not; the average number of people concerned by the studies; the average duration of access or retention of data requested and their sufficiency or not; the collective information supports implemented; the quality of the people authorized to access SNDS data; concerning data security: security incidents, likely to impact the rights of individuals, possibly revealed or avoided; any substantial modification to the architecture of the controlled environment; the number of scientific publications resulting from research, studies and evaluations carried out within the framework of the methodology; the benefits, scientific contributions observed and/or measured. Title VII: ENTRY INTO FORCE 7.1. This reference methodology comes into force from its publication in the Official Journal. 7.2. When research, study or evaluation in the field of health, previously authorized by the CNIL, is subject to a substantial modification and complies with this methodology, it is not necessary to obtain a new authorization of the CNIL. 7.3. This deliberation will be published in the Official Journal of the French Republic."

Facts and procedure 1. The company DE PARTICULIER A PARTICULIER – EDITIONS NERESSIS (hereinafter “the company”), whose head office is located at 45 rue du Cardinal Lemoine in Paris (75005), was registered in the trade and companies register on 14 November 1975. Its turnover amounted in 2021 to \[…\] euros for a net result of \[…\] euros and in 2022 to \[…\] euros for a net result of \[…\] euros. 2. The company DE PARTICULIER A PARTICULIER – EDITIONS NERESSIS provides individuals with a set of publications and services allowing them to conclude real estate transactions without an intermediary. The company publishes the website www.pap.fr which allows individuals to publish or consult real estate advertisements and to have access to various tools allowing the management of real estate projects (legal assistance, real estate coaching, credit and price calculations). per square meter, the evaluation of the price of goods for sale and notary fees). 3. Two control missions took place pursuant to decision no. 2022-041C of March 2, 2022 of the president of the CNIL in order to verify compliance by the company with all the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/ 679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter “the GDPR” or “the Regulation”) and Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 relating to data processing, files and freedoms as amended (hereinafter “the Data Protection Act”). On March 8, 2022, the CNIL services carried out an online check using the website “www.pap.fr”. On April 7, 2022, the CNIL services carried out an on-site inspection at the company's premises located in Paris (75005). 4. The online monitoring of the website www.pap.fr was mainly intended to verify the methods of informing people and the procedure for creating a user account. The on-site inspection focused more specifically on the verification of the retention periods applied to user account data, the supervision by a legal act of the processing carried out by a subcontractor, the technical and organizational measures intended to ensure the security of the data. collected through the website as well as information from people prospecting for similar products and services. 5. By emails of April 10 and June 7, 2022, the company sent additional information to the Commission services. 6. In accordance with Article 56 of the GDPR, on January 17, 2023, the CNIL informed all European supervisory authorities of its competence to act as lead supervisory authority regarding cross-border processing implemented by the company, resulting from the fact that the sole establishment of the company is in France. After discussions between the CNIL and the European data protection authorities within the framework of the one-stop shop mechanism, it appears that the German, Austrian, Belgian, Danish, Spanish, Finnish, Greek, Irish, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian and Polish authorities , Portuguese and Swedish are concerned by the processing, user accounts having been created by persons residing in these States. 7. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission, on February 6, 2023, appointed Ms. Sophie LAMBREMON as rapporteur on the basis of article 22 of the Data Protection Act. 8. On July 20, 2023, the rapporteur notified the company of a report detailing the breaches of articles 5-1-e), 12, 13, 28 and 32 of the GDPR as well as article L.34-5 of the Postal and Electronic Communications Code, which it considered constituted in this case. 9. On September 8, 2023, the company produced observations in response to the sanction report. 10. On October 6, 2023, the rapporteur responded to the company's observations. 11. On November 3, 2023, the company submitted further observations in response to the rapporteur's observations. 12. By letter dated November 9, 2023, the rapporteur informed the company that the investigation was closed, in application of article 40, III, of amended decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019. 13. By letter of the same day, the company was informed that the file was included on the agenda for the restricted training of November 30, 2023. 14. By email of November 14, 2023, the company's counsel requested a postponement of the restricted training session. 15. By letter dated November 16, 2023, the company's board was informed of the postponement of the meeting to December 21, 2023. 16. The rapporteur and the company presented oral observations during the restricted training session. II. Reasons for decision A. On the European cooperation procedure 17. In application of Article 60 paragraph 3 of the GDPR, the draft decision adopted by the restricted committee was transmitted on December 29, 2023 to the European supervisory authorities concerned. 18. As of 26 January 2024, none of the supervisory authorities concerned had raised a relevant and reasoned objection to this draft decision, so that, pursuant to Article 60(6) of the GDPR , the latter are deemed to have approved it. B. On the failure to comply with the obligation to limit the duration of data retention 19. Under the terms of article 5-1, e) of the GDPR, personal data must be ""kept in a form allowing the identification of the persons concerned for a period not exceeding that necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. 20. The rapporteur noted that, during the on-site inspection, the company indicated that it had defined a different data retention policy depending on the type of user of the website www.pap.fr. Thus, concerning customer data (people using the site's paid services), the rapporteur noted that the company had defined a retention period of ten years from the date of acceptance of the order. It noted that the systematic and indiscriminate retention of all account data for ten years did not appear justified with regard to the legal obligation arising from the Consumer Code and that in the extraction of the database provided there appeared data relating to transactions of less than 120 euros whose retention did not appear justified. Concerning user data (people using the free services of the site), the rapporteur noted that if the company had defined a retention period of five years from the date of the last connection to the account, it emerged from the control on place that the company had retained 2,394,538 lines for more than five years and less than ten years and 737,563 lines for more than ten years. 21. In defense, concerning the data of customers using paid advertisements, the company, during the investigation, specified keeping the advertisement and the electronic address for ten years for the purposes of compliance with the legal obligations arising from the articles L.213-1, D.213-1 and D.213-2 of the consumer code, the fight against fraud and due to the specificities linked to the real estate activity. She detailed the two paying plans offered to customers: either a no-obligation contract for 59 euros per month which amounts to a single contract of indefinite duration, or a three-month contract taken out for 135 euros. For non-binding contracts, considering that it cannot determine the duration of the contract in advance, the company has specified that it will keep all data relating to these contracts for a period of ten years regardless of the final amount. It further considers that it is necessary to take into account the financial issues of advertisements and contracts for the sale of goods subsequently concluded for an amount well above 120 euros. She also indicated that the retention period for years of birth was reduced to twenty-five months and that of data relating to an inactive account to three years of inactivity. 22. Concerning the data relating to users, the company, during the investigation, specified that it would only keep the electronic address and the associated account for a period of five years for litigation and anti-fraud purposes and that it had deleted the data retained beyond this period of five years. 23. The restricted training recalls that it is the responsibility of the data controller to define and implement a data retention period not exceeding that necessary in view of the purpose for which they are processed. 24. With regard to the relevant durations, for illustrative purposes, the restricted training notes that in its framework relating to the processing of personal data implemented for the purposes of managing commercial activities, the CNIL specifies that the data necessary for the execution of a contract are retained during the contractual relationship and that compliance with a legal obligation incumbent on the organization may, in particular, justify a longer retention period. Failing this, the storage must be based on another legal basis provided for in Article 6 of the GDPR. 25. Under the terms of article L. 213-1 of the Consumer Code: ""When the contract is concluded electronically and it concerns a sum equal to or greater than an amount fixed by decree, the professional contractor ensures the conservation of the writing which establishes it for a period determined by this same decree and guarantees access to it at any time to its co-contractor if the latter requests it. "". 26. Article D. 213-1 of the same code provides that ""\[t\]he amount mentioned in article L. 213-1 is set at 120 euros"" and article D. 213-2 provides that ""\[ The period mentioned in Article L. 213-1 is set at ten years from the conclusion of the contract when delivery of the goods or execution of the service is immediate. Otherwise, the period runs from from the conclusion of the contract until the date of delivery of the goods or performance of the service and for a period of ten years from this date. 27. In this case, the restricted training firstly notes, with regard to the retention of customer data, that the retention period of ten years from the date of acceptance of the order defined by the company is justified by its legal obligations resulting from the aforementioned consumer code for contracts of an amount greater than 120 euros. Thus, the restricted training considers that, for the three-month contracts offered by the company for an amount of 135 euros, the retention of data for a period of ten years is fully justified. 28. On the other hand, the restricted training notes that, for non-binding contracts of an amount of 59 euros per month, the company retains by default the data relating to these contracts as soon as they are concluded and even the total amount paid by the user would be less than 120 euros. However, in the event that a customer has only used the company's paid services for one or two months, that is to say for an amount less than 120 euros, the data retention period provided for by the code of consumption would not apply. The restricted panel notes that article D.213-1 of the Consumer Code expressly specifies “when the contract (…) concerns an equal or greater sum”. The only amount to be taken into consideration is therefore that of the contract concluded between the PAP company and the customer, especially since the PAP company is a third party to the contract for the sale of goods concluded between the selling customer and the buyer. Consequently, the restricted training considers that the retention of data of customers finding themselves in the situation which has just been described is not made obligatory by compliance with the consumer code, contrary to what the company indicates. 29. In any event, the restricted panel notes that it appears from an extraction of 100 lines corresponding to accounts of customers who placed orders more than five years ago that 69 of them concerned orders for an amount less than 120 euros. Therefore, the restricted panel considers that the company has kept account data not affected by Article D. 213-1 of the Consumer Code for excessive periods of time. 30. Next, the restricted training notes, with regard to the retention of user data, that the company has defined a period of five years which begins to run on the date of the last connection to the user account. The restricted panel considers that the explanations provided by the company during the investigation justify the retention period for litigation and anti-fraud purposes. 31. Nevertheless, the restricted panel observes that it appears from the on-site inspection that the company had kept 2,394,538 lines corresponding to user accounts more than five years from the date of the last connection and less than ten years and 737,563 lines corresponding to user accounts more than ten years old from the date of the last connection. 32. The restricted panel notes that it follows from the above that when the retention period is reached, the personal data must be deleted. Therefore, it appears from the documents in the file that on the date of the on-site inspection, the company retained user account data beyond what was necessary in view of the announced purpose. 33. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that the above facts characterize a breach of article 5-1-e) of the GDPR. The restricted training notes that the company partially complied during the procedure with the application of an adequate retention period for user account data with regard to the different purposes pursued by deleting data relating to these accounts have been inactive for more than five years. This compliance cannot exempt the company from its responsibility for the past. C. On the failure to comply with the obligation to inform individuals 34. Article 13 of the GDPR lists the information that must be provided to the data subject when personal data is collected directly from them. This information relates in particular to the identity of the data controller and his contact details, the purposes of the processing implemented, its legal basis, the recipients or categories of recipients of the data, the fact that the data controller intends to 'carry out a data transfer to a third country. The article also requires the data controller, when this appears necessary to guarantee ""fair and transparent processing"" of personal data in this case, to inform individuals about the duration of data retention, the existence of the various rights from which individuals benefit, the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. 35. In her report, the rapporteur notes in essence that the information provided by the company on the website www.pap.fr, through its ""personal data protection policy"" page, was incomplete or imprecise, due to failure to specify the processing to which the legal bases relate, the recipients or categories of recipients of data, the right to lodge a complaint with the CNIL and the retention periods defined by the company. The rapporteur notes, however, that the company has, since the inspections, engaged in a process of compliance, without this calling into question the shortcomings in the past. 36. In defense, the company contests the breach. She only believes that she delivered the information imprecisely. It indicates that it has complied since the controls by modifying and supplementing its personal data protection policy. Regarding the legal bases applicable to the processing, the company cites an awkward presentation. With regard to the mention of recipients or categories of recipients, it considers that it was not required to provide the identity of all the recipients of data. 37. The restricted panel notes that it appears from the findings made during the controls that with regard to the website www.pap.fr, a personal data protection policy was accessible from the footer of the home page, a document to which the user account creation form also returned. However, it appears that although the legal bases were indicated, no explanation was provided regarding the processing to which they related. 38. In addition, the restricted panel notes, like the rapporteur, that the company indicated the name of only one of its subcontractors, the company \[…\], which is in charge of payments made on the site . Apart from this scenario, no information was provided concerning the other recipients or categories of recipients of personal data. However, the restricted training notes that it appears from the controls that the company had at least two other subcontractors recipients of the personal data. 39. Also, the restricted panel considers that the company has not complied with the provisions of Article 13 (1) of the GDPR. 40. Next, the restricted training notes, on the one hand, that this personal data protection policy did not mention the right to lodge a complaint with the CNIL and, on the other hand, that the storage periods indicated were inaccurate. 41. However, the restricted panel considers that this information, in that it helps to ensure that users have control over the processing of their data, is important to guarantee fair and transparent processing. 42. The restricted panel considers that the absence of mention of the right to lodge a complaint with the CNIL and the imprecision of the information relating to the retention period of user data in the company's confidentiality policy, constitute a breach of Article 13 (2) of the GDPR. 43. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that the company has committed a breach of Article 13 of the GDPR. It specifies that the breach taken into account is the one which was crystallized at the time of the controls and notes that the company has brought itself into compliance. D. On the failure linked to the obligation to regulate by a legal act the processing carried out on behalf of the data controller 44. Under Article 28(3) of the Regulation, processing carried out by a processor on behalf of a controller is governed by a contract or any other formalized legal act which defines the purpose and the duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data, the categories of data subjects as well as the obligations and rights of the data controller. This contract also provides for the conditions under which the subcontractor undertakes to carry out processing operations on behalf of the controller. 45. The rapporteur noted that the contractual documents of the companies \[…\], subcontractors of the company, did not contain all the information provided for by the aforementioned article. 46. In defense, the company contests the breach with regard to the contractual relationship with the company \[…\]. In this regard, it specifies that the latter is governed by a contract which refers to a data processing agreement, which contains the information required by Article 28. Concerning the contract concluded with the company \[…\], the company indicates that it has concluded an amendment to the contract containing the information provided for in Article 28. Finally, the company declares that it has terminated the contractual relationship with the company \[…\]. 47. The restricted panel notes that with regard to the company's contractual documents \[…\], the company had provided the CNIL delegation with the only contract concluded on November 19, 2021. It subsequently paid in response to the sanction report the data processing agreement to which the contract refers. The restricted panel considers that these contractual documents, read as a whole, contain all the necessary information. The breach is therefore not constituted for this contractual relationship. 48. Then with regard to the contract concluded with the company \[…\], the restricted panel notes that the amendment produced by the company in response to the sanction report was concluded on September 7, 2023. The restricted panel notes that this amendment contains all the required information but considers that the breach has occurred in the past with regard to the date of signature of the said amendment. The restricted panel considers in fact that the retroactive nature of the amendment used by the company cannot cover the breach for the past to the extent that during the inspections the contract concluded did not contain the required information. 49. Finally, with regard to the contract concluded with the company \[…\], the restricted panel considers that having regard to the documents produced, it has not been established that this company processed personal data on behalf of the company PAP and had the status of subcontractor within the meaning of the GDPR. Also the breach of article 28 is not characterized. 50. Ultimately, the restricted panel considers that the breach of Article 28, paragraph 3, of the GDPR is constituted for the past facts concerning the contract governing the relationship with the company \[…\]. E. On breaches of the obligation to ensure data security 51. Under the terms of Article 32 of the GDPR, “1. Taking into account the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks , the degree of probability and severity of which varies, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, including including, among other things, as needed: a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data; (b) means to ensure the continued confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; c) means to restore the availability of and access to personal data within appropriate time frames in the event of a physical or technical incident; d) a procedure aimed at regularly testing, analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing"". 1. On passwords and confidential references 52. The rapporteur notes that, on the one hand, during the online check, the delegation noted that when creating a user account on the company's website, passwords of a unique character ( a number or a letter) were accepted and that no access restrictions in the event of authentication failure were implemented. In addition, the rapporteur notes that, during the checks, each password was both stored in clear text and hashed with the Bcrypt hashing algorithm. 53. Furthermore, the rapporteur notes that, during the on-site inspection, the delegation was informed that when submitting an advertisement without having an account, the user was given a confidential reference consisting of ten characters in plain text. alphanumeric, the first seven of which were public since they corresponded to the characters of the reference of the advertisement placed on the site. This confidential reference could not be modified by the advertiser. This single reference allowed the user to directly access the ad and the associated space on the site after having entered it in the corresponding field. Furthermore, this confidential reference, which is similar to a password, was stored in plain text in the database. 54. In defense, the company does not contest the breaches in substance but declares that it has taken corrective action. First of all, it announces that it has adapted its password policy by requiring passwords of eight characters in length composed of at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number and one special character. She recalls that passwords are now hashed with the Bcrypt algorithm and that passwords kept in plain text have been deleted. Then, the company specifies that it no longer communicates confidential references to users requiring the creation of an account on the site and that it has implemented the blocking of the owner space after ten unsuccessful connection attempts. 55. First of all, the restricted training recalls that it follows from the provisions of Article 32 of the GDPR that the data controller is required to ensure that the automated data processing that it implements is sufficiently secure. The sufficiency of the security measures is assessed, on the one hand, with regard to the characteristics of the processing and the risks it induces, and on the other hand, taking into account the state of knowledge and the cost of the measures. 56. The restricted training considers first of all that overly permissive password complexity rules, which authorize the use of insufficiently strong passwords, can lead to attacks by unauthorized third parties, such as attacks by “brute force” or “by dictionary”, which consist of successively and systematically testing numerous passwords and thus lead to a compromise of associated accounts and the personal data they contain. 57. It notes, in this regard, that the need for a strong password is recommended both by the National Information Systems Security Agency (ANSSI) and by the Commission in its deliberation no. 2017-012 of January 19, 2017 adopting a recommendation relating to passwords, requirement confirmed in its deliberation no. 2022-100 of July 21, 2022. 58. By way of illustration, the restricted panel recalls that the Commission considers in its deliberation no. 2017-012 of January 19, 2017 – which is certainly not of an imperative nature but which provides relevant insight into the measures it should be taken in terms of security – that, to ensure a sufficient level of security and confidentiality, in the event that authentication is based solely on an identifier and a password, the latter must be composed of at least twelve characters including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. 59. Failing this, the Commission considers that authentication based on a password of a minimum length of eight characters, made up of three different categories of characters but accompanied by a complementary measure such as, for example, delaying access to the account after several failures (temporary suspension of access whose duration increases with each attempt), the establishment of a mechanism to protect against submissions automated and intensive attempts (e.g. “captcha”) and/or blocking of the account after several unsuccessful authentication attempts (maximum ten). 60. The restricted panel emphasizes that it has adopted financial sanctions where the characterization of a breach of Article 32 of the GDPR is the result of insufficient measures to guarantee the security of the data processed. Deliberations No. SAN-2019-006 of June 13, 2019, No. SAN-2019-007 of July 18, 2019 and No. SAN-2022-018 of September 8, 2022 particularly target the insufficient robustness of passwords. 61. The restricted panel notes that in this case, on the one hand, the passwords of users of the website www.pap.fr had to be, at the time of the checks, composed of a unique character and devoid of additional security measures. It appears from the company's observations that the required passwords are now 8 characters long, composed of at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number and one special character without any access restriction being provided. On the other hand, confidential references - comparable to passwords within the meaning of the definition of deliberation no. 2022-100 of July 21, 2022 according to which the term password designates any knowledge factor, namely any set of revocable information, known only to the person concerned and allowing or contributing to the authentication of the latter - consisted of ten alphanumeric characters of which the first seven were public, in that they corresponded to the reference of the announcement on the site, with only the last three private characters. In addition, these references were transmitted in plain text and could not be modified by the user so that they constituted a lasting means of authentication. 62. The restricted panel considers that such constructions do not ensure the security of the data and prevent unauthorized third parties from having access to it. 63. Concerning the passwords required when creating an account, she recalls, as the rapporteur pointed out, that the company was processing data associated with nearly five million user accounts on the day of the on-site inspection. such as last name, first name, email address. Thus, these passwords, associated with their identifiers, allow access to all the personal data contained in their www.pap.fr accounts. They were not robust enough, given the personal data involved and the state of the art. 64. Concerning the confidential reference, the restricted panel considers that the use of this single reference consisting of ten alphanumeric characters did not meet the criterion of sufficient complexity. Indeed, it appears that a first part of this reference, the first seven alphanumeric characters corresponding to the reference of the ad, must be considered a public identifier. As for the second part of the reference, composed of the last three alphanumeric characters, which is similar to a password, does not meet the robustness criteria as described above. 65. In addition, as the rapporteur pointed out, this confidential reference allows access to the personal data present in the owner space associated with the person who published the advertisement, to modify them and also modify the advertisement . Furthermore, access to this space allows access to the exchanges between the owner and the people interested in the advertisement during which a lot of personal information can be transmitted (family, professional, financial situations). 66. Also, authentication based on the use, on the one hand, of a password, in the past short and lacking additional security measures, currently still insufficiently robust in the absence of additional security measures and , on the other hand, a non-modifiable confidential reference, transmitted in plain text and without sufficient complexity, can lead to attacks by unauthorized third parties and thus to a compromise of user accounts and of the ""owner space"" and of numerous personal data they contain. 67. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that the password and confidential reference policy deployed was and remains insufficiently robust to guarantee the security of the data processed, which disregards Article 32 of the GDPR. 68. Secondly, the restricted training recalls that storing passwords securely constitutes a basic precaution in terms of the protection of personal data. As early as 2013, ANSSI alerted and recalled good practices regarding the conservation of passwords by indicating that they must ""be stored in a form transformed by a one-way cryptographic function (hash function) and slow to calculate such as PBKDF2"" and that ""the transformation of passwords must involve a random salt to prevent an attack by precalculated tables"" (ANSSI, ""News Bulletin CERTA-2013-ACT-046"", November 15, 2013, https ://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/actualite/CERTA-2013-ACT-046/). 69. Likewise, in its deliberation no. 2017-012 of January 19, 2017, the CNIL already indicated that it ""recommends \[that the password\] be transformed by means of a non-reversible and secure cryptographic function (this that is to say using a public algorithm deemed strong whose software implementation is free of known vulnerabilities), integrating the use of a salt or a key"". Indeed, non-robust hash functions present known vulnerabilities which do not guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of passwords in the event of a brute force attack after compromise of the servers which host them. 70. In the present case, the restricted panel notes that the conservation in plain text, on the one hand, of user passwords, associated with their identifiers and their email address, and, on the other hand, of confidential references , associated with a personal space, does not guarantee their security. This method of conservation implies that any person with access to the company's customer database – whether an administrator of the company's information systems or an attacker in the event of compromise – can consult them, collect them, modify or sell them. 71. Under these conditions, the restricted panel considers that the storage methods for passwords and confidential references did not make it possible, at the time of the findings, to guarantee the security and confidentiality of the personal data of user account holders. which ignores article 32 of the GDPR. 72. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that the aforementioned facts, not contested by the company, constitute breaches of the obligations of Article 32 of the GDPR. It notes that since the controls, the company has partially remedied the shortcomings observed by implementing a password policy with an adequate level of security and by encrypting all passwords. 2. On the conservation of data in an active database 73. The rapporteur notes that during the inspections, the delegation was informed that all data relating to inactive customers was kept for ten years and that relating to inactive user accounts for five years on an active basis without Intermediate archiving intervention. 74. In defense, the company contests the existence of the breach. First, it argues that this conservation in an active database of the data of customers and users who have become inactive is justified by the purpose of combating fraud which requires daily checks. Then, it specifies that only people with an interest in processing data due to their functions can access personal data, namely customer service advisors, employees of IT departments and members of management. In this regard, she adds that these employees are subject to a confidentiality clause and a confidentiality commitment and that each of them has a personal password. 75. The restricted training recalls that to ensure data security, it is necessary for this data to be sorted when it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. Therefore, they must be deleted or be subject to intermediate archiving, consisting in particular of physical or logical separation. 76. In the present case, the restricted panel notes that it appears from the explanations provided by the company that if the purpose of combating fraud can justify the retention of data, the terms of conservation of data in active database as defined by the company does not ensure data security. On the one hand, the restricted training highlights the large number of categories of employees having access to the database to the extent that both customer service advisors, employees of the IT departments and members of management are authorized to access the database. On the other hand, it notes the absence of sorting carried out between the data retained while it appears that the conservation of data such as those of the advertisement and the billing address is not necessary for the objective pursued in the fight against fraud. The company indeed confirmed during the session that the data used to identify fraudsters was the email address. 77. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that the breach has been established. F. On the breach of the obligation to provide information and the right to object to commercial prospecting by email for similar products or services 78. Article L. 34-5 of the Postal and Electronic Communications Code (CPCE) provides that “Direct prospecting by means of an automated electronic communications system \[…\], a fax machine or electronic mail using the contact details of a natural person \[…\] who has not previously expressed their consent to receive direct marketing by this means. Direct marketing constitutes the sending of any message intended to promote, directly or indirectly, goods, services or the image of a person selling goods or providing services. For the purposes of this article, calls and messages intended to encourage the user or subscriber to call a premium rate number or send a premium rate text message also fall under direct prospecting. However, direct prospecting by email is authorized if the recipient's contact details have been collected from him, in compliance with the provisions of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 relating to data processing, files and freedoms. , on the occasion of a sale or provision of services, if the direct prospecting concerns similar products or services provided by the same natural or legal person, and if the recipient is offered, in an express and unambiguous manner ambiguity, the possibility of objecting, free of charge, apart from those linked to the transmission of the refusal, and in a simple manner, to the use of one's contact details at the time they are collected and each time a prospecting email is addressed to him in case he has not immediately refused such exploitation. 79. These provisions transpose into French law the rules governing the use of automated call and communication systems without human intervention (automatic callers), fax machines or electronic mail sending systems for direct prospecting purposes. laid down by Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 12, 2002 on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (known as the ""ePrivacy"" directive), such as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of November 25, 2009. 80. The rapporteur notes that when a user subscribes to an alert concerning real estate, he or she is likely to receive emails for similar goods or services from the company, without having been informed or having had the opportunity to object, when creating the alert. 81. In defense, the company contests the breach by asserting that the disputed emails do not constitute commercial prospecting since they do not aim to promote goods or services. In addition, it highlights the low volume of this type of messages and specifies that users have the possibility of unsubscribing via an unsubscribe link present in each new communication. 82. The restricted training recalls that within the meaning of article L.34-5 of the CPCE, on the one hand, direct commercial prospecting is defined as ""any message aimed at the direct or indirect promotion of goods, services or 'image of a person selling goods or providing services'. On the other hand, similar products and services, offered during a sale or provision of services, must be understood as promoting goods or services from the same natural or legal person without the necessity that the promotion leads to a financial transaction with the person. 83. The restricted training considers that emails sent by the company to users such as those containing information concerning an announcement or anonymous surveys on real estate news arise directly from the subscription to the alert relating to real estate and are not intended to promote other goods or services offered by the company. Also, these emails do not constitute commercial prospecting within the meaning of article L.34-5 of the CPCE. 84. Under these conditions, the restricted panel considers that the breach of article L.34-5 of the CPCE is not constituted. III. On corrective measures and their publicity 85. Under the terms of III of article 20 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended: ""When the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 or from this law, the president of the National Commission for Informatics and Liberties may also , if necessary after having sent him the warning provided for in I of this article or, where applicable in addition to a formal notice provided for in II, refer the matter to the restricted formation of the commission with a view to pronouncement, after adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of of a company, 2% of the total global annual turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher. In the hypotheses mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 from April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted panel takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83. 86. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that “Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the administrative fines imposed \[…\] are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive”, before specifying the elements to be taken into account for decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide the amount of this fine. A. On the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount 1. On the imposition of an administrative fine 87. In defense, the company considers that the proposed administrative fine is disproportionate in relation to the alleged breaches and its conduct since it implemented several corrective measures before the end of the investigation, in particular, the modification of its confidentiality policy in order to deliver the required information, the use of subcontractors framed by a legal act containing all the information provided for, the establishment of a policy and password storage presenting a level of security adequate. In addition, it emphasizes having fully cooperated with the services of the CNIL. She adds that she did not derive any financial benefit from the alleged breaches. It argues that its turnover is stagnating and that the real estate sector, particularly competitive, is in crisis. Finally, it considers that the fine of 250,000 euros proposed by the rapporteur is equivalent to \[…\]% of its 2023 turnover and is, therefore, excessive. 88. The restricted committee recalls that it must take into account, when issuing an administrative fine, the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, seriousness and duration of the violation, the scope or the purpose of the processing concerned, the number of data subjects affected, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects, the fact that the violation was committed through negligence, the degree of cooperation with the processing authority control and, in some cases, the level of harm suffered by people. 89. The restricted training first notes that the failings alleged against the company infringe fundamental principles provided for by the GDPR and concern many people. 90. With regard to the breach of the principle of limiting the retention period of personal data, the company was negligent, on the one hand, by not adequately defining a retention period relating to personal data. customers having concluded a contract of less than 120 euros and, on the other hand, by not applying the retention period that it had defined for data relating to users on the day of the checks. The restricted training notes that this breach concerns a significant number of people, the company counting 2,394,538 users whose last connection to their account was between five and ten years ago on the date of the checks. 91. Regarding the failure to comply with the obligation to inform the persons concerned and to provide transparency, the restricted panel notes that the company failed to fulfill the requirement to provide complete and transparent information to the persons concerned, which constitutes an essential prerequisite for any processing of personal data. 92. Concerning the failure to comply with the obligation to regulate by a formalized legal act the processing carried out on behalf of the data controller, the restricted panel notes that the company lacked rigor by not ensuring that it subscribed to a document contractual document containing the information required in Article 28 of the GDPR, thus depriving the persons concerned of benefiting from full protection of their personal data. 93. With regard to the failure to comply with the obligation to ensure the security of personal data, the restricted training highlights the number of failures observed to comply with basic security obligations, namely the use of a password and a insufficiently robust confidential reference for customer or user accounts, the unencrypted transmission of the confidential reference, the unencrypted storage of passwords and confidential references as well as the conservation of data in an active database. The restricted panel considers that the accumulation of these security flaws did not allow people to benefit from the full protection provided by the GDPR regarding the use of their data. 94. Finally, while taking into account that the company has implemented measures following notification of the sanction report, the restricted panel notes that these actions do not exempt the company from its liability for the breaches constituted for the past. 95. Consequently, the restricted panel considers that it is appropriate to impose an administrative fine for breaches of Articles 5-1-e), 13, 28 and 32 of the GDPR. 2. On the amount of the administrative fine 96. The restricted training first notes that breaches of Articles 5-1-e) and 13 of the GDPR constitute breaches of key principles of the GDPR likely to be subject, under Article 83 of the GDPR, to an administrative fine of up to 20,000,000 euros or up to 4% of annual turnover, whichever is higher. 97. The restricted panel notes that the company achieved, in 2022, a turnover of approximately \[…\] euros for a net result of \[…\]. 98. Therefore, with regard to the responsibility of the company, its financial capacities and the relevant criteria of article 83 of the Regulation, the restricted panel considers that an administrative fine of a total amount of one hundred thousand (100,000 ) euros for breaches of articles 5-1-e), 13, 28 and 32 of the GDPR appears justified. B. On advertising 99. The restricted panel considers that the publicity of this decision is justified in view of the seriousness of the breaches in question and the number of people concerned. It also considers that publicizing the sanction will notably make it possible to inform all those affected by the breaches. 100. Finally, the measure is proportionate since the decision will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: • pronounce against the company DE PARTICULIER A PARTICULIER – EDITIONS NERESSIS an administrative fine in the amount of one hundred thousand (100,000) euros for breaches of articles 5-1-e), 13, 28 and 32 of the regulations ( EU) No. 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 relating to data protection; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. President Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be the subject of an appeal before the Council of State within two months of its notification."

Facts and procedure 1. The company FORIOU (hereinafter ""the company""), whose head office is located at 23/25 avenue Kléber in Paris (16th), is a subsidiary of the company SFK GROUP. Its activity is the marketing and management of loyalty programs and cards. It does not employ any employees but relies, for the conduct of its activities, on the services of personnel from other companies in the group. The company indicated that it had identified \[…\] customers as of October 5, 2021. Its turnover for the year 2021 amounted to \[…\] euros, for a net loss of \[…\] euros. 2. In order to promote its programs, the company carried out, until 2021, telephone canvassing campaigns based on prospect files purchased from two main partners, the companies \[…\] and \[…\]. 3. On September 23, 2021, a delegation from the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties (hereinafter “the Commission” or “the CNIL”) carried out an inspection at the company’s premises, in order to verify the compliance with the provisions of law no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter ""the Data Protection Act"" or ""law of January 6, 1978 as amended"") and of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of personal data and the free movement of such data (hereinafter the “Regulation” or “GDPR”). 4. Report No. 2021-191/1, drawn up on the day of the inspection, was notified to the company on September 30, 2021. 5. The company communicated additional documents on October 5 and November 22, 2021. 6. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission, on April 4, 2022, appointed Ms. Valérie PEUGEOT as rapporteur on the basis of article 22 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended. 7. On June 8, 2023, the rapporteur sent a supplementary request to which the company responded on June 23, 2023. 8. On August 23, 2023, at the end of her investigation, the rapporteur notified the company of a report detailing the breaches of Articles 6 and 32 of the GDPR which she considered to have occurred in this case. This report proposed to the restricted panel to impose an administrative fine against the company. He also proposed that this decision be made public. 9. On September 29, 2023, the company produced observations in response to the sanction report. 10. The rapporteur responded to the company's observations on October 20, 2023. 11. On November 22, 2023, the rapporteur, in application of III of article 40 of decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 taken for the application of the Data Protection Act, informed the company and the president of restricted training that the investigation was closed. 12. The same day, the company was informed that the file was included on the agenda for the restricted training on December 7, 2023. 13. The restricted panel held a session on December 7, 2023. 14. By preliminary deliberation No. SAN-2023-020 of December 14, 2023, sent by email to the company the same day and notified by post on December 20, 2023, the restricted panel asked the company FORIOU and to the rapporteur the production of a complementary document, mentioned by the company during the meeting of December 7, 2023. 15. On December 21, 2023, the rapporteur communicated to the restricted panel a document entitled “leads\_701\_23-09-2021 \[…\]”. 16. On December 28, 2023, the company communicated to the restricted panel a document also entitled “leads\_701\_23-09-2021 \[…\]”. 17. In application of article 41 of decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019, a summons to the restricted training session of January 18, 2024 was notified to the company FORIOU on December 20, 2023. 18. The rapporteur and the company presented oral observations during the restricted training session. II. Reasons for decision A. On the failure to comply with the obligation to process data lawfully 19. Under the terms of Article 6 of the GDPR, “1. Processing is only lawful if, and to the extent that, at least one of the following conditions is met: a) the data subject has consented to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes; b) the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or for the execution of pre-contractual measures taken at the request of the data subject; c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; d) processing is necessary to safeguard the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person; e) the processing is necessary for the performance of a mission of public interest or relating to the exercise of public authority vested in the controller; (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, unless overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular when the person concerned is a child. 20. The restricted training recalls that commercial prospecting actions by telephone calls can be carried out on the legal basis of the legitimate interest of the company (f) or on that of consent (a). 21. In this case, the company indicated that it carried out commercial prospecting operations by telephone using prospect files purchased from several data providers, the latter collecting said data via participation forms in online competitions. 22. The restricted panel notes that the company was not able, either in its written observations or in its oral observations during the session, to indicate precisely on what legal basis it was relying to carry out such processing. . Under these conditions, the two legal bases likely to be applicable in this case will be examined successively. 1) On legitimate interest 23. The rapporteur maintains that, to base its commercial prospecting operations by telephone, the company cannot rely on the legal basis of legitimate interest referred to in point f) of Article 6, paragraph 1 of the GDPR. It thus notes, with regard to the participation forms for online competitions through which the company \[…\] collects the data of prospects which it resells to the company FORIOU, that the latter is not systematically mentioned in the list of partners likely to approach the persons concerned, and that the latter cannot legitimately expect to receive commercial offers from this company. 24. In defense, the company relies on the contractual commitments of the company \[…\], which provide that the company FORIOU must be mentioned among the recipients of the data collected. It considers that it cannot be held responsible for the shortcomings of its service provider, and produces an example of a form implemented by the company \[…\] containing a URL link to a list of partners, including the company SFAM ( a link to the latter's confidentiality policy allowing access to the complete list of companies belonging to the same group as SFAM, including the company FORIOU). Finally, the company claims to implement regular checks relating to the conformity of the files delivered. 25. The restricted training recalls that, if commercial prospecting by non-electronic means can be carried out on the basis of the legitimate interest of the company, the latter must ensure that the processing does not conflict with the rights and interests of the persons whose the data is processed, taking into account their reasonable expectations. 26. In this regard, recital 47 of the GDPR provides that: “\[…\] the existence of a legitimate interest should be the subject of a careful assessment, in particular in order to determine whether a data subject can reasonably expect , at the time and in the context of the collection of personal data, that these are subject to processing for a given purpose. The interests and fundamental rights of the person could, in particular, prevail on the interest of the controller when personal data are processed in circumstances where the data subjects have no reasonable expectation of further processing \[…\]. "". 27. The restricted training firstly notes that it follows from these provisions that, in its capacity as data controller, the FORIOU company is required to verify itself that the conditions allowing it to carry out commercial prospecting operations are united. In this regard, the responsibility of an organization could be held by considering that a simple contractual commitment from its data broker to respect the GDPR and the rules applicable to commercial prospecting did not constitute a sufficient measure (CNIL, FR , November 24, 2022, Sanction, No. D-SAN-2022-021, published). 28. Thus, with regard to the contractual commitments of the company \[...\] which the FORIOU company relies on, the restricted panel considers that the contractual obligations that may be imposed on suppliers cannot exempt the FORIOU company from its liability as responsible for processing, despite the possible existence of supplier liability. 29. Furthermore, with regard to the checks that the company claims to carry out on the forms from which the data are collected, the restricted training notes that it does not produce any element to attest to this, the contractual commitments of its suppliers do not not constituting a control measure as such. 30. In the present case, the restricted panel notes that certain competition forms from which the company \[...\] collects prospect data which it transmits to the company FORIOU do not allow the persons concerned to reasonably expect to receive commercial prospecting offers from this company. 31. Thus, with regard to the form accessible from the website \[…\], the restricted panel observes that the latter contains a hyperlink referring to a nominative list of partners and not to categories of partners. Thus, the persons concerned can legitimately expect that this list of partners is exhaustive. However, the said list does not mention the company FORIOU. 32. Concerning the forms present on the sites \[…\] (this form referring to the site \[…\]) and \[…\], the restricted training notes that they do not mention the list of partners or categories of partners to which the data is likely to be transmitted, and that they also do not contain any link allowing access to such a list. 33. The restricted panel considers that under these conditions, the protection of the interests, freedoms and fundamental rights of the persons concerned takes precedence over the legitimate interests of the company, and that the latter cannot therefore rely on the legal basis mentioned in Article 6, paragraph 1, f) to base its commercial prospecting operations by telephone. 2) On consent 34. The rapporteur considers that, to base its commercial prospecting operations by telephone, the company cannot rely on the legal basis of consent referred to in point a) of Article 6, paragraph 1, of the GDPR. It notes that the findings made by the delegation made it possible to establish that the data brokers from which the company FORIOU obtains its supplies collect said data via participation forms for online competitions, the design of which does not allow does not allow users to demonstrate their consent by a clear and unambiguous positive act, and strongly encourages them to accept the transmission of their data to the company's partners for prospecting purposes. 35. In defense, the company relies on the terms of the contract concluded with the company \[…\]. It takes note of the material findings, but indicates that, if the breaches exist, they are neither representative of a desire to ignore its obligations, nor of generalized practices. In this regard, it provides two examples of collection forms implemented by its suppliers, which it considers to be compliant. Finally, it reports checks carried out on the files following their provision by the service provider, and emphasizes the impossibility, given the volume of these files, of implementing a unitary check. 36. The restricted committee recalls that under the terms of Article 4, paragraph 11, of the GDPR, “consent” of the data subject means “any manifestation of will, free, specific, informed and unambiguous by which the data subject accepts, by a declaration or by a clear positive act, that personal data concerning him or her are subject to processing. 37. With regard to commercial prospecting operations, it emphasizes that when the prospects' data have not been collected directly from them by the prospecting organization, consent may have been obtained at the time of the initial collection of the data. given by the first-time collector, on behalf of the organization which will carry out subsequent prospecting operations. Failing this, it is up to the prospecting organization to obtain such consent before carrying out prospecting acts (CNIL, FR, November 24, 2022, Sanction, n°SAN-2022-021, published) 38. Firstly, with regard to the contractual commitments of the company \[...\] which the FORIOU company relies on, the restricted training refers to the elements developed in points 27 and 28. It further recalls that, if the intentional nature of the violation must be taken into account when deciding whether there is reason to impose a fine and when deciding its amount, it has no impact on the characterization of the breach, the latter possibly resulting from negligence. The same applies to the generalized nature or not of said breach. 39. Secondly, the restricted training recalls that the consent mentioned by the provisions of Article 6, paragraph 1, a) of the GDPR, which allows the processing of personal data to be based, can only result from a express consent of the user, given in full knowledge of the facts after adequate information on the use that will be made of their personal data. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the persons concerned have given unequivocal, specific, free and informed consent when collecting their personal data via competition participation forms. 40. The restricted training notes in this regard that the work carried out on the practices implemented in terms of cookies with regard to banners for collecting consent can usefully serve to assess in a more general manner the conditions for collecting free consent , unambiguous, specific and informed, and serve as a reference in matters of commercial prospecting when it is based on the collection of consent. 41. Furthermore, on the same conditions of consent, the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter ""CJEU"") specified, in its Planet49 GmbH decision: ""Article 7(a) of Directive -tive 95 provides that the consent of the data subject can make such processing lawful provided that this consent is ""undoubtedly"" given by the data subject. However, only active behavior on the part of this person with a view to manifesting consent is likely to fulfill this requirement” (CJEU, Grand Chamber, October 1, 2019, Planet49 GmbH, C-673/17, ECLI:EU:C:2019:801, §54). Therefore, it should be considered that if consent is not given without doubt, it must be considered as lacking, which makes the processing illegal for lack of legal basis. More precisely on the methods of collection, the CJEU states that ""the manifestation of will referred to in Article 2(h) of Directive 95/46 must, in particular, be ""specific"", in the sense that it must relate precisely to the data processing concerned and cannot be deduced from a manifestation of will having a distinct object. In this case, contrary to what Planet49 argued, the fact for a user to activate the button participation in the promotional game organized by this company cannot therefore be sufficient to consider that the user has validly given his consent to the placement of cookies"" (Idem, §§ 58-59). 42. Furthermore, the Council of State held that ""free, specific, informed and unequivocal consent can only be an express consent of the user, given in full knowledge of the facts and after adequate information on the use that will be made of his personal data."" (EC, 10th and 9th chambers combined, June 19, 2020, Google LLC, no. 430810, pt. 21). 43. The restricted training also notes, by way of example, that guidelines 5/2020 on consent, adopted on May 4, 2020 by the ""article 29"" working group (now the European Data Protection Board, hereinafter ""EDPS""), specify that the free nature of consent ""implies a choice and real control for the data subjects. As a general rule, the GDPR provides that if the data subject is not genuinely able to exercise a choice, feels forced to consent or will suffer significant negative consequences if he or she does not give consent, the consent is not valid \[…\] In general terms, any inappropriate pressure or influence exerted on the person concerned (which may manifest in different ways) preventing him from exercising his will will render the consent invalid. 44. By way of illustration and comparison, in its deliberation no. 2020-092 of September 17, 2020 adopting a recommendation proposing practical methods of compliance in the event of use of ""cookies and other tracers"", the Commission recommends that the organizations concerned ensure ""that users take the full measure of the options available to them, in particular through the design chosen and the information provided (§ 10) \[…\] In order not to induce mislead users, the Commission recommends that data controllers ensure that interfaces for collecting choices do not include potentially misleading design practices leading users to believe that their consent is obligatory or which visually highlight a choice rather than another. It is recommended to use buttons and font of the same size, offering the same ease of reading, and highlighted in the same way"" (§ 34). She adds that it is necessary ""to be careful that the information accompanying each actionable element allowing consent or refusal to be expressed is easily understandable and does not require efforts of concentration or interpretation on the part of the the user. Thus, it is particularly recommended to ensure that it is not written in such a way that a quick or careless reading could lead one to believe that the selected option produces the opposite of what users thought they were choosing."" (§ 23). Otherwise, the unequivocal nature of the consent would not be characterized. 45. The restricted training also recalls that studies carried out on the practices of digital interfaces, in particular concerning cookies, note the considerable impact of the appearance of consent collection banners on the choice of users, which can encourage them to make choices that do not reflect their preferences on data sharing. 46. In this case, it appears from the documents in the file that the companies \[…\] and \[…\], suppliers of prospect data to the company FORIOU, collect the data of the persons concerned (surname, first name, title, email address, mobile telephone number, date of birth and postal address) via participation forms in online competitions, in order to allow their partners to use them as part of their commercial prospecting. 47. Regarding the findings made by the delegation during the inspection, the restricted panel notes that the forms accessible from the websites \[…\], \[…\], \[…\] and \[…\] are presented in a similar manner. Under the fields allowing the persons concerned to enter their contact details (which are requested by the formulas ""fill in your details below if you win"" or ""fill in your details below to apply"") is located a button ""VALIDATE "", ""I VALIDATE"" or ""I ANSWER THE QUESTIONS TO APPLY"". Above or below this button, a text specifies that by clicking on it, the user declares to have read the company's data protection policy and accepts that the data collected will be used to send them offers. partners of the company. Hypertext links provide access to the data protection policy and the list of partners concerned. The end of the text specifies that if the user wishes to continue without receiving offers from the company's partners, they can click on a link present in the text (""click here""). 48. Thus, the user confronted with this form can either click on a button allowing both to validate their participation in the game and to accept that their data is used to send them offers from the company's partners, or click on the “click here” link allowing you to continue without receiving these offers. 49. The restricted panel considers that as designed, the proposed forms do not allow data subjects to validly express a choice reflecting their preferences regarding the transmission of data for commercial prospecting purposes. The overall overview of the interfaces particularly highlights the ""VALIDATE"", ""I VALIDATE"" or ""I ANSWER THE QUESTIONS TO APPLY"" button which, by its size and color, stands out from the other information provided. Likewise, its title evokes more the conclusion of the user journey rather than a transmission of data to partners. Finally, its location gives the impression that it must be clicked to complete registration and participate in the competition. Conversely, the hypertext link allowing you to participate in the game without accepting the transmission of your data to partners is presented in the body of the text, in characters of a size significantly smaller than that used for the buttons and without particular emphasis, so that it does not appear intuitive that it is possible to participate without clicking on one of the aforementioned buttons and therefore without transmitting your data to third parties for prospecting purposes. The consent obtained is therefore devoid of an unequivocal and free nature. 50. The restricted panel also notes that, as part of its written observations, the company produced two other forms, presented as compliant. However, the restricted panel notes that their design does not allow the persons concerned to demonstrate their consent by a clear and unambiguous positive act. 51. On the one hand, the restricted panel observes that the presentation of these forms, like those consulted by the delegation during the on-site inspection, particularly highlights the ""VALIDATE MY CONTACT INFORMATION"" and ""CONTINUE"" button, to validate participation in the game and transmit data to partners. On the contrary, the hypertext link ""click here"" allowing you to participate in the game without accepting this transmission is presented in the body of the text, in characters of a size significantly smaller than that of the button and without particular emphasis. In addition, the overall visual of the form accessible from the site \[…\], which contains three green inserts (“I VALIDATE MY PARTICIPATION”, “I CONFIRM MY DETAILS FOR DELIVERY IN CASE OF WIN” and “VALIDATE MY CONTACT DETAILS”) leads us to believe that there is a logical sequencing between these three actions and that the ""VALIDATE MY CONTACT INFORMATION"" button is the last button to activate to participate in the game and obtain your winnings. However, this button is not obligatory since the user can use the aforementioned link ""click here"", which is not intuitive given the general appearance of the form. 52. In addition, with regard to the form implemented by the company \[…\] from the site \[…\], the restricted training notes the existence of two boxes to check, one concerning reading and acceptance of the rules of the game, the other reading the confidentiality policy and accepting the transmission of their data. The similar appearance of these boxes, presented as legal notices that must be read, and whose accompanying text begins with ""I have read"", pushes the user to check them indiscriminately, then to click on ""CONTINUE"" in transmitting its data. The possibility of participating in the draw without receiving promotional offers exists by clicking on the link ""here"" but is written in a smaller font and without emphasis compared to the ""CONTINUE"" button which on the one hand, is particularly visible by its size, color and font, on the other hand, seems to conclude the user journey due to its location at the bottom of the form. Thus, the optional nature of the “CONTINUE” button is not clearly deduced from the overall visual of the form. 53. On the other hand, the restricted training notes that an online check carried out on October 17, 2023 revealed that, given its configuration, the form referred to in the preceding paragraph did not materially allow the user to participate to the game without accepting the transmission of their data to the company's partners, and therefore without being the recipient of commercial prospecting, contrary to what is indicated on the form. 54. The restricted panel thus considers that the above-mentioned forms do not sufficiently inform the persons concerned of the fact that they consent to the transmission of their data for commercial prospecting purposes, in a context where the very purpose of these sites web is to offer a prospect of earnings which cannot suggest the objective of long-term collection of this data for such purposes. These people are not able to demonstrate their consent by a clear and unambiguous positive act. 55. Third and last, with regard to the checks that the company claims to carry out on the files delivered, the restricted panel observes that the company does not produce any evidence to attest to this. 56. On the one hand, in its written observations of September 29, 2023, then in its oral observations during the meeting of December 7, 2023, the company mentioned a document entitled ""leads\_701\_23-09-2021 \[…\]"", collected during on-site inspection and reporting, according to it, ""checks of the prospecting files carried out following their provision by the service provider"". By deliberation no. SAN-2023-020 of December 14, 2023, the restricted panel requested the rapporteur and the company to produce this document. 57. The restricted panel notes that the file produced by the rapporteur, the digital fingerprint of which certifies that it is indeed the file from which the findings were made by the delegation during the inspection, does not contain any element of a nature to certify the verifications relied upon by the company. In accordance with what is mentioned on the inspection report, this is a file of prospects (“leads”) delivered by the company \[…\] to the INDEXIA group on September 23, 2021, containing the data of approximately 15,000 prospects. If, for each of these prospects, a URL link allowing access to the source of the data is present, the restricted training notes that no mention is made of verifications which could have been carried out by the FORIOU company or the INDEXIA group . During the meeting of January 18, 2024, the company indicated that it would not question the integrity of this part. 58. Regarding the file produced by the company, the restricted panel notes that it does not correspond to that collected during the inspection, insofar as its digital footprint and its size differ. It further notes that this difference is confirmed by its content since, contrary to the findings appearing in the minutes of September 23, 2021, it does not contain any prospect data but only URL links accompanied by comments (""ok"", ""only one check box"", ""disputed""). 59. Finally, the restricted panel observes that the content of the file produced does not appear consistent with the purpose invoked insofar as the summary and undated comments which appear therein are not linked to any prospect sheet and that it is not Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that the non-conformities identified would have been reported to the company \[…\]. The restricted training thus considers that in any case, such a file does not make it possible to demonstrate the existence of checks carried out on the files delivered. 60. On the other hand, with regard to the other documents in the file, the restricted panel notes that they attest exclusively to requirements imposed by the company FORIOU on the company \[…\], prior to the resumption of their contractual relations, without constitute controls by the company FORIOU on the subsequent practices of its service provider. 61. The restricted panel notes in any case that the proportion of non-compliant files among those randomly examined by the delegation (i.e. four non-compliant files out of the seven examined) demonstrates the insufficiency of the measures taken by the company to ensure the validity of the consent of the persons concerned. 62. Therefore, in the absence of a legal basis allowing the FORIOU company to base its commercial prospecting operations by telephone, the restricted panel considers that a breach of Article 6 of the GDPR has occurred. B. On the failure to comply with the obligation to ensure data security 63. Under the terms of Article 32, paragraph 1 of the GDPR, ""taking into account the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks, the degree of probability and severity of which varies, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee a level of security adapted to the risk \[ …\] ""and in particular ""means to guarantee the constant confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services"" and a ""procedure aimed at regularly testing, analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing"". 64. The rapporteur notes that the company indicated that it kept its customers' data for a period of five years from the date of closing of the contract, in accordance with the legal limitation periods, specifying that this data was kept on an active basis, without that no intermediate archiving mechanism is implemented. The rapporteur considers that these storage arrangements do not make it possible to limit access to data to users with a need to know, to the extent that people with an interest in having access to this data during the duration of the contract continue, even after the closure of the latter, to be able to access it without restriction for a period of five years, even though their functions no longer necessarily require them to know about it. 65. In defense, the company does not deny keeping its customers' data for a period of five years from the end of the contractual relationship, nor the absence of intermediate archiving, but considers that the notion of ""basic active"" constitutes restrictive terminology insofar as the information accessible during the life of a contract remains, for the vast majority of it, still necessary even after the latter has been closed. She also underlines that the implementation of intermediate archiving measures raises the question of the relationship between the human and financial investment effort that would be necessary and the limited gain that would result. 66. The restricted training recalls that it follows from the provisions of Article 32 of the GDPR that the data controller must put in place appropriate measures to ensure the confidentiality of the data and prevent them from being processed unlawfully by the fact of people who do not need to know (CNIL, FR, October 29, 2021, Sanction, n°SAN-2021-019, published). 67. This need to know is likely to evolve depending on the life cycle of the data and the purposes for which they are kept. Thus, during the phase of their current use, which corresponds to the duration necessary to accomplish the determined purpose, the data are kept on an ""active basis"" and accessible to all the services responsible for implementing the processing. At the end of this phase, when the data is no longer used to achieve the set objective but it still presents an administrative interest for the organization (for example for the management of possible litigation) or must be kept to meet a legal obligation, they must be able to be consulted only on an ad hoc and motivated basis by specifically authorized persons, participating in the objective which justified this conservation, by being the subject of intermediate archiving. This intermediate archiving requires a separation from the active database, which can be physical (via a transfer of data within a dedicated archive database), or logical (via the implementation of technical and organizational measures guaranteeing that only people with an interest in processing the data due to their functions can access it). 68. The restricted panel notes that the company does not dispute retaining its customers' data at the end of the contractual relationship, without any intermediate archiving measure taking place. The restricted training recalls that the termination of contractual relations must lead to limiting access to data to certain employees due to their functions. However, the restricted panel considers that as it stands, the elements in the file do not make it possible to establish that people would have access to said data without needing to know it. 69. It follows from the above that there is no breach of Article 32 of the GDPR. III. On the issuance of corrective measures and publicity 70. Under the terms of article 20 of law no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended: ""When the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or this law, the president of the National Commission for Information Technology and Freedoms may \[…\] refer the matter to the restricted formation of the commission with a view to pronouncing, after contradictory procedure, one or more of the measures following: \[…\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the figure total global annual business of the previous financial year, the highest amount being retained. In the hypotheses mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased , respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted body takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83 "". 71. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that: ""Each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this article for violations of this regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective , proportionate and dissuasive"", before specifying the elements to be taken into account when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and when deciding the amount of this fine. 72. Firstly, the restricted panel recalls that it must take into account, when issuing an administrative fine, the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, seriousness and duration of the violation. , whether the violation was deliberate or not, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and the categories of personal data affected by the violation . 73. The restricted training underlines that the breach committed by the company relates to obligations relating to the fundamental principles of the protection of personal data. 74. Indeed, the restricted training recalls that the consequence of failure to comply with the obligation to have a legal basis for processing prospects' data in the context of commercial prospecting by telephone is to deprive the operations concerned of lawfulness. 75. She underlines that, if the company intends to base these on the legal basis of consent, the ecosystem of the resale of data from partners to partners requires particularly strong guarantees as to the quality and validity of the consent obtained by the first-time data collector and which partners use for commercial prospecting purposes. It emphasizes that in this regard, the organization which avails itself of such consent to carry out commercial prospecting operations assumes an essential responsibility requiring it, as data controller, to ensure that the conditions enabling it to carrying out said operations are combined, regardless of the possible liability of the data providers, primary collectors. The restricted training considers that these requirements must be particularly reinforced with regard to the methods of obtaining the consent of users of websites whose purpose is to offer prospects of earning, these people not necessarily being aware of the scope of their agreement as part of their registration. 76. The restricted training also recalls the importance, in the absence of obtaining valid consent, of allowing the persons concerned to measure the extent of the processing to which their data is likely to be subject. Thus, the fact that at the time of data collection, a detailed list of partners likely to carry out commercial prospecting operations is made available to the persons concerned, without the FORIOU company appearing there, and without this list being supplemented by a statement specifying the categories of partners of which the company FORIOU could be a part, deprives the persons concerned of the minimum information base allowing them to preserve their interests, freedoms and fundamental rights. 77. The restricted training emphasizes the fact that the company FORIOU, as a subsidiary of the company SFK GROUP, has sufficient human, financial and technical resources to ensure compliance with the rules relating to the protection of personal data . 78. Finally, the restricted training intends to take into account \[…\] 79. In view of all of these elements, the restricted panel considers that it is appropriate to impose an administrative fine for the breach of Article 6 of the GDPR. 80. Secondly, with regard to the amount of the administrative fine, the restricted committee recalls that the violation noted in this case concerns a breach likely to be subject, under Article 83 of the GDPR, to an administrative fine of up to 20 million euros or up to 4% of the global annual turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher. 81. It considers that the activity of the company and its financial situation must in particular be taken into account. It notes in this regard that for the year 2021, the company achieved a turnover of \[…\] euros, for an operating profit of \[…\] euros. The restricted committee notes that, if the company presents a net loss of \[…\] euros, it is only due to a waiver of debt of \[…\] euros to the INDEXIA group. Furthermore, as this exceptional result is not deductible, the FORIOU company was subject, for the year 2021, to an amount of \[…\] euros in corporate tax. Taking into account all of these elements, the restricted panel considers that the financial situation of the company is healthy. 82. Therefore, with regard to the liability of the company, its financial capacities and the relevant criteria of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the GDPR mentioned above, the restricted panel considers that a fine of three hundred and ten one thousand euros (€310,000) appears justified. 83. Thirdly, with regard to the publicity of the sanction, the restricted panel considers that this is justified in view of the seriousness of the breach in question, the position of the company on the market, the scope of the treatment and the number of people affected. 84. It also notes that this measure is intended in particular to inform the people concerned by the company's prospecting operations. This information will allow them, if necessary, to assert their rights. 85. Finally, it considers that this measure is proportionate since the decision will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: • impose an administrative fine against the company FORIOU in the amount of three hundred and ten thousand euros (€310,000) for breach of article 6 of the GDPR; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer allow the company to be identified by name after a period of two years from its publication. President Alexandre LINDEN This decision may be the subject of an appeal before the Council of State within two months of its notification."

Facts and procedure 1. The company HUBSIDE.STORE (hereinafter ""the company""), whose head office is located at 23/25 avenue Kléber in Paris (16th), is a subsidiary of the company SFK GROUP. Its activity is the management of “HUBSIDE.STORE” stores, specializing in the retail trade of telecommunications equipment. As of May 31, 2023, the company employed 706 employees and had 97 stores, spread across France, Belgium, Portugal and Italy. Its turnover for the year 2021 amounted to approximately \[…\] euros, for a net result of \[…\] euros. 2. In order to promote the catalog of products sold in stores, the company carries out canvassing campaigns by telephone and SMS based on prospect files purchased from two main partners, the companies \[…\] and \[…\]. It indicated having sent approximately 1.4 million SMS messages between September 2020 and September 2021, and more than 220,000 between May 2022 and May 2023. Regarding telephone prospecting, the company indicated having made approximately 3.2 million calls between May 2022 and May 2023, to approximately 1.3 million prospects. 3. On September 23, 2021, a delegation from the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties (hereinafter “the CNIL” or “the Commission”) carried out an inspection at the company's premises, in order to verify the compliance with the provisions of law no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended relating to data processing, files and freedoms (hereinafter ""the Data Protection Act"" or ""law of January 6, 1978 as amended"") and of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of personal data and the free movement of such data (hereinafter the “Regulation” or “GDPR”). 4. Report No. 2021-191/1, drawn up on the day of the inspection, was notified to the company on September 30, 2021. 5. The company communicated additional documents on October 5 and November 22, 2021. 6. For the purposes of examining these elements, the President of the Commission, on April 4, 2022, appointed Ms. Valérie PEUGEOT as rapporteur on the basis of article 22 of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended. 7. In accordance with Article 56 of the GDPR, on June 9, 2023, the CNIL informed all European supervisory authorities of its competence to act as lead supervisory authority regarding cross-border processing implemented by the company, resulting from the fact that the company's main establishment is in France. After discussions between the CNIL and the European data protection authorities as part of the one-stop shop mechanism, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium declared themselves concerned. 8. On June 8 and July 13, 2023, the rapporteur sent two additional requests to which the company responded on June 23 and August 3, 2023. 9. On August 23, 2023, at the end of her investigation, the rapporteur notified the company of a report detailing the breaches of articles 6, 14 and 32 of the GDPR and article L. 34-5 of the code of Posts and Electronic Communications (hereinafter ""the CPCE"") which it considered constituted in this case. This report proposed to the restricted panel to impose an administrative fine against the company. He also proposed that this decision be made public. 10. On September 29, 2023, the company produced observations in response to the sanction report. 11. The rapporteur responded to the company's comments on October 20, 2023. 12. On November 22, 2023, the rapporteur, in application of III of article 40 of decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 taken for the application of the Data Protection Act, informed the company and the president of restricted training that the investigation was closed. 13. The same day, the company was informed that the file was included on the agenda for the restricted training on December 7, 2023. 14. The restricted panel held a session on December 7, 2023. 15. By preliminary deliberation No. SAN-2023-019 of December 14, 2023, sent by email to the company the same day and notified by post on December 21, 2023, the restricted panel requested the company HUBSIDE. STORE and the rapporteur the production of a complementary document, mentioned by the company during the meeting of December 7, 2023. 16. On December 21, 2023, the rapporteur communicated to the restricted panel a document entitled “leads\_701\_23-09-2021 \[…\]”. 17. On December 28, 2023, the company communicated to the restricted panel a document also entitled “leads\_701\_23-09-2021 \[…\]”. 18. Pursuant to article 41 of decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019, a summons to the restricted training session of January 18, 2024 was notified to the company HUBSIDE.STORE on December 21, 2023; 19. The rapporteur and the company presented oral observations during the restricted training session. II. Reasons for decision A. On the appointment of the rapporteur 20. Under the terms of article 39 of decree no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019, ""when a measure provided for in III of article 20 of the law of January 6, 1978 \[…\] is likely to be pronounced , the president of the commission appoints a rapporteur who does not belong to the restricted group, and informs the data controller or the subcontractor in question. 21. The restricted formation notes that in application of these provisions, the president of the CNIL has, by decision of April 7, 2022, designated Ms. Valérie PEUGEOT, commissioner, to draw up the report to enable the restricted formation to adopt its decision as part of the file “CTX n°2022-019 HUBSIDE.STORE”. 22. During the meeting of December 7, 2023, then as part of its observations of December 28, 2023, the company HUBSIDE.STORE invoked the nullity of this designation, to the extent that it would have taken place on the basis of a referral not concerning the company HUBSIDE.STORE. 23. The restricted panel notes that on July 1, 2020, the CNIL was notified of a complaint no.\[...\] targeting several companies in the SFK group. 24. By decision no. 2021-191 of June 29, 2021, the president of the CNIL instructed the secretary general to carry out or have carried out a verification mission of the processing implemented by the company SFK GROUP or by its subsidiaries. 25. The control report dated September 23, 2021 indicates that “the purpose of the control mission is to carry out on-site verification of the conformity of the processing of personal data implemented by the company SFK GROUP or by its subsidiaries and in particular the companies \[…\] and \[…\]"". It specifies that “in particular, it was a question of carrying out verifications subsequent to the closings of May 4, 2021 of the formal notices MED n°2020-041 of November 24, 2020 against the company \[…\] and MED n°2020-042 of November 24, 2020 against the company…\]; it also involved following up on the referral \[…\] relating to the exercise of his right of access by a complainant” . 26. The restricted panel considers that, to the extent that the referral \[...\] gave rise to checks carried out during the on-site inspection on September 23, 2021, which targeted the SFK group and all of its subsidiaries, of which the company HUBSIDE.STORE, the fact that this referral is mentioned in the decision of the president to appoint Ms. Valérie PEUGEOT as rapporteur has no impact on the validity of this designation, even if said referral does not specifically target the company HUBSIDE.STORE .STORE. B. On the European cooperation procedure 27. Under Article 4(23)(b) of the GDPR, “cross-border processing” means “processing of personal data which takes place in the Union in the context of the activities of a single establishment of 'a controller or a processor, but which materially affects or is likely to materially affect data subjects in more than one Member State.' 28. The rapporteur notes that the company has stores in France, but also in Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Italy. It observes that, although the company indicated that its commercial prospecting operations were carried out exclusively from France, intended for French nationals, it nevertheless transmitted recordings of prospecting calls intended for Belgian nationals, with the aim of to promote its stores located in Belgium. Furthermore, the rapporteur notes that the company also indicated that its customer database contained all the data of customers of HUBSIDE.STORE stores in Europe. It considers that, therefore, the company implements cross-border processing of personal data. 29. In defense, with regard to commercial prospecting operations by telephone, the company states that it only carries out prospecting with individuals domiciled in France, in order to generate traffic in its points of sale located in France. Regarding the recordings of calls to Belgian nationals transmitted to the delegation, it specifies that ""HUBSIDE.STORE Belgium, the lead entity carrying out the activities of HUBSIDE.STORE in Belgium, does not have staff dedicated to animation Also, for telephone or SMS prospecting operations carried out with the aim of generating traffic in points of sale located on Belgian territory, HUBSIDE.STORE Belgium was able to subcontract this prospecting activity to SFAM using the services of the French commercial platforms of this company From then on, the teams responsible for prospecting were provided with access to a Belgian prospecting file, acquired from HUBSIDE.STORE Belgium. 30. Firstly, with regard to commercial prospecting operations by telephone covered by the breach of Article 6 of the GDPR, the restricted training notes that this breach is based on the design of forms implemented by data brokers not providing the company HUBSIDE.STORE with data from French nationals only. Under these conditions, despite the company carrying out cold calling for Belgian nationals, the restricted panel considers that the processing concerned by the breach of Article 6 of the GDPR does not constitute cross-border processing. 31. Secondly, with regard to the recordings of telephone prospecting calls covered by the breach of Article 14 of the GDPR, the restricted panel notes that the latter target French nationals but also Belgian nationals, in order to promote stores located in Belgium. Thus, the cross-border nature of the processing appears characterized. 32. Third and last, the company indicated that its customer database, targeted by the breach of Article 32 of the GDPR, contained customer data from all HUBSIDE.STORE points of sale in Europe. The restricted training therefore considers that the management of this database constitutes cross-border processing within the meaning of Article 4, paragraph 23, of the GDPR. 33. Pursuant to Article 60(3) of the GDPR, the draft decision adopted by the restricted panel was transmitted to the other competent European supervisory authorities, with a view to enabling them to make relevant and reasoned objections on the processing and breaches which concern them, on February 20, 2024. The restricted panel notes that the following supervisory authorities are concerned by this procedure: Belgium, Italy, Spain, Portugal. 34. As of March 20, 2024, none of these authorities had formulated a relevant and reasoned objection to this draft decision, so that, pursuant to Article 60(6) of the GDPR, these the latter are deemed to have approved it. C. On the failure to comply with the obligation to obtain the consent of the persons concerned for the implementation of commercial prospecting by electronic means 35. Under the terms of article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, “direct prospecting by means of an automated electronic communications system \[…\], a fax machine or e-mails using the contact details of a natural person is prohibited \[…\] who has not previously expressed consent to receive direct marketing by this means For the purposes of this article, consent means any manifestation of free, specific and informed will by which a person accepts that data. of a personal nature concerning it are used for the purpose of direct prospecting \[…\] "". 36. Under the terms of Article 4(11) of the GDPR, “consent” of the data subject means “any free, specific, informed and unambiguous expression of will by which the data subject accepts, by a declaration or by a clear positive act, that personal data concerning them are subject to processing"". 37. In application of the combined provisions of articles L.34-5 of the CPCE and 4, paragraph 11 of the GDPR, the organization which carries out commercial prospecting operations by electronic means must have unambiguous, specific, free and informed of the persons concerned. 38. The rapporteur notes that the company has indicated that it carries out commercial prospecting operations by SMS using prospect files purchased from data brokers. It observes that the findings made by the delegation made it possible to establish that these brokers collected the data of the persons concerned via participation forms in online competitions. 39. To propose to the restricted panel to consider that the company has failed to comply with its obligations resulting from article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, as clarified by the provisions of article 4, paragraph 11 of the GDPR, the rapporteur is based on the fact that the design of these forms does not allow users to demonstrate their consent by a clear and unambiguous positive act, and strongly encourages them to accept the transmission of their data to the company's partners for purposes prospecting. 40. In defense, the company relies on the terms of the contract linking it to one of its suppliers, the company \[…\], believing that it cannot be held responsible for the non-compliant actions of its service provider. Regarding the other supplier, the company \[…\], it indicates that it did not have any contractual relationship with it before November 2021 and that the majority of files received came from the company \[…\], completed by contributions from the company \[…\] itself using a network of subcontractors including the company \[…\]. 41. In this case, it appears from the instruction that the company HUBSIDE.STORE carries out commercial prospecting operations by SMS based on prospect files purchased from data providers, responsible for collecting the consent of the persons concerned at the time of data collection. Between September 2020 and September 2021, 1,363,773 prospecting SMS messages were sent. The number of shipments between May 2022 and May 2023 amounts to 221,206. 42. Firstly, with regard to the company \[…\], the restricted panel notes that during the inspection on September 23, 2021, the company indicated that “prospecting SMS messages relating to the catalog of the company HUBSIDE.STORE are sent to the prospects provided by the company \[…\] because the latter is able to target prospects close to the stores"". On this occasion, an extraction of 5,000 prospect files provided by the company \[…\] was carried out. Furthermore, the company provided the delegation with two purchase orders from the company \[…\], dated August 3, 2021, relating to the sale of several tens of thousands of files to the company HUBSIDE.STORE. 43. These elements lead the restricted panel to consider that the company HUBSIDE.STORE was indeed using, on the day of the inspection, the prospect files delivered by the company \[…\]. 44. Secondly, the restricted training recalls that when the prospects' data have not been collected directly from them by the prospecting organization, consent may have been obtained at the time of the initial collection of the data by the prospecting organization. first-time collector, on behalf of the organization which will carry out subsequent prospecting operations. Failing this, it is up to the prospecting organization to obtain such consent before carrying out prospecting acts (CNIL, FR, November 24, 2022, Sanction, n°SAN-2022-021, published). 45. As a result, in its capacity as data controller, the company HUBSIDE.STORE is required to verify itself that the conditions allowing it to carry out commercial prospecting operations are met. In this regard, the restricted training held the responsibility of an organization by considering that a simple contractual commitment from its data broker to respect the GDPR and the rules applicable to commercial prospecting did not constitute a sufficient measure (CNIL, FR, November 24, 2022, Sanction, No. SAN-2022-021, published). 46. Thus, with regard to the contractual commitments of the company \[...\] which the company HUBSIDE.STORE relies on, the restricted panel considers that the contractual obligations that may be imposed on suppliers cannot exempt the company HUBSIDE.STORE from its liability in as data controller, despite the possible existence of supplier liability. 47. Thirdly, the restricted panel recalls that the specific consent required by the provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE can only result from express consent from the user, given in full knowledge of the facts after adequate information on the use that will be made of their personal data. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the persons concerned have given unequivocal, specific, free and informed consent when collecting their personal data via competition participation forms. 48. The restricted training notes in this regard that the work carried out on the practices implemented in terms of cookies with regard to banners for collecting consent can usefully serve to assess in a more general way the conditions for collecting free consent , unambiguous, specific and informed, and serve as a reference in matters of commercial prospecting when it is based on the collection of consent. 49. Furthermore, on the same conditions of consent, the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter ""CJEU"") specified, in its Planet49 GmbH decision: ""Article 7, sub a) of the Directive 95 provides that the consent of the data subject can make such processing lawful as long as this consent is ""undoubtedly"" given by the data subject. However, only active behavior on the part of this person with a view to manifesting his consent is. nature to fulfill this requirement” (CJEU, Grand Chamber, October 1, 2019, Planet49 GmbH, C-673/17, ECLI:EU:C:2019:801, §54). Therefore, it should be considered that if consent is not given without doubt, it must be considered as lacking, which makes the processing illegal for lack of legal basis. More precisely on the methods of collection, the CJEU states that ""the manifestation of will referred to in Article 2(h) of Directive 95/46 must, in particular, be ""specific"", in the sense that it must relate precisely to the data processing concerned and cannot be inferred from a manifestation of will having a distinct object. In this case, contrary to what Planet49 argued, the fact of a user activating the button. participation in the promotional game organized by this company cannot therefore be sufficient to consider that the user has validly given consent to the placement of cookies” (Idem, §§ 58-59). 50. Furthermore, the Council of State held that ""free, specific, informed and unequivocal consent can only be an express consent of the user, given in full knowledge of the facts and after adequate information on the use that will be made of his personal data "" (CE, 10th and 9th chambers combined, June 19, 2020, Google LLC, no. 430810, pt. 21). 51. The restricted training also notes, by way of example, that guidelines 5/2020 on consent, adopted on May 4, 2020 by the ""article 29"" working group (now the European Data Protection Board, hereinafter ""EDPS""), specify that the free nature of consent ""implies a choice and real control for the data subjects. As a general rule, the GDPR provides that if the data subject is not genuinely able to exercise a choice, feels forced to consent or will suffer significant negative consequences if he or she does not give consent, the consent is not valid \[…\] In general terms, any inappropriate pressure or influence exerted on the person concerned (which may manifest in different ways) preventing him from exercising his will will render the consent invalid. 52. By way of illustration and comparison, in its deliberation no. 2020-092 of September 17, 2020 adopting a recommendation proposing practical methods of compliance in the event of use of ""cookies and other tracers"", the Commission recommends that the organizations concerned ensure ""that users take the full measure of the options available to them, in particular through the design chosen and the information provided (§ 10) \[…\] In order not to induce mislead users, the Commission recommends that data controllers ensure that interfaces for collecting choices do not include potentially misleading design practices leading users to believe that their consent is obligatory or which visually highlight a choice rather than another It is recommended to use buttons and a font of the same size, offering the same ease of reading, and highlighted in the same way” (§ 34). She adds that it is necessary ""to be careful that the information accompanying each actionable element allowing consent or refusal to be expressed is easily understandable and does not require efforts of concentration or interpretation on the part of the the user, it is particularly recommended to ensure that it is not written in such a way that a quick or careless reading could lead one to believe that the selected option produces the opposite of what the users expect. thought to choose” (§ 23). Otherwise, the unequivocal nature of the consent would not be characterized. 53. The restricted training also recalls that studies carried out on the practices of digital interfaces, in particular concerning cookies, note the considerable impact of the appearance of consent collection banners on the choice of users, which can encourage them to make choices that do not reflect their preferences on data sharing. 54. In this case, it appears from the documents in the file that the companies \[…\] and \[…\], suppliers of prospect data to the company HUBSIDE.STORE, collect the data of the persons concerned (surname, first name, title, address electronic mail, mobile telephone number, date of birth and postal address) via participation forms in online competitions, in order to allow their partners to use them as part of their commercial prospecting. 55. Regarding the findings made by the delegation during the inspection, the restricted panel notes that the forms accessible from the websites \[…\], \[…\], \[…\] and \[…\] are presented in a similar manner. Under the fields allowing the persons concerned to enter their contact details (which are requested by the formulas ""fill in your details below in case of winning"" or ""fill in your details below to apply"") is located a button ""VALIDATE "", ""I VALIDATE"" or ""I ANSWER THE QUESTIONS TO APPLY"". Above or below this button, a text specifies that by clicking on it, the user declares to have read the company's data protection policy and accepts that the data collected will be used to send them offers. partners of the company. Hypertext links provide access to the data protection policy and the list of partners concerned. The end of the text specifies that if the user wishes to continue without receiving offers from the company's partners, they can click on a link present in the text (""click here""). 56. Thus, the user confronted with this form can either click on a button allowing both to validate their participation in the game and to accept that their data is used to send them offers from the company's partners, or click on the “click here” link allowing you to continue without receiving these offers. 57. The restricted panel considers that as designed, the proposed forms do not allow data subjects to validly express a choice reflecting their preferences regarding the transmission of data for commercial prospecting purposes. The overall overview of the interfaces particularly highlights the ""VALIDATE"", ""I VALIDATE"" or ""I ANSWER THE QUESTIONS TO APPLY"" button which, by its size and color, stands out from the other information provided. Likewise, its title evokes more the conclusion of the user journey rather than a transmission of data to partners. Finally, its location gives the impression that it must be clicked to complete registration and participate in the competition. Conversely, the hypertext link allowing you to participate in the game without accepting the transmission of your data to partners is presented in the body of the text, in characters of a size significantly smaller than that used for the buttons and without any particular emphasis, so that it does not appear intuitive that it is possible to participate without clicking on one of the aforementioned buttons and therefore without transmitting your data to third parties for prospecting purposes. The consent obtained is therefore devoid of an unequivocal and free character. 58. The restricted panel also notes that, as part of its written observations relating to the breach of Article 6 of the GDPR, the company produced two other forms, presented as compliant. However, the restricted panel notes that their design does not allow the persons concerned to demonstrate their consent by a clear and unambiguous positive act. 59. On the one hand, the restricted panel observes that the presentation of these forms, like those consulted by the delegation during the on-site inspection, particularly highlights the ""VALIDATE MY CONTACT INFORMATION"" and ""CONTINUE"" button, to validate participation in the game and transmit data to partners. On the contrary, the hypertext link ""click here"" allowing you to participate in the game without accepting this transmission is presented in the body of the text, in characters of a size significantly smaller than that of the button and without any particular emphasis. In addition, the overall visual of the form accessible from the site \[…\], which contains three green inserts (“I VALIDATE MY PARTICIPATION”, “I CONFIRM MY DETAILS FOR DELIVERY IN CASE OF WIN” and “VALIDATE MY CONTACT DETAILS”) leads us to believe that there is a logical sequencing between these three actions and that the “VALIDATE MY CONTACT INFORMATION” button is the last button to activate to participate in the game and obtain your winnings. However, this button is not obligatory since the user can use the aforementioned link ""click here"", which is not intuitive given the general appearance of the form. 60. In addition, with regard to the form implemented by the company \[…\] from the site \[…\], the restricted training notes the existence of two boxes to check, one concerning reading and acceptance of the rules of the game, the other reading the confidentiality policy and accepting the transmission of their data. The similar appearance of these boxes, presented as legal notices that must be read, and whose accompanying text begins with ""I have read"", pushes the user to check them indiscriminately, then to click on ""CONTINUE"" in transmitting its data. The possibility of participating in the draw without receiving promotional offers exists by clicking on the link ""here"" but is written in a smaller font and without emphasis compared to the ""CONTINUE"" button which, on the one hand, is particularly visible, by its size, its color and its font, on the other hand, seems to conclude the user journey due to its location at the bottom of the form. Thus, the optional nature of the “CONTINUE” button is not clearly deduced from the overall visual of the form. 61. On the other hand, the restricted training notes that an online check carried out on October 17, 2023 revealed that, given its configuration, the form referred to in the previous paragraph did not materially allow the user to participate to the game without accepting the transmission of their data to the company's partners, and therefore without being the recipient of commercial prospecting, contrary to what is indicated on the form. 62. The restricted panel thus considers that the above-mentioned forms do not sufficiently inform the persons concerned of the fact that they consent to the transmission of their data for commercial prospecting purposes, in a context where the very purpose of these sites web is to offer a prospect of earnings which cannot suggest the objective of long-term collection of this data for such purposes. These people are not able to demonstrate their consent by a clear and unambiguous positive act. 63. The restricted panel considers, under these conditions, that the company HUBSIDE.STORE does not have, to carry out its commercial prospecting operations electronically, valid consent within the meaning of articles L.34-5 of the CPCE and 4 of the GDPR. 64. A breach of article L.34-5 of the CPCE is thus characterized. D. On the failure to comply with the obligation to process data lawfully 65. Under the terms of Article 6 of the GDPR, “1. Processing is only lawful if, and to the extent that, at least one of the following conditions is met: a) the data subject has consented to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes; b) the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or for the execution of pre-contractual measures taken at the request of the data subject; c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; d) processing is necessary to safeguard the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person; e) the processing is necessary for the performance of a mission of public interest or relating to the exercise of public authority vested in the controller; (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, unless overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular when the person concerned is a child. 66. The restricted training recalls that commercial prospecting actions by telephone calls can be carried out on the legal basis of the legitimate interest of the company (f) or on that of consent (a). 67. In this case, the company indicated that it carried out commercial prospecting operations by telephone, using prospect files purchased from several data providers. 68. The restricted panel notes that the company was not able, either in its written observations or in its oral observations during the session, to indicate precisely on what legal basis it was relying to carry out such processing. . Under these conditions, the two legal bases likely to be applicable in this case will be examined successively. 1) On legitimate interest 69. The rapporteur maintains that, to base its commercial prospecting operations by telephone, the company cannot rely on the legal basis of legitimate interest referred to in point f) of Article 6, paragraph 1 of the GDPR. It thus notes, with regard to the participation forms for online competitions through which the company \[...\] collects data from prospects which it resells to the company HUBSIDE.STORE, that the latter is not not systematically mentioned in the list of partners likely to approach the persons concerned, and that the latter cannot legitimately expect to receive commercial offers from this company. 70. In defense, the company relies on the contractual commitments of the company \[…\], which provide that the company HUBSIDE.STORE must be mentioned among the recipients of the data collected. It considers that it cannot be held responsible for the shortcomings of its service provider, and produces an example of a form implemented by the company \[…\] containing a URL link to a list of partners, including the company \[…\] \] (a link to the latter's confidentiality policy allowing access to the complete list of companies belonging to the same group as \[…\], including the company HUBSIDE.STORE). Finally, the company claims to implement regular checks relating to the conformity of the files delivered. 71. The restricted training recalls that, if commercial prospecting by non-electronic means can be carried out on the basis of the legitimate interest of the company, the latter must ensure that the processing does not conflict with the rights and interests of the persons whose the data is processed, taking into account their reasonable expectations. 72. In this regard, recital 47 of the GDPR provides that: “\[…\] the existence of a legitimate interest should be the subject of a careful assessment, in particular in order to determine whether a data subject can reasonably expect , at the time and in the context of the collection of personal data, that these are subject to processing for a given purpose The interests and fundamental rights of the person could, in particular, prevail. on the interest of the controller when personal data are processed in circumstances where the data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing \[…\]. 73. In the present case, the restricted panel notes that certain competition forms from which the company \[…\] collects prospect data which it transmits to the company HUBSIDE.STORE do not allow the persons concerned to reasonably expect to receive commercial prospecting offers from this company. 74. Thus, with regard to the form accessible from the website \[…\], the restricted panel observes that the latter contains a hyperlink referring to a nominal list of partners and not to categories of partners. Thus, the persons concerned can legitimately expect that this list of partners is exhaustive. However, said list does not mention the company HUBSIDE.STORE. 75. Concerning the forms present on the sites \[…\] (this form referring to the site www.\[...\]) and \[…\], the restricted training notes that they do not mention the list of partners or categories of partners to which the data may be transmitted, and that they also do not contain any link allowing access to such a list. 76. Moreover, with regard to the checks that the company claims to carry out on the forms from which the data are collected, the restricted training notes that it does not produce any element to attest to this, the contractual commitments of its suppliers do not not constituting a control measure as such. 77. The restricted panel considers that under these conditions, the protection of the interests, freedoms and fundamental rights of the persons concerned takes precedence over the legitimate interests of the company, and that the latter cannot therefore rely on the legal basis mentioned in Article 6, paragraph 1, f) to base its commercial prospecting operations by telephone. 2) On consent 78. The rapporteur considers that, to base its commercial prospecting operations by telephone, the company cannot rely on the legal basis of consent referred to in point a) of Article 6, paragraph 1, of the GDPR. It is based on the same arguments as those developed concerning the breach of article L.34-5 of the GDPR, with regard to the collection forms implemented by data providers. 79. In defense, the company relies on the terms of the contract concluded with the company \[…\]. It takes note of the material findings but indicates that, if the breaches exist, they are representative neither of a desire to ignore its obligations, nor of generalized practices. In this regard, it provides two examples of collection forms implemented by its suppliers, which it considers to be compliant. Finally, it reports checks carried out on the files following their provision by the service provider and emphasizes the impossibility, given the volume of these files, of implementing a unitary check. 80. Firstly, the restricted panel recalls that, if the intentional nature of the violation must be taken into account to decide whether there is reason to impose a fine and to decide on its amount, it has no impact on the characterization of the breach, the latter possibly resulting from negligence. The same applies to the generalized nature or not of said breach. 81. Secondly, with regard to the methods of obtaining consent to telephone prospecting, the restricted panel considers that the forms implemented by the suppliers of the company HUBSIDE.STORE do not make it possible to collect valid consent, in the sense of Article 6, paragraph 1, point a) of the GDPR, as developed in points 47 to 63 of this deliberation with regard to electronic prospecting. 82. Third and last, with regard to the checks that the company claims to carry out on the files delivered, the restricted panel observes that the company does not produce any evidence to attest to this. 83. On the one hand, in its written observations of September 29, 2023, then in its oral observations during the meeting of December 7, 2023, the company mentioned a document entitled ""leads\_701\_23-09-2021 \[…\]"", collected during on-site inspection and reporting, according to it, ""checks of the prospecting files carried out following their provision by the service provider"". By deliberation no. SAN-2023-019 of December 14, 2023, the restricted panel requested the rapporteur and the company to produce this document. 84. The restricted panel notes that the file produced by the rapporteur, the digital fingerprint of which attests that it is indeed the file from which the findings were made by the delegation during the inspection, does not contain any element of a nature to attest to the verifications relied upon by the company. In accordance with what is mentioned on the inspection report, this is a file of prospects (“leads”) delivered by the company \[…\] to the INDEXIA group on September 23, 2021, containing the data of approximately 15,000 prospects. If, for each of these prospects, a URL link allowing access to the source of the data is present, the restricted training notes that no mention is made of verifications which could have been carried out by the company HUBSIDE.STORE or the INDEXIA group. During the meeting of January 18, 2024, the company indicated that it did not question the integrity of this part. 85. Regarding the file produced by the company, the restricted panel notes that it does not correspond to that collected during the inspection, insofar as its digital footprint and its size differ. It further notes that this difference is confirmed by its content since, contrary to the findings appearing in the minutes of September 23, 2021, it does not contain any prospect data but only URL links accompanied by comments (""ok"", ""only one check box"", ""disputed""). 86. Finally, the restricted panel observes that the content of the file produced does not appear consistent with the purpose invoked insofar as the summary and undated comments which appear therein are not linked to any prospect sheet and that it is not Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that the non-conformities identified would have been reported to the company \[…\]. The restricted training thus considers that in any case, such a file does not make it possible to demonstrate the existence of checks carried out on the files delivered. 87. On the other hand, with regard to the other documents in the file, the restricted panel notes that they exclusively attest to requirements imposed by the company HUBSIDE.STORE on the company \[…\], prior to the resumption of their contractual relations , without constituting controls by the company HUBSIDE.STORE on the subsequent practices of its service provider. 88. The restricted panel finally notes that the proportion of non-compliant files among those randomly examined by the delegation (i.e. four non-compliant files out of the seven examined) demonstrates the inadequacy of the measures taken by the company to ensure compliance. validity of the consent of the persons concerned. 89. Thus, the restricted panel considers that the forms referred to in this deliberation do not allow the company HUBSIDE.STORE to have valid consent from the persons concerned. It emphasizes that with regard to the forms produced by the company in its observations of September 29, 2023, the breach noted is persistent. 90. Therefore, in the absence of a legal basis allowing the company HUBSIDE.STORE to base its commercial prospecting operations by telephone, the restricted panel considers that a breach of Article 6 of the GDPR has occurred. E. On the failure to fulfill the obligation of transparency and information of individuals 91. Article 14(1) of the GDPR lists the information to be communicated by the data controller to the data subjects when their personal data has not been collected from them, including the purposes of the processing and its legal basis. 92. Paragraph 2 of this same article provides that ""in addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the data controller shall provide the data subject with ""certain information"" necessary to ensure fair and transparent treatment with regard to the data subject. concerned"", in particular the rights they have, the retention period of the data, the source from which they come or even the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. 93. The rapporteur notes that people who are the subject of commercial prospecting by telephone from the company HUBSIDE.STORE (i.e. approximately 1.3 million French and Belgian prospects between May 2022 and May 2023) are not informed of all of the mandatory information provided for in the aforementioned article 14. It observes that, if prospects are well informed of the recording of the call as well as their possibility of opposing this recording and registering on Bloctel, all other information is not communicated to them, the persons concerned are also not offered the possibility of obtaining more complete information. 94. The company did not present any observations in defense on this point. 95. The restricted training recalls that, to the extent that the company has indicated that it carries out commercial prospecting by telephone based on files transmitted by its partners, this is a case of indirect collection, for which the information of the persons must be insured under the conditions defined in Article 14 of the GDPR. 96. She notes, for clarification, that the EDPS specifies, in his guidelines on transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, that if information at several levels is possible for greater clarity, he "" recommends that the first level (i.e. the main way of first communicating with a data subject) generally communicates the most important information \[...\] For example, when the first contact with a data subject is by telephone , this information could be provided during the telephone call while the other information required under Articles 13 and 14 could be provided subsequently and by other means, including by sending a copy of the privacy policy by email and/or by sending the data subject a link to the online notice/statement of the controller on the protection of privacy at different levels. Regarding the obligation to provide information in a telephone environment, it is suggested to implement ""oral explanations provided by a natural person allowing interaction, \[of\] questions requiring an answer, or \[of\] automated information or pre-recorded offering the option to hear other, more detailed information. 97. The restricted panel observes that it appears from the telephone recordings communicated by the company that the persons subject to telephone prospecting are only informed of the recording of the call and of the possibility of registering on Bloctel, without that no other information is communicated to them regarding the processing of their personal data. 98. The restricted training further notes that these people are not offered any possibility of obtaining more complete information, for example by activating a key on their telephone keypad. 99. Under these conditions, the restricted panel considers that the breach of Article 14 of the GDPR has been established. F. On the failure to comply with the obligation to ensure data security 100. Under the terms of Article 32, paragraph 1 of the GDPR, ""taking into account the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks, the degree of probability and severity of which varies, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee a level of security adapted to the risk \[ …\] ""and in particular ""means to guarantee the constant confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services"" and a ""procedure aimed at regularly testing, analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing"". 101. The rapporteur notes that the company has indicated that it will keep the data of customers of its points of sale in Europe, i.e. 104,391 people in November 2021, for a period of five years from the date of closing of the contract, in accordance with the deadlines legal prescription, specifying that this data was kept in active database, without any intermediate archiving mechanism being implemented. The rapporteur considers that these storage arrangements do not make it possible to limit access to data to users with a need to know, to the extent that people with an interest in having access to this data during the duration of the contract continue, even after the end of the latter, to be able to access it without restriction for a period of five years, even though their functions no longer necessarily require them to know it. 102. In defense, the company indicates that each HUBSIDE.STORE store has its own customer database, and that sellers can therefore only access customer information from the store to which they are attached. Regarding support services, it confirms that they have access to all customer data from the HUBSIDE.STORE network. Furthermore, it does not dispute that at the end of the contractual relationship, no limitation of access occurs, and specifies that certain services, in particular after-sales service, are managed by the sellers themselves. Finally, she underlines, as part of her oral observations during the session of December 7, 2023, that the company HUBSIDE.STORE, although created in 2017, began to deploy its stores from the year 2021, and that no data has therefore been kept for five years. 103. The restricted training recalls that it follows from the provisions of Article 32 of the GDPR that the data controller must put in place appropriate measures to ensure the confidentiality of the data and prevent them from being processed unlawfully by persons who do not need to know (CNIL, FR, October 29, 2021, Sanction, n°SAN-2021-019, published). 104. This need to know is likely to evolve depending on the life cycle of the data and the purposes for which they are kept. Thus, during the phase of their current use, which corresponds to the duration necessary to accomplish the determined purpose, the data are kept on an ""active basis"" and accessible to all the services responsible for implementing the processing. At the end of this phase, when the data is no longer used to achieve the set objective but they still present an administrative interest for the organization (for example for the management of possible litigation) or must be kept to meet a legal obligation, they must be able to be consulted only on an ad hoc and motivated basis by specifically authorized persons, participating in the objective which justified this conservation, by being the subject of intermediate archiving. This intermediate archiving requires a separation from the active database, which can be physical (via a transfer of data within a dedicated archive database), or logical (via the implementation of technical and organizational measures guaranteeing that only people with an interest in processing the data due to their functions can access it). 105. The restricted panel notes that the company does not dispute retaining its customers' data at the end of the contractual relationship, without any intermediate archiving measure taking place. The restricted training recalls that the termination of contractual relations must lead to limiting access to data to certain employees due to their functions. However, the restricted panel considers that as it stands, the elements in the file do not make it possible to establish that people would have access to said data without needing to know it. 106. It follows from the above that the breach of Article 32 of the GDPR is not constituted. III. On the issuance of corrective measures and publicity 107. Under the terms of article 20 of law no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended: ""When the data controller or its subcontractor does not comply with the obligations resulting from regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or this law, the president of the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties may \[...\] refer the matter to the restricted formation of the commission with a view to pronouncing, after adversarial procedure, one or more of the measures following: \[…\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the figure total global annual business of the previous financial year, the highest amount being retained. In the hypotheses mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, these ceilings are increased. , respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of said turnover. The restricted body takes into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same article 83. 108. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that: ""Each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this article for violations of this regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are, in each case, effective , proportionate and dissuasive"", before specifying the elements to be taken into account when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and when deciding the amount of this fine. 109. Firstly, the restricted committee recalls that it must take into account, when issuing an administrative fine, the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, seriousness and duration of the violation. , whether the violation was deliberate or not, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and the categories of personal data affected by the violation . 110. The restricted training emphasizes that the breaches committed by the company relate to obligations relating to the fundamental principles of the protection of personal data. 111. Thus, with regard to the collection of consent for prospecting purposes by electronic means, the restricted training emphasizes the fact that the ecosystem of the resale of data from partners to partners requires particularly strong guarantees as to the quality and to the validity of the consent obtained by the first data collector and which the partners rely on for commercial prospecting purposes. It emphasizes that in this regard, the organization which avails itself of such consent to carry out commercial prospecting operations assumes an essential responsibility requiring it, as data controller, to ensure that the conditions enabling it to carrying out said operations are combined, regardless of the possible liability of the data providers, primary collectors. In addition, it considers that the requirements must be particularly strengthened with regard to the methods of obtaining the consent of users of websites whose purpose is to offer prospects of earning, these people not necessarily being aware of the scope of their agreement as part of their registration. It also notes that the company massively uses electronic prospecting, - this having sent more than 1.3 million SMS messages between September 2020 and September 2021, and more than 220,000 between May 2022 and May 2023 -, and that such practices are likely to be experienced as particularly intrusive. 112. Regarding the failure to comply with the obligation to have a legal basis for processing prospects' data in the context of commercial prospecting by telephone, the restricted training recalls the importance, in the absence of collection of valid consent, to allow data subjects to measure the extent of the processing to which their data is likely to be subject. Thus, the fact that at the time of data collection, a detailed list of partners likely to carry out commercial prospecting operations is made available to the persons concerned, without the company HUBSIDE.STORE appearing there, and without this list is supplemented by a mention specifying the categories of partners to which the company HUBSIDE.STORE could be a part, deprives the persons concerned of the minimum base of information allowing them to preserve their interests, freedoms and fundamental rights. 113. Regarding the failure to comply with the obligation to inform individuals, the restricted panel notes that the company uses data obtained massively from data brokers, without notably allowing the individuals concerned to ascertain the source of their information. collection. It recalls that informing people constitutes a fundamental measure enabling them to exercise the rights from which they benefit, and that such a failure is therefore particularly serious. Finally, she emphasizes that this failure appears structural, to the extent that, of the dozens of call recordings provided by the company, none meets the information requirements provided for in Article 14 of the GDPR. 114. The restricted training finally emphasizes the fact that the company HUBSIDE.STORE, as a subsidiary of the company SFK GROUP, has sufficient human, financial and technical resources to ensure compliance with the rules relating to data protection of a personal nature. 115. In view of all of these elements, the restricted panel considers that it is appropriate to impose an administrative fine for breaches of Articles L. 34-5 of the CPCE and 6 and 14 of the GDPR. 116. Secondly, with regard to the amount of the fine, the restricted committee recalls that the violations noted in this case concern breaches of principles likely to be subject to, under Article 83 of the GDPR , an administrative fine of up to 20 million euros or up to 4% of the global annual turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher. 117. It considers that the activity of the company and its financial situation must in particular be taken into account. It notes in this regard that the company HUBSIDE.STORE achieved a turnover of more than \[…\] euros for the year 2021, for a profit of more than \[…\] euros. Furthermore, the restricted training notes that the number of HUBSIDE.STORE stores increased from 62 in September 2021 to 97 in May 2023, an increase of 56%. 118. Therefore, with regard to the liability of the company, its financial capacities and the relevant criteria of Article 83, paragraph 2, of the GDPR mentioned above, the restricted panel considers that a fine of five hundred and twenty -five thousand euros (€525,000) appears justified. 119. Thirdly, with regard to the publicity of the sanction, the restricted panel considers that this is justified in view of the seriousness of some of the breaches in question, the position of the company on the market, the scope of processing and number of people affected. 120. It also notes that this measure is intended in particular to inform the people concerned by the company's prospecting operations. This information will allow them, if necessary, to assert their rights. 121. Finally, it considers that this measure is proportionate since the decision will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides to: • impose an administrative fine against the company HUBSIDE.STORE in the amount of five hundred and twenty-five thousand euros (€525,000) for breaches of articles L.34-5 of the postal and electronic communications code and 6 and 14 of the GDPR, which breaks down as follows:  two hundred thousand euros (€200,000) for breach of article L.34-5 of the postal and electronic communications code;  three hundred and twenty-five thousand euros (€325,000) for breaches of articles 6 and 14 of the GDPR; • make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer allow the company to be identified by name after a period of two years from its publication. President Philippe-Pierre CABOURDIN This decision may be the subject of an appeal before the Council of State within two months of its notification."

Facts and Procedure 1. The company CEGEDIM LOGICIELS MEDICAUX FRANCE, headquartered at 137 rue d’Aguesseau in Boulogne-Billancourt (92100), is a simplified joint-stock company with a sole shareholder. In 2020 and 2021, it achieved revenues of \[…\] and \[…\] and net results of \[…\] and \[…\]. 2. The sole shareholder of the company CEGEDIM LOGICIELS MEDICAUX FRANCE is the company CEGEDIM SANTÉ (hereinafter referred to as ""the company""), a simplified joint-stock company headquartered at 137 rue d’Aguesseau, 92100 Boulogne-Billancourt. 3. As sole shareholder, the company CEGEDIM SANTÉ decided on the early dissolution without liquidation of the company CEGEDIM LOGICIELS MEDICAUX FRANCE as of November 22, 2021. CEGEDIM SANTÉ took over all activities of CEGEDIM LOGICIELS MEDICAUX FRANCE, as well as the processing of personal data it carried out. 4. The company CEGEDIM SANTÉ is part of the CEGEDIM group, specializing in managing digital flows within the healthcare ecosystem between professionals and designing software for healthcare professionals. In 2022, the revenue of the CEGEDIM group amounted to \[…\] and its net result to \[…\]. 5. The activity of the company CEGEDIM SANTÉ consists in publishing and selling management software to city doctors practicing in offices and health centers. Approximately 25,000 medical offices and 500 health centers use the software offered by the company. Notably, it publishes the CROSSWAY software, which allows doctors to manage their schedules, patient records, and prescriptions. 6. The company offers a panel of city doctors using this software, eligible based on geographic, age, and specialty criteria, to join an observatory to collect data from patient records. If they join the observatory, the data contained in the doctors' software are extracted in the CROSSWAY flow to be used later for studies and statistics in health carried out by the clients of CEGEDIM SANTÉ, including companies \[…\] and \[…\]. For example, CEGEDIM SANTÉ's clients conduct studies on patient management according to their pathologies, demographic, regional disparities, and doctors' management profiles, as well as measuring healthcare consumption. In 2021, about \[…\] doctors had joined this observatory. 7. In return, the panel doctors benefit from a discount on the CROSSWAY software license and the company gives them access to the statistical studies produced by the \[…\] , as well as to personalized dashboards. 8. By Decision No. 2020-085C of May 12, 2020, the President of the National Commission for Informatics and Liberties (hereinafter referred to as ""the Commission"" or ""CNIL"") appointed the Secretary General to carry out or to have carried out a verification mission of the processing carried out by the company CEGEDIM LOGICIEL MEDICAUX FRANCE, its subsidiaries, or on its behalf, at any location that might be concerned by their implementation. 9. On March 30, 2021, a CNIL delegation conducted an inspection at the company's premises to verify compliance with the provisions of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, as amended, relating to Information Technology, Files, and Liberties (hereinafter referred to as ""the Informatics and Liberties Act or the Law of January 6, 1978, as amended"") and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016, on the protection of personal data and the free movement of such data (hereinafter referred to as ""the Regulation or GDPR""). 10. On April 12, 2021, and February 16, 2023, the company provided additional information requested by the delegation during the on-site inspection. 11. To process this information, the President of the Commission appointed Mr. François PELLEGRINI as rapporteur on March 2, 2023, under Article 39 of Decree No. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019, issued for the application of the Informatics and Liberties Act. 12. On October 12, 2023, at the end of his investigation, the rapporteur notified the company of a report detailing the violations of Article 5, paragraph 1, a) of the GDPR and Article 66 of the Informatics and Liberties Act that he considered established in this case. This report proposed that the restricted formation impose an administrative fine on the company and an injunction with a penalty to comply with the identified violations. It also proposed that this decision be made public. 13. On November 17, 2023, the company submitted observations in response to the sanction report. 14. The rapporteur responded to the company's observations on December 8, 2023. 15. On January 8, 2024, the company submitted its second set of observations in response. 16. With Mr. François PELLEGRINI's mandate as commissioner ending on February 1, 2024, the President of CNIL appointed Mr. Claude CASTELLUCCIA as rapporteur on January 31, 2024, pursuant to Article 40 I, paragraph 5 of Decree No. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019. 17. On March 15, 2024, the rapporteur responded to the company's second set of observations. 18. On May 21, 2024, the company provided its third set of observations. 19. By letter dated May 27, 2024, the rapporteur, in accordance with Article 40 III of Decree No. 2019-536 mentioned above, informed the company and the President of the restricted formation that the investigation was closed. 20. By letter dated May 27, 2024, the company was informed that the case was scheduled for the restricted formation meeting on June 13, 2024. 21. On June 12, 2024, the company, through its counsel, requested the postponement of the closure of the investigation until the restricted formation meeting scheduled for the next day, to submit an additional document, namely a copy of a letter addressed by CEGEDIM LOGICIELS MEDICAUX to CNIL on April 25, 2013. The President of the restricted formation granted this request. 22. The rapporteur and the company made oral observations during the restricted formation meeting. II. Grounds for the Decision A. On the grievance alleging the infringement of the rights of defense and the right to a fair trial 23. The company contends that its rights of defense were infringed as the President of the restricted formation, by letter dated December 21, 2023, denied the extension of the deadline for submitting its second set of observations, thus violating its right to a fair trial according to the company. It specifies that to respond to the new arguments advanced by the rapporteur regarding the risk of re-identification analysis, which the company believes requires additional analyses, it had to hire an expert who could only provide conclusions by mid-January 2024, whereas the deadline for responding expired on January 8, 2024. 24. Moreover, the company argues that essential evidence it cited in defense to demonstrate the anonymous nature of the CROSSWAY data flow was not considered by the rapporteur, raising questions about the effective consideration of its arguments and, therefore, the respect of its rights of defense and a fair trial guarantee. 25. Firstly, the restricted formation notes that the deadlines applied in the contradictory procedure are those defined by Article 40 I of Decree No. 2019-536 mentioned above. It notes that the company also received an additional five-day period to submit its initial observations in defense, according to its request made to the President of the restricted formation. 26. Secondly, the restricted formation points out that the sanction report was notified to the company on October 12, 2023. Therefore, nothing prevented it from commissioning an expert since that date because, from the sanction report, the rapporteur considered the data processed by the company to be pseudonymous rather than anonymous. Both the analysis and the rapporteur's position on this point were consistent throughout the sanction procedure and were disclosed as soon as the sanction report was issued. The company could have therefore sought an expert well before receiving the rapporteur’s response to its initial observations in defense. 27. Thirdly, the restricted formation notes that the company was able to submit the expert's relevant conclusions for its defense that it wished to produce since the rapporteur did not close the investigation after the company's second set of observations in defense. Indeed, the rapporteur decided to send a second response to the company's observations, allowing it two months and seven days to submit its third set of observations in response. 28. Finally, if the company believes that the... \[Note: The text cuts off, suggesting the continuation of the decision which may address further points raised by the company or any final determinations by the restricted formation.\] ...rapporteur did not sufficiently take into account the arguments advanced by the company in its various writings and made several errors of judgment, the restricted formation recalls that all the writings and evidence produced by both the company and the rapporteur were indeed brought to its attention, and it thus has the necessary elements to rule on the matter at hand. The restricted formation also notes that the company was able to present its defense observations in its three sets of writings, with several rounds of adversarial exchanges having taken place within the framework of this procedure, as well as orally during the restricted formation session of June 13, 2024. 29. The restricted formation therefore considers that the grievance alleging an infringement of its rights of defense and of the right to a fair trial must be dismissed. B. On the Processing in Question and the Responsibility of the Processing 30. At the time of the inspection conducted by the CNIL and until 2022, the company collected a certain amount of data from panel doctors who had joined its observatory. This data related to both the administrative files of patients (patient numbers, year of birth, sex, socio-professional category, region code, consultation date), medical records (allergies, patient history, family history, height, weight, pulse, blood pressure, diagnoses of the day, etc.), pharmaceutical prescriptions (medication, dosage, duration, etc.), and other prescriptions (sick leave, vaccines, results of biological exams, etc.). 31. All this data is encrypted and linked to a unique identifier for each patient, which does not rely on any personal traits of the patient. The patient data is periodically extracted from the CROSSWAY flow to create a file on the panel doctor's workstation. When generating this file, the patient numbers from the flow are re-encrypted. The file is then transmitted via an encrypted HTTPS channel to the server hosting the database, which aggregates and temporarily stores the data. Thus, even if each patient is assigned different identifiers in the CROSSWAY flow and in the files transmitted by doctors to the company CEGEDIM SANTÉ, all data concerning the same patient from the same doctor is always associated with this second identifier in the dataset communicated to the company CEGEDIM SANTÉ. Conversely, the same patient visiting another medical office will be assigned another unique identifier specific to that other office. The identifier is linked to the medical and administrative data of the same patient, thus enabling the tracking of the patient’s history for a single and the same office. 32. The lines present in the database are composed of the identifiers of the patient and the consulted doctor, as well as various codes. According to the figures provided by the company, the number of lines collected between January 1, 2021, and April 2, 2021, by the company CEGEDIM SANTÉ is more than \[...\]. 33. The data is stored for three months from its reception in the CROSSWAY flow. They are then transmitted to the company's clients, including the company \[...\], which conducts studies and statistics in the health field. Although the data is only stored for three months in the flow, some have more significant historical depth. For example, data from the HRi teleservice, which will be discussed later, is automatically downloaded with a twelve-month depth when the doctor consults it. 34. The company CEGEDIM SANTÉ considers that the data it processes is anonymous and therefore no longer subject to the applicable personal data protection regime. 35. The rapporteur, however, believes that the company has built a warehouse of pseudonymized health data from the data communicated to it by panel doctors to make it available to its clients – some of which belong to the same group – which conduct studies and statistics in the health field. Thus, the rapporteur believes that the company CEGEDIM SANTÉ is required to comply with the regulations relating to the protection of personal data for processing said data and, particularly, to have an authorization to do so. 36. In defense, the company also argues that since 2022, it has implemented new data impoverishment measures at the extraction stage, resulting in less precise data since then. For example, it no longer collects information on patients whose year of birth is 1920 or earlier or if the patient is older than 95 years, it no longer collects the exact number of patient’s children (0 if no children, 1 if 1 child or more, and if the patient is under 18 years old, the number of children is systematically set to 0), and it no longer collects information on patients with an unspecified gender. 37. The restricted formation considers that it is necessary to examine the nature of the processed data and the qualification of the processing before determining the associated responsibilities. 1) On the Nature of the Data Processed in the CROSSWAY Flow a) On the Applicable Legal Framework 38. Article 4, paragraph 1, of the GDPR defines the notion of personal data as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person \[...\]; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier, such as a name, an identification number \[...\]. 39. Article 4, paragraph 15, of the GDPR states that personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveals information about their health status, constitutes health data. 40. Article 4, paragraph 5, of the GDPR defines pseudonymization as the processing of personal data in such a way that they can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. 41. The restricted formation notes that, unlike the notion of pseudonymization, the concept of anonymization is not defined by the GDPR. 42. Recital 26 of the GDPR states that personal data that has undergone pseudonymization and which could be attributed to a natural person through the use of additional information should be considered as information on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, all reasonable means likely to be used either by the data controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly should be taken into consideration, such as the method of targeting. To establish whether means are likely to be used to identify a natural person, all objective factors such as the costs of and the time required for identification, while taking into account the technologies available at the time of processing and technological developments, should be taken into account. Hence, principles relating to data protection should not apply to anonymous information, namely information that does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person, nor to personal data rendered anonymous in such a way that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This regulation does not, therefore, apply to the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes. 43. In its Breyer ruling under Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and Council of October 24, 1995, on the protection of individuals regarding the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data (CJEU, 2nd Chamber, October 19, 2016, C-582/14), the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as “the CJEU”) held that recital 26 of Directive 95/46 states that, to determine whether a person is identifiable, all means likely to be reasonably used either by the data controller or by another person to identify the person should be considered (para. 42) and that, as long as this recital refers to means likely to be reasonably implemented by both the data controller and another person, the wording suggests that, for data to be considered personal data \[...\], it is not required that all the information enabling the identification of the data subject be in the possession of a single person (para. 43). 44. This jurisprudence was confirmed in the OC v European Commission ruling (CJEU, 6th Chamber, March 7, 2024, C-479/22). In this case, the CJEU held that the fact that additional information is needed to identify the data subject does not exclude that the data in question may be considered personal data (para. 49), while taking into account that the possibility of combining the data in question with additional information constitutes a means likely to be reasonably implemented to identify the data subject, by considering all objective factors such as the costs and time required for identification, while taking into account the available technologies at the time of processing and their developments (para. 50). 45. Furthermore, the CJEU specifies in this ruling that it is inherent to the indirect identification of a person that additional information must be combined with the data in question for the purposes of identifying the data subject (para. 55) and that the applicant was not required to prove that they had actually been identified by one of these persons, as such a condition is not provided for in Article 3, point 1, of Regulation 2018/1725, which is limited to requiring that a person be identifiable (para. 61). 46. Lastly, in its ruling IAB Europe v Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit (CJEU, 4th Chamber, March 7, 2024, C-604/22), the Court held that Article 4, point 1, of the GDPR must be interpreted in the sense that a chain composed of a combination of letters and characters, such as the TC String \[Transparency and Consent String\], containing preferences of an Internet or application user regarding the consent of this user to the processing of personal data concerning them by website or application providers as well as by brokers and advertising platforms, constitutes personal data within the meaning of this provision, insofar as it can, by reasonable means, be associated with an identifier, such as the IP address of the said user’s device, allowing the identification of the data subject. It adds that the fact that, without external contributions, a sectoral organization holding this chain cannot access the data processed by its members under the rules it established nor combine the chain with other elements does not prevent the same chain from being personal data under this provision (para. 51). 47. Lastly, for context, the restricted formation notes that in its Opinion 05/2014 on anonymization techniques of April 10, 2014, the Article 29 Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data (hereinafter referred to as “WP29”), now the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter referred to as “EDPB”), indicates that a process can primarily be qualified as anonymization if it withstands three types of risks: - Individualization, which corresponds to the possibility of isolating some or all records identifying an individual within the dataset; - Correlation, which consists of the capacity to link two records concerning the same person in the dataset or between different datasets; - Inference, which corresponds to the possibility of deducing the value of an attribute from the values of a set of attributes in the dataset. Based on an analysis of the nature of the data and the legal framework concerning anonymization and pseudonymization, the restricted formation will now further determine the responsibilities associated with the data processing in question. the same individual within a dataset or across different datasets; - Inference, which involves the ability to deduce the value of an attribute from other attributes within the dataset with a high degree of probability. 48. If data does not resist the above three types of risk, it cannot necessarily be considered pseudonymized. However, data may be deemed anonymous if the data controller can demonstrate that re-identification is not possible through reasonable means, which implies that the risks of re-identification are negligible. 49. The rapporteur asserts, in light of various jurisprudence and doctrine sources, that it is evident the applicable legal framework allows for an assessment of whether processed data is anonymous or pseudonymous. Consistently, tracking individuals over time using a unique identifier can isolate an individual within a dataset, thereby increasing the risk of de-pseudonymization. 50. On the contrary, the company argues that the legal, jurisprudential, and doctrinal framework concerning data anonymization causes legal uncertainty for operators. It highlights the lack of clarity in the framework and the absence of benchmarks, methodologies, or technical prescriptions to demonstrate the anonymity of a dataset. It claims that publications, particularly from the CNIL, the Article 29 Working Party, and the EDPB, fail to ensure compliance with the principle of legal foreseeability stemming from the constitutional requirement of legal security in French law. These publications provide no sufficiently clear technical prescriptions to either ensure operators can reasonably trust their anonymization processes or ensure that proof of anonymization is acceptable to the CNIL. The company presents several arguments to support its stance. 51. Firstly, the company references a decision by a Milan court judge (Milan court, order of December 4, 2023) in a dispute involving the Italian data protection authority, which has a similar activity to CEGEDIM SANTÉ under its observatory. According to the company, the judge concluded that, given the elements at the time, the Italian authority had not demonstrated that the data were not anonymous and that an independent expertise was needed to verify the anonymity of the data, the potential for re-identification, and the concrete risk of such re-identification considering the time and costs involved. 52. Secondly, the company argues that it is justified in relying on a probabilistic acceptance of the notion of personal data. It believes that the analysis of the identification risk should not necessarily strive to reduce this risk to zero, but rather to an acceptable level considering the data's sensitivity, the context, and the processing purposes. It cites a joint document by the Spanish data protection authority and the EDPB published in June 2021, as well as an article co-authored by the rapporteur, Mr. CASTELLUCCIA, in 2020. 53. Thirdly, it contends that the fact that a dataset can be linked to an identifier does not rule out that the data can be considered anonymous, similar to the data in the OpenDamir database of the SNIIRAM. The company posits that if OpenDamir data, which are more detailed in many respects than those processed by CEGEDIM SANTÉ, can be considered anonymous, so should its own data. 54. Ultimately, the company claims that even in the event of identifying a patient code associated with known information about the sought individual in the CROSSWAY flow, this does not necessarily lead to re-identification. It asserts that there is only a certain probability that the information found in the database belongs to the sought individual. Numerous uncertainties can hinder re-identification, such as the possibility that an individual shares known characteristics with others or whether the individual is present in the database. The company supports its point with an extract from a publication by the Directorate of Research, Studies, Evaluation and Statistics (DREES). 55. As a preliminary note, the restricted committee recalls that while the CNIL can publish guidelines, recommendations, or benchmarks to assist in aligning personal data processing with applicable regulations (pursuant to Article 8, paragraph 2(b) of the French Data Protection Act), legal norms are established by French and European legislators and interpreted by competent judicial authorities. Therefore, even if the CNIL has not published specific benchmarks or guidelines on pseudonymization and anonymization, the restricted committee notes that the EDPB has published guidelines that remain relevant. It stresses that both the rapporteur and the company's submissions indicate that these concepts are extensively addressed in jurisprudence and doctrine. Consequently, the absence of CNIL benchmarks, guidelines, or recommendations does not suffice to deem the applicable legal framework unclear. 56. Regarding the Milan court decision, the restricted committee observes that the judge chose to suspend only the enforcement of auxiliary sanctions imposed by the Italian data protection authority related to publication on the company's website and transmission to relevant orders and federations, pending an independent expertise to ascertain whether the data processed by the Italian subsidiary of CEGEDIM SANTÉ are pseudonymized or anonymized. 57. The restricted committee notes that the judge did not suspend the fine and injunction and did not declare the processed data to be anonymous. It further highlights that the Italian data protection authority, in its decision, considered the processed data to be personal data, particularly because a unique identifier is assigned to each patient. 58. Concerning the OpenDamir database mentioned by the company, the restricted committee notes that the two datasets are not comparable. In OpenDamir, each row corresponds to a health insurance reimbursement and not to a patient. A file is issued each month, making it impossible to track an individual patient's medical pathway over time via OpenDamir. Conversely, in the dataset in question, CEGEDIM SANTÉ can identify that multiple files transmitted successively by the same doctor concern the same patient. 59. Moreover, regarding the DREES study cited by the company, the restricted committee notes that it specifies that an accumulation of similarities with a known person could, over subsequent annual releases of the dataset, lead to a probability of identification close to certainty. This corresponds to how CEGEDIM SANTÉ’s processing is structured, as it can trace the exact care pathway of a patient from the same doctor over time and possesses a large volume of data. The same DREES study clearly states that replacing an individual's initial identifier with another arbitrary identifier constitutes pseudonymization, not anonymization. Therefore, the restricted committee considers the use of this DREES study by the company to be irrelevant in this case. 60. Finally, the restricted committee notes that there is no dispute, either in jurisprudence or doctrine, that assigning a unique code or identifier to individuals for tracking purposes enables their individualization within a dataset. Additionally, it is well established that to assess the risk of de-pseudonymization, the potential to combine the primary dataset with other data, which may be held by third parties, must be considered. Such other data may include, for instance, geolocation data. b) On the Nature of Processed Data 61. Concerning patient data, the rapporteur notes that the dossier documents reveal that each patient is assigned a unique identifier for the same doctor within the CROSSWAY flow. This identifier, which does not rely on any personal trait, is linked to the medical and administrative data of the same patient, enabling tracking of the patient’s historical data for the same doctor. Consequently, the rapporteur considers that, with the patient identifier provided, CEGEDIM SANTÉ can identify that multiple files transmitted successively by the same doctor pertain to the same patient within its observatory. 62. The rapporteur concludes that: - Firstly, the process of replacing directly identifying data with indirectly identifying data, i.e., a unique identifier for the same doctor’s patient, perfectly aligns with the definition of pseudonymization, facilitating longitudinal patient tracking. - Secondly, because an individual can thus be isolated in the dataset and data concerning that individual can accumulate over time, the patient data is sufficiently detailed to allow de-pseudonymization through reasonable means. 63. During adversarial exchanges with the company, the rapporteur produced evidence to support his analysis, demonstrating the ability to accurately trace the care pathway of a 12-year-old child with a long-term disease (ALD) using only a few lines of data provided by the company during the control process. 64. Regarding doctors’ data, the rapporteur notes that the company generates a panel number from a doctor’s client number, and this panel number appears in the files generated by panel doctors and transmitted to CEGEDIM SANTÉ. Moreover, the company holds a correspondence table between the panel number and the doctor’s identity. This possession of such a table makes the data even more precise. Hence, the rapporteur considers the company can identify that the same doctor repeatedly provides files and that these are pseudonymized data. 65. In its defense, the company claims the data is anonymous. It argues that the rapporteur's demonstration is theoretical and entirely focused on the possibilities of individualization from the CROSSWAY flow data, without evaluating real and residual re-identification risks under practical means reasonably used by the company, including specific contextual elements. 66. The company contends that identifying a person, allowing data to be considered personal data, cannot be affirmed by hypothesis but must be validated by an in concreto analysis of the reasonable means of identification. According to the Breyer and OC v European Commission decisions, these reasonable means must be legal and practically mobilizable, considering objective factors like identification costs and time, and the technologies available at the time of processing. Furthermore, beyond analyzing precise contextual elements and quantifying the likelihood of their occurrence against objective factors (time, cost, workforce, available technologies), the motivations of individuals who could perform identification must also be considered. the company argues that the hypothetical identification approach without such practical assessment does not align with the requirements laid out in legal precedents and is insufficient to prove the risk of re-identification. 67. To support its claims, the company provides an external evaluation conducted by the firm \[…\], commissioned by \[…\], concerning the data in the \[…\] database fed by the CROSSWAY stream. This evaluation concludes that the data is anonymous. 68. Lastly, regarding the correspondence table held by the company, it argues that the table listing the codes and identities of the physicians participating in the observatory cannot reasonably be used to assist in re-identifying patients. The company asserts that this table is managed by a dedicated team separate from the one operating the CROSSWAY stream, on an isolated workstation, with complete separation of information and perfect role and responsibility segregation between the two teams. 69. Firstly, the restricted committee notes that the pseudonymous or anonymous nature of the data is of considerable importance for the concerned individuals. If data is not deemed personal data, data protection regulations do not apply, thus permitting unrestricted usage. Specifically, an anonymous database is exempted from the security obligations stipulated by Article 32 of the GDPR and can be freely disclosed or published. The entity operating such a database has no obligation to inform. 70. In this case, regarding patient data, the restricted committee notes that CEGEDIM SANTÉ, from the time of the CNIL's inspection until 2022, collected a significant amount of data from panel physicians, covering patients' administrative records, medical records, pharmaceutical prescriptions, and other prescriptions. The restricted committee notes that since 2022, the company has stopped collecting information related to socio-professional category, family situation, and number of children, removed the regional code, and reduced the granularity of height and weight measurements. 71. The restricted committee notes that even though each patient is assigned different identifiers in the CROSSWAY stream and the files transmitted by physicians to CEGEDIM SANTÉ, all data related to the same patient from the same physician remains associated with the latter identifier within the dataset communicated to CEGEDIM SANTÉ. Consequently, using the patient identifier provided, CEGEDIM SANTÉ can link several files transmitted successively by the same physician for the same patient, which the company does not contest, thus tracking the patient's care with this physician. 72. As a result, the restricted committee notes that it is possible to isolate an individual within the dataset since the unique identifier allows for tracking patients over time. Consequently, the processing does not withstand the risk of individualization as described in the Opinion 05/2014 on anonymization techniques of April 10, 2014. 73. Regarding physicians' data, the restricted committee notes that CEGEDIM SANTÉ can identify from the panel's physicians, thanks to the physician identifier, which physician is repeatedly communicating files. 74. Secondly, the restricted committee observes that the data collected is particularly extensive and the data's depth significant: on one hand, because the company processes numerous data points; on the other hand, because although the company retains data for only three months in its database, it retrieves twelve-month-depth data via the HRi teleservice, containing health reimbursement history information by health insurance. This extensive dataset allows the company to trace patient care pathways over the past twelve months, substantially increasing the risk of de-pseudonymization. 75. Given the failure to meet the three criteria established in the Opinion 05/2014 on anonymization techniques, the restricted committee concludes that the risk of re-identification must be evaluated concretely to establish the data's anonymous or pseudonymous nature. 76. In support of this approach, the restricted committee notes that the rapporteur, in his writings, managed to trace a 12-year-old child's care pathway suffering from a long-term ailment from a reduced dataset transmitted by the company. The rapporteur achieved this quickly and with minimal resources, using only Excel software and the provided nomenclature to link alphanumeric codes to patient information and medical acts. The rapporteur did not resort to third-party data sources, such as data brokers or geolocation data. 77. The restricted committee further notes that correlating third-party data with the information held by CEGEDIM SANTÉ (notably patient data and consultation information) would considerably increase the possibilities of de-pseudonymization. Despite the company's assertion of not holding geographic data, the restricted committee recalls that a regional code was collected until 2022, and the company maintains a correspondence table between panel numbers and physicians’ identities. 78. The company also contests using third-party data to evaluate the anonymity of a dataset. The restricted committee reminds that the CJUE has ruled that for data to be categorized as personal, it is not necessary for the data to independently identify the individual. Furthermore, the necessity of additional external information does not exclude data from being considered personal (OC v European Commission, §§ 47 and 55, and IAB Europe v Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit, § 51). 79. The restricted committee highlights that if the rapporteur isolated an individual and tracked part of their care pathway in detail from only a dataset extract, without additional information, then it is possible to de-pseudonymize individuals using reasonable means. The restricted committee notes the richness of data held by the company, having received over \[…\] lines between January 1, 2021, and April 2, 2021 (each line representing an event, such as a consultation), \[…\] patient codes from January to March 2021, and \[…\] prescriber codes in April 2021. 80. Despite the rapporteur not personally de-pseudonymizing the child's care pathway, the restricted committee reminds that identification is not necessary for data to be categorized as personal. The CJUE ruled in OC v European Commission that proving effective identification is unnecessary, as Article 3, point 1, of Regulation 2018/1725 only requires identifiability (§ 61). The restricted committee considers a similar reasoning applies to the GDPR, as the definition in Article 4, paragraph 1, is identical. 81. Thirdly, when the three criteria set by the G29 opinion are unfulfilled, the company must analyze and demonstrate negligible re-identification risks. The company did not perform such an analysis for the CNIL's control period, only conducting it in October 2023, applying it to post-2022 data processing. Furthermore, to assess re-identification risks, the company only combined a limited number of data points from its vast dataset, rendering the assessment unreliable (in this case, combining the patient's birth year, gender, and parenthood status, ignoring other data like approximate weight and height, consultation history, prescriptions, duration, medical history, physiological constants, and diagnosed pathologies). 82. The restricted committee notes that the conclusions of the evaluation conducted by \[…\] during the adversarial process do not undermine this assessment. The evaluation focused on post-implementation processing, which included new measures such as reducing data depth, and did not assess the data's anonymity at the control's time. 83. The restricted committee also notes that \[…\]'s expertise does not integrate all factors representing data richness from long-term tracking of the same individuals. 84. Lastly, the restricted committee notes that the expertise of \[…\] concurs with the rapporteur's conclusion on the possibility of isolating an individual within the dataset held by CEGEDIM SANTÉ, confirming k-anonymity equals 1. K-anonymity is a confidentiality measurement model ensuring each identifier in a dataset corresponds to an equivalence class containing at least K records. The restricted committee notes that although expertise \[…\] did not conclude the re-identification of individuals, it acknowledged the possibility of isolating an individual in the dataset, aligning with the first risk type identified by the G29 in its Opinion 05/2014 on anonymization techniques. 85. The second phase of expertise involves risk analysis to determine the plausibility of making data held by the company accessible to others, capable of linking these data to patients' actual identities, for instance, in the event of a data breach. The restricted committee notes the high security level highlighted by the company but concludes that the analysis focused on data access risk and breach probability. The security level ensures data confidentiality. The security level, however high it may be, does not impact the qualification of the processed data. 86. It results from all the above that on the day of the inspection and until 2022, the directly identifying data was replaced by indirectly identifying data, namely a unique identifier for the concerned patient, allowing the processing of their data without being able to identify them directly. Nevertheless, the pseudonymity could be lifted due to the richness of the information. 87. Consequently, the restricted committee considers that the data processed by CEGEDIM SANTÉ until 2022 is pseudonymous and not anonymous. 88. The restricted committee takes note of the additional measures implemented by the company since 2022, notably that it no longer collects certain data and, for others, it no longer collects the same level of granularity. The company believes that as modified, its processing is anonymous. However, the restricted committee believes that the analysis of the new state of the processing was not the initial object of the procedure and is not in a position to pronounce on this point within the framework of this decision. It invites the company, if it wishes, to request advice from the CNIL to determine the anonymous nature or not of the database in its new state. 2) On the qualification of the processing as a health data warehouse 89. The company argues that the processing it implements is not a health data warehouse but a network of doctors who agree to transmit anonymous data from their medical records to CEGEDIM SANTÉ partners, namely \[…\] and \[…\]. It particularly believes that the transitory nature of the flow, in which data is only kept for three months, demonstrates that it is not a permanent database like a warehouse. 90. The restricted committee recalls that the notion of a health data warehouse is not in the Law on Information Technology and Liberties but constitutes a doctrinal construction of the CNIL for the application of articles 65 et seq. of this law. It is evaluated using a combination of criteria, taking into account, but not limited to, the duration of data retention. Among the determining elements of a health data warehouse qualification are the reuse of data in subsequent processing, the continuous feeding of the database, and the purposes of the processing. 91. In this case, the restricted committee notes from the records that CEGEDIM SANTÉ: - Massively collects health data from patients and doctors (more than \[…\] lines received in the database between January 1, 2021, and April 2, 2021 - a line corresponding to an event, for example, a consultation; \[…\] patient codes held from January to March 2021; \[…\] prescriber codes held in April 2021); - Continuously feeds its database to achieve a significant volume of data (daily data upload from doctors' workstations); - Makes the data available to its clients who conduct health studies and statistics. Among these clients is \[…\] company. 92. The restricted committee notes substantial changes to the processing effective June 1, 2024. Specifically, data upload from doctors' workstations to \[…\] company is no longer operated through CEGEDIM SANTÉ. Since the end of July 2024, CEGEDIM SANTÉ no longer manages the CROSSWAY stream data from doctors’ software, with doctors now directly feeding the \[…\] database held by \[…\] company. 93. Given the above, the restricted committee believes that the company maintained a health data warehouse until the CNIL control and until the effective reorganization on June 1, 2024, which stopped data transit through CEGEDIM SANTÉ. 3) On the company's status in terms of data controller responsibility 94. According to Article 4 of the GDPR, the data controller is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing (point 7), and a processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller (point 8). 95. As guidance, in its guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR, adopted on July 7, 2021, the EDPB explains the definition of the controller as follows: Determining the purposes and means involves deciding respectively the ""why"" and the ""how"" of the processing: for a specific processing operation, the controller is the entity that has determined the reason why the processing takes place (i.e., ""for what purpose"" or ""why"") and how that aim shall be attained (i.e., which means shall be employed to achieve the aim). A natural or legal person exercising this influence on the processing of personal data thus participates in determining the purposes and means of the processing in question, in accordance with the definition in Article 4, paragraph 7, of the GDPR. The controller must decide both the purposes and the means of processing \[…\]. (§§ 35 and 36). 96. Regarding processing, the guidelines specify that Article 4, paragraph 8, of the GDPR defines a processor as a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller and that For an entity to be considered a processor, two basic conditions must be met: a) it must be a separate entity from the controller and b) process personal data on behalf of the controller (§§ 73 and 76). 97. The rapporteur considers that CEGEDIM SANTÉ defines the purposes and means of the processing in question and constitutes a health data warehouse for its own activity needs, subsequently making the data available to its clients who reuse them for health studies and statistics. 98. In defense, the company states it acts as a processor for the doctors using the CROSSWAY software and for \[…\] and \[…\] companies for which it operates the CROSSWAY flow. It argues that the purposes and means determination claimed by the rapporteur only applies to the management and recruitment of a panel of doctors by CEGEDIM SANTÉ, and not to obtaining patient data. Thus, it claims not to pursue its own purposes for the data derived from this flow and limits its role to a technical intermediary facilitating data upload from doctors' workstations to partner companies. 99. The company supports its statements with a closure letter from a 2014 control of CEGEDIM LOGICIELS MEDICAUX FRANCE (dissolved in 2021 and whose entire activity was taken over by CEGEDIM SANTÉ), in which the CNIL ostensibly recognized the company's processor status. It asserts that this letter remains applicable as the factual and legal circumstances regarding party qualification have not changed, and that the letter represents a validly adopted act by an authorized person to represent and commit the CNIL, namely the Commission’s President. Additionally, it contends that the letter's age is irrelevant because the understanding of anonymity has not substantially changed with the GDPR or the Law on Information Technology and Liberties. 100. Firstly, the restricted committee notes that in its impact assessment, the company designated itself as the data controller for its observatory and not merely for recruiting a doctor panel. Furthermore, the records indicate that CEGEDIM SANTÉ manages data collection contracts with eligible doctors wishing to join its epidemiological observatory and defines data transmission modalities to its partners \[…\] and \[…\]. 101. Regarding processing purposes, the restricted committee notes that the company determines the scope and purposes of data use from its observatory vis-à-vis its partners. Specifically, the contract with \[…\] company stipulates that the authorized data use is: conducting health-related analyses or studies directly or through an intermediary, and the addendum to the contract with \[…\] company specifies that it will use the data on medical prescriptions transmitted by CLM \[CEGEDIM SANTÉ\] solely for performing studies. The study results will only be commercialized in the form of statistics. Any other form of data commercialization is prohibited (free translation). Moreover, the company defines the participant scope for the observatory by offering CROSSWAY software use to a representative panel of outpatient doctors, eligible based on geographic, age, and specialty criteria. 102. Regarding processing means, the restricted committee notes that the contracts between the company and the panel doctors do more than merely recruit doctors; they detail processing methods, including data collection and transmission modalities. For instance, the contracts impose participation conditions on doctors, such as the categories of collected data, data communication methods, and collection frequency. 103. The restricted committee believes that the records show CEGEDIM SANTÉ determines the processing purposes and means, organizes the processing for its own needs to implement its observatory, and does not receive execution directives. 104. The restricted committee clarifies that the data transmission to third-party partners who will reuse the data for their purposes does not obstruct CEGEDIM SANTÉ's qualification as a data controller. In chain processing, each company acts as a data controller, determining the means for the processing they conduct for their purposes. 105. Secondly, the restricted committee assesses that the processing should be evaluated considering observations from the March 30, 2021, control mission and the current doctrine and state-of-the-art perspectives. The restricted committee does not feel bound by the observations from the 2012 control mission. 106. The restricted committee notes that substantial developments in personal data protection have occurred since the closure letter addressed to CEGEDIM LOGICIELS MEDICAUX FRANCE in 2014, following verification missions conducted in 2001 and March 2012. This letter predates the GDPR, the reference text for personal data protection. Doctrine developments particularly reflect in the terminology used, as the letter mentioned patient anonymity, at a time when anonymity referred to the absence of directly identifying data, not the impossibility of identifying a person from a data set. 107. The restricted committee further notes that the letter does not indicate that the CNIL considered, based on its verification missions in 2002 and then in 2014, that it was a case of anonymized data processing falling outside the scope of the Informatique et Libertés law. If this had been the case, the letter would not have listed several recommendations to ensure the security of the data processed. The letter notably invited the company to implement an automatic purge mechanism for files on doctors' workstations and to designate a data protection officer. 108. In any case, the restricted committee recalls that it is incumbent on the controller to take into account doctrinal developments and regularly reassess the technical and organizational measures of the implemented processing. 109. In conclusion, the restricted committee does not challenge the validity of the 2014 letter but, considering its age and the developments in the legal and jurisprudential framework, it does not feel bound by this old position, which is itself based on a CNIL deliberation over twenty years old and relevant findings. The restricted committee considers that this letter alone cannot demonstrate the status of the company CEGEDIM SANTÉ as a processor. 110. In view of all the above, the restricted committee considers that the company CEGEDIM SANTÉ is a data controller within the meaning of Article 4, point 7, of the GDPR. Therefore, by implementing the concerned processing, the company, if it collects and processes personal data as a controller, must comply with the regulations regarding the protection of personal data. C. On the breach of Article 66 of the Informatique et Libertés law 111. Article 65 of the Informatique et Libertés law provides that processing containing data regarding people’s health is subject to Section 3: Processing of personal data in the health sector of Chapter III: Obligations of controllers and processors, except for various categories of processing listed in paragraphs 1 to 6 of this article. 112. Article 66 of the Informatique et Libertés law states: I - The processing falling under this section can only be implemented in consideration of the public interest purpose they represent. Ensuring high standards of quality and safety of healthcare and medicines or medical devices constitutes a public interest purpose. II - Frameworks and standard regulations, as described in b and c of 2° of I of Article 8, applicable to processing falling under this section are established by the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés, in consultation with the health data platform mentioned in Article L. 1462-1 of the public health code and representative public and private bodies of the concerned stakeholders. Processing that complies with these frameworks can be implemented provided their controllers send a prior declaration to the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés attesting to this compliance. \[…\] III - The processing mentioned in I that does not comply with a framework mentioned in II can only be implemented after authorization by the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés. The authorization request is presented in the forms provided in Article 33. \[…\] 113. Thus, under III of Article 66 of the Informatique et Libertés law, personal data processing in the health sector, including health data warehouses, can only be implemented after CNIL authorization or if they comply with a framework mentioned in II of this article, considering the public interest they represent. 114. The rapporteur considers that the company collects pseudonymized data from computerized patient records, transmitted by panel doctors via the CROSSWAY flow, to constitute this health data warehouse. In the absence of obtaining the consent of the concerned individuals for the inclusion of their data in a health data warehouse (applying Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR), such a warehouse's creation is subject to prior formalities with the CNIL. However, the rapporteur recalls that the company CEGEDIM SANTÉ has neither obtained the explicit consent of the concerned individuals for the collection, recording, and storage of the health data included in the warehouse nor submitted any authorization request concerning the processing to the CNIL, nor sent any declaration attesting to the processing's compliance with a framework within the meaning of II of Article 66 of the Informatique et Libertés law. The rapporteur concludes that the company failed to comply with the obligations provided in Article 66 of the Informatique et Libertés law in the health sector. 115. In defense, the company argues that it does not breach Article 66 of the Informatique et Libertés law as it does not process personal data, including pseudonymized or health data. It asserts that the CROSSWAY flow only contains anonymous data and, therefore, does not constitute a health data warehouse and is not subject to the formalities provided by Article 66 of the Informatique et Libertés law to process such data. 116. Furthermore, the company asserts it cannot be reproached for failing to comply with its obligations due to the lack of clarity in the legal framework, particularly in defining the notion of anonymization. The company argues it cannot be faulted for not seeking the CNIL’s advice since the CNIL has never indicated the possibility for organizations to seek validation of the anonymization methods they use, and in any case, it has in good faith considered that the data it processes were anonymous. 117. Initially, the restricted committee notes that the CNIL has published certain resources on its website before the control, for instance, on defining health data (early 2018), the formalities to be carried out for health data processing (early 2018), or the distinction between a health data warehouse and research (late 2019). In addition to its resources, the CNIL also relays other information sources as it did with the Opinion 05/2014 on anonymization techniques of WP29. The restricted committee also recalls that the legal framework is primarily set by the French and European legislators. 118. Therefore, the restricted committee considers that the company could not have been unaware of the legal regime applicable to its health data warehouse at the time of the control, especially considering other companies conducting similar processing in the same market have requested authorizations from the CNIL, and these authorizations are public and accessible on the website www.legifrance.gouv.fr. If the company considers that these authorizations are not comparable to the database it constitutes, particularly regarding the richness of the data collected by these companies, the restricted committee recalls that any organization constituting a health data warehouse must comply with its obligations, including Article 66 of the Informatique et Libertés law, regardless of the warehouse's richness and the granularity of the collected data. 119. The restricted committee recalls that, for the reasons exposed above, the company CEGEDIM SANTÉ processed pseudonymized health data during the control to constitute a health data warehouse, and thus it was bound to comply with the GDPR and the Informatique et Libertés law. 120. Firstly, the restricted committee notes that the only exception to the obligations of Article 65 of the said law applicable in this case is the one regarding the explicit consent of the concerned individual for the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes, in accordance with Article 65 1°, referring to Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR. However, in this case, since CEGEDIM SANTÉ considers it does not process personal data, it has not implemented any measures to comply with the applicable rules for processing them. Specifically, the company has not implemented any mechanism for obtaining the explicit and prior consent of the patients from panel doctors for the concerned processing. 121. Consequently, the restricted committee considers that since the company processed health data during the control and cannot rely on any of the exceptions provided in Article 65 of the Informatique et Libertés law, the processing it implements falls under Section 3 of Chapter III of said law. 122. Secondly, the restricted committee notes that, in this case, the company has not complied with the requirements of Article 66 of the Informatique et Libertés law to constitute a health data warehouse. 123. Firstly, it notes that the company has not submitted any authorization request for the concerned processing to be considered necessary for reasons of public interest in the field of public health or necessary for scientific research purposes. 124. Secondly, the restricted committee recalls that in the absence of CNIL authorization, personal data processing in the health sector can also be implemented if it complies with a framework within the meaning of II of Article 66 of the Informatique et Libertés law, provided the controller submits a prior declaration to the CNIL attesting to this compliance. The restricted committee notes that this is not the case here and that the company has not sent the CNIL any declaration attesting to this compliance. 125. Thirdly, the restricted committee takes note of the new measures implemented post-control. 126. On one hand, the company indicated that it no longer collects certain data since 2022. However, as developed above, the restricted committee considers that the elements communicated by the company during the procedure do not allow it to ensure that it now processes anonymous data. It also notes, in any case, that the measures deployed in 2022 cannot absolve the company of its past responsibilities. 127. On the other hand, the company indicated that starting at the end of July 2024, it would no longer participate in the management of the CROSSWAY flow, which now directly feeds the base \[…\] held by the company \[…\]. Thus, CROSSWAY flow data no longer transits through CEGEDIM SANTÉ. 128. In view of all the above, the restricted committee considers that the company processed health data during the control and until July 2024 and should have complied with the requirements of Article 66 of the amended Law of January 6, 1978, to constitute a health data warehouse. 129. Therefore, the restricted committee considers that the company has failed to meet its obligations by processing personal data in the health sector in violation of Article 66 of the amended Law of January 6, 1978. 130. Given the measures taken by the company during the procedure, the restricted committee considers that there is no need to impose any sanctions. D. On the Breach of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR 131. Under Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR, personal data must be: a) processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently in relation to the data subject (lawfulness, fairness, transparency). 132. Article L. 162-4-3 of the Social Security Code provides that physicians may, during the medical care they provide and under the conditions referred to in Article L. 161-31, consult data derived from reimbursement or coverage procedures held by the organization to which each insured person belongs. In such cases, they must inform the patient beforehand. The care recipient consents to this access by allowing the physician to use, for this purpose, the electronic identification means referred to in Article L. 161-31. The data report made available to the physician contains the necessary information to identify the acts, products, or services covered for care provided in outpatient or health facilities, particularly with reference to the lists mentioned in Articles L. 162-1-7, L. 165-1, and L. 162-17. It also includes the code provided to identify them in these lists, the coverage level, and, for patients with long-term illnesses, the elements constituting the care protocol mentioned in the seventh paragraph of Article L. 324-1. 133. Article R. 162-1-10 of the same code states: ""For the application of Article L. 162-4-3, the managers of the basic health insurance schemes ensure, for the use of contracted doctors or doctors practicing in a facility or health center, during the medical care they provide, the implementation of an electronic information consultation service regarding the benefits provided to their beneficiaries."" 134. For implementing these provisions, the health insurance scheme has notably established two teleservices: - The HRi teleservice: information related to the health reimbursement history by the health insurance scheme for a patient over the last twelve months; - The ALDi teleservice: data related to long-term illnesses (ALD) recognized by the health insurance scheme for a patient (including the consultation date, ALD code, start and end dates of the ALD, and information on whether the ALD is covered). 135. In this case, the supervisory delegation found that among the data transmitted by the CROSSWAY flow to CEGEDIM SANTÉ are data derived from these two teleservices. 136. The delegation was also informed that the information transmitted to CEGEDIM SANTÉ via the CROSSWAY flow could originate from teleservice queries or be directly entered by doctors. 137. The rapporteur contends that the Social Security Code and the Public Health Code provisions only provide a right to consult the data contained in the teleservices set up by the National Health Insurance Fund for authorized professionals. They do not foresee the possibility for a private entity, via the physician, to directly collect these data from the teleservices. Thus, the rapporteur believes that the collection of these data by CEGEDIM SANTÉ is illegal and conducted in violation of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR. 1) On Data from the ALDi Teleservice 138. The restricted committee reiterates that the provisions of the Social Security Code govern only the methods of direct access to personal data from the ALDi teleservice but do not prescribe access to these same data from doctors' computerized records. The CNIL has previously authorized pseudonymized extractions of patient records to build health databases, without excluding as a principle the import of data originally from health insurance databases, provided the processing is proportional and adequately secure, and that the other rules on the processing of personal data are respected. Under these conditions, the restricted committee believes, as argued by the company, that it is permitted to receive ALDi teleservice data in the CROSSWAY flow as long as they are integrated into the computerized patient record by the physician, just like other data recorded therein. 139. However, the case file indicates that the CROSSWAY extractor only allows data extraction from patients' computerized records and does not connect to the teleservice or directly extract data from it. Specifically, the company asserts that the physician may first consult the data from the ALDi teleservice without downloading them and later decide to download these data and add them to the computerized patient record in the CROSSWAY software. 140. The restricted committee takes into account the evidence provided by the company and concludes that the breach of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR is not established concerning the collection of data from the ALDi teleservice. 2) On Data from the HRi Teleservice 141. Regarding data from the HRi teleservice, the company argues that the Social Security Code's provisions do not prescribe or prohibit access to doctors' computerized records containing data from the HRi teleservice, especially when such access concerns only anonymous data. Thus, the company believes it is authorized to receive these data in the CROSSWAY flow, just like other data in patient records. 142. More specifically, the company asserts that HRi teleservice data are recorded in the CROSSWAY flow locally by the physician during the teleservice consultation and that only later are the data retrieved by the CROSSWAY extractor. It concludes that the CROSSWAY extractor does not directly extract these data, and thus the collection cannot be considered illegal. However, the company has indicated it is willing, as an alternative and if the restricted committee adopts the rapporteur's position, to modify the CROSSWAY software to make HRi data download an optional feature activatable by doctors. 143. In any case, the company emphasizes its transparency and good faith, asserting that the CNIL was aware of the data retrieval methods for reimbursement history data by CEGEDIM LOGICIELS MEDICAUX, then CEGEDIM SANTÉ. It supports its defense with a letter dated April 25, 2013, in which CEGEDIM LOGICIELS MEDICAUX informed the CNIL about integrating a feature in doctors' software to retain data from reimbursement histories. 144. Finally, the company emphasizes that access to HRi teleservice data by healthcare professionals is recommended by the GIE SESAME-Vitale and, more broadly, that this functionality of data access by physicians serves a public health and drug iatrogeny prevention purpose, allowing them to access information on medications, care, and tests prescribed to their patients by other physicians. 145. The rapporteur emphasizes that the concern is not about doctors accessing HRi teleservice data and adding them to the computerized patient record but the fact that once accessed, CEGEDIM SANTÉ automatically receives the data without the doctor needing to decide whether these data should be included in the patient's record within their working software. 146. The restricted committee notes that, unlike the ALDi teleservice data, HRi teleservice data consultation by the doctor automatically triggers their download, up to twelve months, into the patient's computerized record in the CROSSWAY software. 147. By not providing an intermediate step allowing doctors to consult the data without it automatically triggering the download into the patient record, the restricted committee considers CEGEDIM SANTÉ performs an automatic data extraction from the HRi teleservice into the CROSSWAY flow, as soon as the doctor connects to the software to consult the data, without any additional action on their part. 148. The restricted committee further considers that the practicality criterion invoked in defense by the company, where doctors can directly access information on medications, care, and tests prescribed to their patients by other physicians to detect possible incompatibilities, does not justify the use of patient data in a manner that contravenes the regulations. 149. The restricted committee also states that the issue is not about doctors' access to HRi teleservice data or their addition to the computerized patient record, but the fact that the extractor does not allow for consulting the data without automatically downloading it into the patient record and thus, de facto, without CEGEDIM SANTÉ extracting these data via the CROSSWAY extractor. The restricted committee considers this data collection occurs in violation of Articles L. 162-4-3 and R. 162-1-10 of the Social Security Code and Article R. 1111-8-6 of the Public Health Code, which do not allow a private entity to collect data directly through the sole consultation by a doctor of the HRi teleservice. 150. Finally, regarding the April 25, 2013 letter provided by the company, the restricted committee notes that it does not detail the consultation, downloading into the patient record, and data transmission methods of the reimbursement history to CEGEDIM LOGICIELS MEDICAUX. It reminds that the issue is not doctors' access to the data but the methods of their transmission to the company. Therefore, the content of this letter does not impact the characterization of the breach. 151. In view of the above, the restricted committee considers that the breach of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR is established regarding the collection of data from the HRi teleservice. III. On the Pronouncement of Corrective Measures and Publicity 152. Article 20, paragraph IV, of the Informatique et Libertés law states: ""When the controller or its processor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, or this law, the president of the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés may, if necessary after issuing the warning provided in I of this article or after pronouncing one or more of the corrective measures provided in III, bring the matter before the restricted committee for the issuance, following an adversarial procedure, of one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 2° An order to bring the processing into conformity with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, or this law or to comply with requests submitted by the data subject to exercise their rights, which may be accompanied, except when the processing is implemented by the State, by a penalty of up to €100,000 per day of delay from the date set by the restricted committee; \[…\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State..."" ""... a penalty of up to €10 million or, in the case of an undertaking, 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, may be imposed. In the cases referred to in points 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, these caps are respectively increased to €20 million and 4% of said turnover. The restricted committee considers the criteria outlined in the same Article 83 when determining the amount of the fine. A. On the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount 154. The company argues that in good faith it believed it was not processing personal data. It notes that punitive action was initiated against it more than two years after the checks, without the CNIL having previously notified it of its differing position on the nature of the data processed, thereby not providing the opportunity to complete the required formalities. The company also claims that the CNIL was aware of the processing carried out by the company since the checks on CEGEDIM LOGICIELS MEDICAUX in 2002 and 2012, without requesting the company to submit an authorization application. Finally, the company indicates that, given its status as a processor, it should not be held responsible for the alleged breaches, as the provisions of Article 66 of the Informatique et Libertés law and Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR set out obligations applicable only to data controllers. 155. Regarding the amount of the fine proposed by the rapporteur, the company considers it disproportionate and argues that it has not been demonstrated how the share of CEGEDIM SANTÉ’s turnover related to the observatory’s activity was accounted for in determining this amount. 156. Firstly, the restricted committee notes that the breaches of the provisions of Article 66 of the Informatique et Libertés law and Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR are attributable to it in its capacity as the data controller in question. 157. Secondly, in assessing the merit of imposing a fine, the restricted committee underscores the application of the criterion in point a) of Article 83(2) of the GDPR regarding the severity of the breach, considering the nature, scope of the processing, and the number of individuals concerned. 158. The restricted committee deems the breaches identified as severe. Both the GDPR and the Informatique et Libertés law establish a principle prohibiting the processing of specific categories of data, including health data. The regime provided by Section 3 (Processing of personal data in the field of health) of Chapter III (Obligations of the data controller and the processor) of the Informatique et Libertés law constitutes an exception to this prohibition principle and must be interpreted strictly. Adhering strictly to the provisions of this section by data controllers who wish to process health data is essential to safeguard the fundamental rights of the individuals concerned. However, in this case, the restricted committee finds that the company failed to comply with the obligations incumbent on it under Article 66 of the modified law of 6 January 1978. Moreover, by collecting data from the HRi teleservice, whose usage and access are strictly regulated, the company violated the principle of lawful data processing for commercial purposes, a factor to consider when determining the fine amount. 159. Furthermore, the restricted committee notes the extensive scope of the processing. From 1 January 2021 to 2 April 2021, the number of entries received by CEGEDIM SANTÉ exceeded \[…\], which is significant and demonstrates the scale of the processing involved. This scale and the richness of the data processed also reflect their historical depth, with the company retrieving HRi teleservice data over a twelve-month period. 160. Thirdly, the restricted committee considers that the CNIL cannot be blamed for not asking the company to regularize its processing earlier, despite being aware of it before the 2021 inspections. The restricted committee recalls that under the principle of accountability introduced by Articles 5(2) and 24 of the GDPR, it is up to the actors to inquire about their obligations and undertake the necessary steps to comply. The restricted committee believes that the company exhibited negligence by assuming it could implement health data processing while ignoring Article 66 of the Informatique et Libertés law. Given that processing health data is the company’s primary and historical activity, the restricted committee believes the company could not, in good faith, overlook its obligations under personal data protection regulations, especially as a specialized actor in the health field and considering the aforementioned available doctrine, particularly since other companies implementing similar processing on the same market have requested CNIL authorizations, which are public. 161. Fourthly, the restricted committee considers it appropriate to apply the criterion in point g) of Article 83(2) of the GDPR concerning the categories of personal data affected by the breaches. 162. The restricted committee recalls that the data involved are mainly health data, categorized as special categories of data under Article 9 of the GDPR, known as sensitive data. Given the nature of the data involved and the sector in which it operates, the restricted committee believes the company should have exhibited particular vigilance concerning the processing it implements. 163. Finally, the restricted committee notes that under Article 20, paragraph IV, of the Informatique et Libertés law, CEGEDIM SANTÉ faces a financial penalty up to a maximum of €20 million or 4% of its annual worldwide turnover from the previous financial year, whichever is higher. It notes that the turnover of CEGEDIM LOGICIELS MEDICAUX France, from which CEGEDIM SANTÉ has taken over all activities, was \[…\] in 2021. 164. Therefore, considering the breaches identified, the company’s financial capabilities, and the relevant criteria of Article 83(2) of the GDPR mentioned above, the restricted committee believes an €800,000 fine is justified. B. On the imposition of an order 165. On one hand, regarding the rapporteur’s proposed order to anonymize the data or bring the processing in line with the provisions of Article 66 of the modified law of 6 January 1978, the restricted committee notes that the company has indicated substantial changes in the processing during the sanction procedure. According to the information submitted by the company in its defense observations, data from the CROSSWAY flow is now transmitted directly to the company \[…\], without CEGEDIM SANTÉ acting as an intermediary. 166. Therefore, in any event, there is no need to issue an order to comply with the provisions of Article 66 of the modified law of 6 January 1978 for the processing operated by CEGEDIM SANTÉ, as the company no longer operates within this framework. 167. On the other hand, if the restricted committee were to uphold the breach of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR, the company requests that the rapporteur's proposed order mandating it to cease collecting HRi teleservice data not be followed. It alternatively proposes to modify the CROSSWAY software to eliminate the automatic download feature of HRi data by physicians, only making download into the patient record possible through a positive action by doctors. 168. The restricted committee takes note of the company’s willingness, as the software editor, to evolve the CROSSWAY flow so that the processing complies with the applicable provisions. Additionally, for the above-mentioned reasons, mainly due to CEGEDIM SANTÉ no longer being responsible for processing since this July but merely the software editor, the restricted committee considers there is no need to issue an order. C. On the publicity 169. The rapporteur considers that the sanction’s publicity is necessary given the severity of the breaches and the number of individuals concerned. The rapporteur believes that publicity will help inform the individuals concerned about the processing of their data, including health data, which most of them are unaware of. 170. In defense, the company disputes the rapporteur’s proposal to make this decision public and claims that if the breach were as severe as the rapporteur asserts, the CNIL would not have allowed it to persist without corrective action since 2014. The company adds that making the deliberation public would cause commercial harm and risk disclosing information on data hosting and transmission, potentially jeopardizing data security. 171. The company also states it lacks the financial means to communicate with physicians to retain their participation in the observatory, adding that, generally, publicizing the sanction would put it at real risk concerning its survival given its precarious financial health. 172. Lastly, the company argues that the rapporteur cannot validly invoke the need to inform individuals about the processing conducted by the company to justify the sanction’s publicity, as there is no accusation of the company failing to inform individuals, with individuals having been informed personally by their physicians about the processing's existence and the company having no direct contact with the individuals concerned. 173. The restricted committee believes making this decision public is justified given the severity of the breaches and the number of individuals affected. It recalls that in case of publicity, the information covered by business secrecy, per Article L. 151 of the Commercial Code, is removed from the decisions published by the restricted committee. Regarding the argument about the impact of publicity on relationships with partner physicians, the committee emphasizes that the company can communicate with its partners about the actions taken to comply with its obligations. 174. Concerning the information of individuals, the restricted committee considers that even though the company is not blamed for failing to inform individuals about the existing processing in this procedure, it is essential that individuals are aware of the company's breaches, particularly to assert their rights. Rights 175. The measure is proportionate since the decision will no longer identify the company by name after a period of two years from its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The restricted committee of the CNIL, after deliberation, decides to: - Impose an administrative fine on the company CEGEDIM SANTÉ in the amount of eight hundred thousand euros (€800,000) for breaches of Article 66 of the Law No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 as amended and Article 5, paragraph 1, a) of the GDPR; - Publish its deliberation on the CNIL’s website and on the Légifrance website, which will no longer identify the company by name after two years from its publication. The President Philippe-Pierre CABOURDIN This decision may be appealed before the Council of State within two months of its notification."

Please refer to the French original for more details. The Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés, meeting in its restricted formation composed of Messrs Philippe-Pierre CABOURDIN, Chairman, Vincent LESCLOUS, Vice-Chairman, Ms Laurence FRANCESCHINI and Messrs Bertrand DU MARAIS and Alain DRU, members; Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of personal data and the free movement of such data ; Having regard to Act no. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Data Processing, Data Files and Individual Liberties, as amended, in particular Articles 20 et seq; Having regard to Decree no. 2019-536 of 29 May 2019, as amended, for the application of Law no. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 relating to information technology, files and freedoms; Having regard to deliberation no. 2013-175 of 4 July 2013 adopting the rules of procedure of the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés ; Having regard to decision no. 2022-104C of 21 June 2022 of the President of the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (French Data Protection Authority) to instruct the Secretary General to carry out, or have carried out, an audit of the processing operations implemented by the company KASPR; Having regard to the report of Mr Fabien TARISSAN, reporting commissioner, notified to the company KASPR on 3 May 2024; Having regard to the written observations submitted by counsel for KASPR on 13 June 2024; Having regard to the rapporteur's reply to these observations, served on KASPR on 12 July 2024; Having regard to the written observations submitted by counsel for KASPR, received on 19 August 2024; Having regard to the oral observations made at the meeting of the restricted formation; Having regard to the other documents in the file; The following were present at the meeting of the restricted formation on 19 September 2024: - Mr Fabien TARISSAN, commissioner, heard in his report; As representatives of KASPR: - \[...\]. KASPR having spoken last; The restricted formation adopted the following decision: I. Facts and procedure 1. Founded in 2018, KASPR (hereinafter ‘the Company’) has its registered office at 38 rue Dunois in Paris (75013) and its operational offices at 198 avenue de France in Paris (75013). The company has 32 employees. It generated sales of approximately EUR \[...\] in 2021, EUR \[...\] in 2022 and EUR \[...\] in 2023. 2. KASPR develops and markets an extension (hereinafter ‘the KASPR extension’) available from the ‘kaspr.io’ website and running on the CHROME browser, which enables users to obtain the professional contact details of people whose profiles they visit on the LinkedIn social network. 3. On 28 July 2022, following several referrals, and pursuant to Decision No. 2022-104C of 21 June 2022 of the President of the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (hereinafter ‘the CNIL’ or ‘the Commission’), the Commission's departments conducted a hearing inspection of the company's representatives. 4. The purpose of this audit was to verify the compliance of the personal data processing implemented by KASPR with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of personal data (hereinafter ‘the GDPR’ or ‘the Regulation’), Law no. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties (hereinafter ‘the Data Processing and Individual Liberties Law’) and, where applicable, with the provisions of Articles L251-1 et seq. of the French Internal Security Code. 5. By e-mail dated 9 August 2022, the company sent the CNIL a number of documents and responses requested by the Commission's departments as part of the investigations. 6. On 8 April 2024, for the purpose of investigating these items, the President of the Commission appointed Mr Fabien TARISSAN as rapporteur on the basis of Article 39 of Decree no. 2019-536 of 29 May 2019 implementing the Data Protection Act. 7. On 3 May 2024, at the end of his investigation, the rapporteur sent the company a report detailing the breaches of the GDPR that he considered to have occurred in this case. 8. This report proposed that the Commission's select committee impose an administrative fine on the company, as well as an injunction to bring the processing into compliance with Articles 5, 6, 12, 14 and 15 of the RGPD, together with a penalty payment at the end of a period of three months following notification of the select committee's decision. It also proposed that this decision be made public and that the company no longer be identified by name two years after its publication. 9. By e-mail dated 17 May 2024, the company requested additional time from the chairman of the restricted panel to produce its observations in response, which was granted on 23 May 2019, on the basis of Article 40, paragraph 4 of the Decree of 29 May 2019. 10. On 13 June 2024, the company submitted its observations in response to the rapporteur's report. 11. On 12 July 2024, the rapporteur replied to the company's observations. 12. On 19 August 2024 the company submitted further observations in response. 13. By letter dated 6 September 2024, the company received an invitation to attend the meeting of the select committee on the following 19 September. 14. The company and the rapporteur presented oral observations at the meeting of the restricted panel on 19 September 2024. I. Reasons for the decision A. On the processing in question 15. The KASPR tool is an extension for the CHROME browser which, when a person's profile on LinkedIn is visited, displays the professional contact details (telephone number and e-mail address) of natural persons in the KASPR database. To access this service, users must purchase and spend ‘credits’ to display the contact details of the desired person (the target). The number of credits available to the user is determined by the price of the subscription, which may be monthly or annual. 16. In this case, the Select Committee notes that the company processes the personal data of two distinct categories of people: - the target persons, i.e. the persons whose professional details have been collected by the company from various sources, including the LinkedIn social network, and entered into its database ; - users of the KASPR extension, i.e. the company's customers whose subscription allows them to visit the LinkedIn profiles of the target persons in order, in particular, to obtain their professional details. 17. The purpose of the KASPR extension is to enable these users to contact the target persons, for example for commercial prospecting, recruitment or identity verification, using the professional contact details obtained. The only data that can be displayed by the extension when a LinkedIn profile is visited is the telephone number and email address. The data collected concerning the contact data of target persons is the surname, first name, email address, telephone number, URL of the LinkedIn profile or other social networks, employer, company, job title, skills, professional interests, career, date of hire and end of position, training, place of work, source of data and date of collection. 18. The Panel notes that the company collects data from three sources: - ‘suppliers’ who themselves collect data from publicly accessible professional sources such as LinkedIn, Whois, GitHub ; - the directories of domain name registries, which can be used to search for information about an existing domain name and its owner; - the import of a user's LinkedIn contacts when KASPR is activated. KASPR users synchronise the KASPR extension with their LinkedIn account. The delegation was informed that this makes it possible to retrieve the contact details available on LinkedIn of users' direct contacts but which are not necessarily visible to all visitors to the LinkedIn site. The KASPR extension thus makes it possible to make available, in the KASPR database, data that the LinkedIn contacts of KASPR users wanted to limit to their contacts within the professional social network. 19. Approximately 160 million contacts are included in the database created by the company, including precisely \[...\] in the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, the geographical origin being determined by the workplace address. B. Jurisdiction of the CNIL and application of the consistency mechanism 20. Article 3(1) of the GDPR provides that ‘This Regulation shall apply to the processing of personal data carried out in the course of the activities of an establishment of a controller or processor on the territory of the Union, whether or not the processing takes place within the Union’. 21. Under Article 56(1) of the Regulation, ‘the supervisory authority of the main establishment or sole establishment of the controller or processor shall be competent to act as lead supervisory authority with regard to cross-border processing carried out by that controller or processor, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 60’. 22. The criteria for determining whether a supervisory authority is concerned are set out in Article 4 (22) of the GDPR which provides that an authority is ‘concerned by the processing of personal data because: (a) the controller or processor is established on the territory of the Member State to which that supervisory authority is subject ; (b) data subjects residing in the Member State of that supervisory authority are or are likely to be significantly affected by the processing; or (c) a complaint has been lodged with that supervisory authority’. 23. The rapporteur considers that, pursuant to Article 3(1) of the GDPR, where the activities of the controller take place within the territory of the Union, the obligations contained in the GDPR apply to all data subjects affected by the processing, whether or not they are located within the European Union. 24. Furthermore, the rapporteur considers that, since the CNIL delegation noted the presence in the KASPR database of personal data of persons located in Sweden, Hungary and the Land of Saxony, these authorities are concerned. 25. In its defence, although the company does not contest the CNIL's status as the competent authority for determining whether the processing at issue complies with the GDPR, it maintains that the CNIL is not competent to rule, as the lead authority, on whether the processing of personal data of persons located in Hungary, Sweden and the Land of Saxony complies with the GDPR, since these authorities have declared that they are not concerned. Secondly, with regard to the territorial scope of the GDPR, the company considers that when assessing the number of people affected by the alleged breaches, it cannot take into account people located outside the European Union. The company argues that in its judgment of 24 September 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union held, on the occasion of a preliminary ruling on the territorial scope of the right to dereference, that the GDPR could only produce effect within the territory of the European Union (CJEU, Grand Chamber, 24 September 2019, Google, n°C-507/17). 26. The restricted panel noted that KASPR's sole establishment was in France, that the processing at issue therefore took place in the context of the activity of that establishment, and that the CNIL was therefore the competent authority to examine the compliance of the processing with the RGPD, which was not disputed by the company. 27. In accordance with Article 56 of the RGPD, on 19 September 2023 the CNIL informed all the European supervisory authorities of its competence to act as lead supervisory authority with regard to the cross-border processing implemented by the company, a competence derived by the CNIL from the fact that the company's main establishment is in France. In this respect, the Select Committee notes that the form entitled ‘Article 56 - Identification of LSA and CSA’, sent to all the other European data protection authorities, is intended solely to enable the other authorities to be aware of the opening of a file by the lead authority and is not intended to conclusively determine their status as the authority concerned at this stage. Conversely, the Select Committee notes that the presence of data concerning persons established on the territory of a particular Member State is decisive in identifying the authorities concerned. 28. In this case, the CNIL's supervisory delegation noted that in addition to all the other contacts in the database, \[...\] contacts in the KASPR database are located in Sweden, \[...\] contacts are located in Hungary and \[...\] contacts are located in Germany. All European authorities are therefore concerned within the meaning of Article 4(22) of the Regulation. 29. Thus, the Select Committee considers that the criterion set out in Article 4(22)(b) of the GDPR is indeed met in this case, since it has been found that ‘data subjects residing in the Member State of that supervisory authority are or are likely to be significantly affected by the processing operation’. 30. In addition, the Select Committee points out that a data controller whose establishment is located within the territory of the European Union is required to comply with the GDPR in respect of all persons whose data it processes, without making any distinction between persons according to their location. The restricted formation observes that the facts at issue in the present case differ from those referred to in the CJEU judgment on dereferencing. 31. At issue was the necessary balance between, on the one hand, the right to respect for the private life of a person located on the territory of the European Union and, on the other hand, the right to information of a person located outside the European Union, who is therefore not a data subject since his or her data were not processed. This person was a third party to the processing operation. In this case, however, the data of individuals outside the territory of the European Union is collected and processed by KASPR, which is subject to compliance with the GDPR. Thus, under the terms of Article 83(2)(a), account should be taken of the fact that the company processes 160 million contacts, it being specified that the same natural person may correspond to several contacts. 32. Pursuant to Article 60(3) of the GDPR, the draft decision adopted by the Select Committee was forwarded to the other competent European supervisory authorities, with a view to enabling them to make relevant and reasoned objections to the processing operations and breaches that concern them, on 5 November 2024. 33. As at 4 December 2024, none of the supervisory authorities concerned had raised relevant and reasoned objections to this draft decision regarding the breaches identified, so that, pursuant to Article 60(6) of the GDPR, they are deemed to have approved it. C. Breach of the obligation to have a legal basis (Article 6 of the RGPD) 34. Under Article 6 of the GDPR, ‘1. Processing shall be lawful only if, and insofar as, at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: (a) the data subject has consented to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes ; b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or for the performance of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject's request; or c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data prevail, in particular where the data subject is a child’. 35. Recourse to the legal basis of legitimate interest, pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, as a legal basis for processing is subject to three conditions: the interest pursued must be legitimate, it is necessary to process the personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued and the processing must not adversely affect the rights and interests of the persons whose data are processed, taking into account their reasonable expectations. 36. By way of illustration, with regard to the legal basis for the legitimate interest, Recital 47 of the GDPR states that such an interest may ‘constitute a legal basis for the processing, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject prevail, having regard to the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller. Such a legitimate interest could, for example, exist where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller in situations such as those where the data subject is a customer of, or in the service of, the controller’. 37. The rapporteur points out that the failure to comply with Article 6 of the GDPR described in the penalty report relates only to data collected via the LinkedIn social network - in the case of individuals who wished to restrict the display of their contact details - and not to other sources of data collection. It considers that the provision of the contact data of the target individuals by the company KASPR to its users when they had chosen not to make them public to everyone exceeds what individuals who register on a professional social network such as LinkedIn can reasonably expect. 38. In its defence, the company considers that the processing is founded on the legal basis of legitimate interest, since LinkedIn users register on that social network in order to benefit from being put in touch with other professionals, and that it is therefore not necessary to obtain their consent. It also maintains that the need to verify identity is part of the reasonable expectations of professionals in a context of increasing risks regarding the validity of digital profiles. However, it considers that the risks of phishing and identity theft raised by the rapporteur are in fact lacking and do not take into account the guarantees put in place by KASPR. The company points out that the KASPR extension deals with professional contact details and is fed by legitimate public professional sources other than LinkedIn. The company adds that the validity of this legal basis for the benefit of KASPR cannot be limited to consideration of its sole and exclusive interest and cites a CNIL publication entitled ‘La prospection commerciale par courrier électronique, Pour les professionnels (B to B)’ dated 18 May 2009, which states that ‘prospection aimed at professionals can (perfectly) be based on the legitimate interest of the organisation’. 39. Finally, the company points out that contact data is collected in accordance with the choices expressed by users of the LinkedIn social network. It states in its latest letter that users have the option of making their contact details visible via the settings in the LinkedIn interface, by choosing from four options: 1) ‘visible only to me’, 2) ‘Everyone on LinkedIn’, 3) ‘1st level relations’ and 4) ‘1st and 2nd level relations’. The company explains that it is only in these last two cases, where the user makes their email address visible to their first- and second-level contacts, that it collects the data. When people have chosen option no. 1 ‘only through me’, their data is not collected. 40. As a preliminary point, the Select Committee specifies that the breach described below concerns the personal data collected on the LinkedIn social network of target individuals who have chosen to limit or hide the visibility of their contact details. In response to one of the company's arguments, the panel also noted that the fact that the database at issue consisted solely of the ‘professional’ contact details of the target persons had no bearing on the ‘personal’ nature of that data when it related to natural persons, in accordance with the well-established case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (see, in particular, CJEU, 9 November 2010, Volker and Others, Case C-92/09 and C-93/09, pt. 59). 41. With regard to the interest pursued - in that it is commercial in nature and is consubstantial with the company's business model - the restricted formation considers that it can be described as legitimate and that the data collected for the purposes of these interests may appear necessary, an interest that may also extend to KASPR's customers who actually benefit from an interest in using these contacts for commercial prospecting or recruitment. 42. This legitimate interest pursued by the company must be considered in the light of the balancing of the interests, freedoms and fundamental rights of the data subjects and the legitimate interests pursued by the company. The Select Committee points out that in order to found processing on the basis of legitimate interest, the processing must not adversely affect the rights and interests of the persons whose data are processed, taking into account their reasonable expectations. 43. In the present case, the Select Committee considers that when individuals exercise their freedom of choice by restricting the visibility of their personal data, that choice is necessarily binding on third parties. Thus, if a professional who is registered on LinkedIn chooses to restrict the visibility of his contact details, it cannot be argued that the collection of his data by the company KASPR is among that person's reasonable expectations. 44. The restricted formation observes that it is apparent from the LinkedIn settings interface that if the target persons who chose to restrict the visibility of their contact details had really wanted their professional contact details to appear to everyone, they would have chosen to activate the setting allowing their contact details to be visible to all users. In the present case, it considers that the fact that the target persons chose to hide their contact details amounts to a form of opposition, an indispensable corollary of the legitimate interest, which must be taken into account by the company, which thus has no legitimate interest in collecting the hidden contact details. 45. Thus, by revealing the data of target persons to persons unknown to them when they had chosen to restrict the visibility of their contact details (1st and/or 2nd level relationships), the company goes directly against their ‘reasonable expectations’, within the meaning of Recital 47 of the GDPR. Furthermore, the Select Committee notes that the company's impact assessment shows that since the processing is invisible, the target individuals may ‘not be aware that KASPR or the end users of the profile data have collected their data’. Finally, while the company maintains that it has taken measures to limit the risk to individuals in its impact assessment, the Select Committee notes that the latter does not consider the case of target individuals whose data is collected even though they had chosen to hide the visibility of their contact details. It has therefore not taken any measures to limit the risk of infringement of the rights of target individuals. 46. Contrary to what the company maintains, it cannot be argued that the target persons, by authorising some of their contacts to see their contact details, intended by that action to authorise KASPR to collect such data. In that sense, there is no ‘relevant and appropriate relationship’ within the meaning of the above-mentioned recital between the target persons and the company, in that they are not users of the KASPR extension but merely contacts of KASPR customers who use the extension. 47. Furthermore, the Select Committee notes that several complainants who have been canvassed by users of the KASPR extension, either electronically or by telephone, have informed the Commission's departments of their questions about the basis and legitimacy of the company's collection and provision of their personal data. 48. Although not carried out by the company, this canvassing is made possible by the KASPR extension, which reveals to its users the contact details of the target persons in its database and leads some of its user customers to carry out this canvassing. In addition, although the company maintains that the contact details of the persons canvassed may have been collected from sources other than LinkedIn, this circumstance has no bearing on the nature of the breach in that the company was not justified in collecting the data of persons who had chosen to restrict their visibility. 49. The restricted formation emphasises that LinkedIn's privacy policy precisely insists on the fact that the data processed from its social network is processed in accordance with the users' preferences: “All the data that you include in your profile or in the content that you publish, as well as your actions on the social networks (...) carried out on our Services, are visible to other people according to your preferences”. 50. In light of all these factors, the Restricted Panel considers that the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in particular their right to privacy, took precedence over the data controller's legitimate interest in processing their data in order to ensure the operation of its extension, so that the legal basis of the company's legitimate interest cannot be accepted. 51. Finally, with regard to the other legal bases, the Restricted Panel notes that the individuals whose contact data was collected never consented in any way to the collection of their contact data, nor to its transmission to the company to ensure the operation of the KASPR extension. 52. It also points out that there is no contract between the persons concerned and KASPR, which is not disputed by the company. 53. Thus, the Restricted Panel considers that neither the legal basis of consent, nor that of the contract, nor any other legal basis (compliance with a legal obligation, safeguarding the vital interests of the data subject or performance of a task in the public interest), appears to be a valid legal basis for the processing at issue. 54. It follows from the foregoing that the collection of contact data through the import of the LinkedIn contacts of users who have decided not to make their contact data visible to all other users, used to populate the KASPR extension database, lacks a legal basis, so that a breach of Article 6 of the RGPD is constituted. D. Failure to comply with the obligation to define and respect a data retention period proportionate to the purpose of the processing (Article 5-1-e of the RGPD) 55. Under Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, personal data must be ‘kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data are processed (...)’. 56. Pursuant to these provisions, it is up to the data controller to define a retention period in line with the purpose of the processing. Once this purpose has been achieved, the data must be deleted or rendered anonymous, or be archived for a specific period of time when its retention is necessary, for example to comply with legal obligations or for pre-litigation or litigation purposes. 57. As a preliminary point, it should be noted that the company collects and retains, on the one hand, the contact data of target persons and, on the other hand, the data of users of the KASPR extension which are used by the company for commercial prospecting purposes. 58. The rapporteur notes that although the extension was created in 2018, at the hearing on 28 July 2022 the CNIL was informed that KASPR had not yet formalised a data retention policy. It was only during this adversarial procedure that the company stated that it had been considering its data retention policy since July 2021. 59. With regard to KASPR's customers, the rapporteur considers that, until the company redefined its updated confidentiality policy in June 2024, it kept customers' data for commercial prospecting purposes indefinitely as long as they had not objected. He considered that this was incompatible with the principle of keeping data for a proportionate period. 60 He went on to point out, with regard to target individuals, that the company had not defined a retention period policy at the time of the Commission's hearing on 28 July 2022 and that, in any event, the company was not justified in retaining the data of target individuals indefinitely, at the risk of causing these individuals to lose control of their data irretrievably. 61. The company maintains, with regard to KASPR customers, that the starting point for the period of retention of their data for commercial canvassing purposes is automatically renewed at each subscription expiry date until the customers cancel their subscription. It specifies that it now keeps the data for three years from the end of the subscription, and has done so since KAPSR drafted the note on data retention in July 2021. 62. The company maintains, with regard to the target persons, that the retention of such data is at the heart of the service offered by KASPR through its extension and that it has now provided for a data retention period of five years that begins to run with each periodic update of the personal data of the target persons. 63. As a preliminary point, the Select Committee emphasises that the breach of Article 5-1-e does not concern the data of individuals, which it has just been stated in paragraphs 40 to 50 were processed without a valid legal basis, which should not have been entered and kept in the database. 64. Firstly, the Restricted Panel notes, with regard to KASPR's customers, that on the day of the inspection, the company's confidentiality policy clearly indicated that customers' data were kept for commercial prospecting purposes until they objected. However, the restricted panel observed that such storage must necessarily be limited in time and that the company could not be satisfied with a lack of opposition from users to keep their data indefinitely after the end of the commercial relationship. 65. The Restricted Panel nevertheless notes that in its written submissions, the company indicated that the confidentiality policy in force on the date of the checks did not reflect the company's practice. In this regard, it produced internal documents in which the company indicated, on the one hand, that it applied a retention period of three years from the end of the commercial relationship and, on the other hand, that it purged data that had reached that retention period. 66. The Select Committee therefore considers that, with regard to the retention of the company's customer data, there has been no breach of Article 5-1-e. 67. Secondly, with regard to target persons whose data were not collected unlawfully \[i.e. persons who chose to leave their contact details visible on LinkedIn\], the Restricted Panel does not dispute the need for the company to retain the data of target persons who did not object to the processing of their data insofar as their disclosure to the company's customers constitutes the principle of the processing. It notes, however, that the company initially stated in its privacy policy that it would keep the data indefinitely and that it was only in 2021, three years after the processing was implemented, that the company began to redefine its retention period policy. 68. In any event, the restricted panel notes that the retention policy established by the company after the inspection provides that the data are retained for 5 years from each update of the data, which generally occurs when a person changes position or employer. 69. However, the restricted panel notes that for individuals who change jobs or employers within a period of less than 5 years, this renewal of the retention period leads to a disproportionate retention of their data. 70. The restricted panel considers that this automatic ‘dynamic’ retention is not compatible with compliance with the principle of proportionate retention. 71. Indeed, the target individuals are not users of the service offered by KASPR and have no relationship with the data controller. The data subjects are therefore passive vis-à-vis the processing and captive to it, since they do not choose to be included in the database. 72. The Select Committee emphasises that, unlike persons who have created an online account on a social network or an e-commerce site and for whom it is possible to determine when they became inactive, it is not, by nature, possible to determine such a time for the persons whose data KASPR processes. 73. Although the company explains that since 18 May 2022 it has set up an information campaign by e-mail that allows people to object to the processing of their data and therefore to put an end to it, the restricted panel notes that for people in the situation described in point 70, sending this message has so far been the only opportunity for them to express their wish to no longer appear in the company's database. In cases where individuals do not object to processing on receipt of this message, the company will keep their data indefinitely. 74. Thus, the restricted panel considers that the company should cease the automatic dynamic renewal of the retention of the personal data of the target persons so that KASPR does not retain their data indefinitely and indefinitely, but for five years at most. 75. It follows from the foregoing that the retention policy defined by the company is not proportionate with regard to the specific features of the processing, which constitutes a breach of Article 5-1-e of the GDPR. E. On the breach of the obligation of transparency and information to individuals (Articles 12 and 14 of the RGPD) 76. Article 12(1) of the GDPR provides that ‘the controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 as well as to make any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 regarding the processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible manner, in clear and simple language, in particular for any information specifically addressed to a child. The information shall be provided in writing or by other means including, where appropriate, by electronic means’. 77. Article 14 of the GDPR provides that where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject, the controller shall provide the data subject with the information referred to in that Article ‘within a reasonable time after obtaining the personal data, but not exceeding one month, having regard to the specific circumstances in which the personal data are processed’. 78. Thus, under this article, the controller must provide the data subject with information on the identity and contact details of the controller (and, where appropriate, the contact details of the data protection officer), the purposes of the processing operation, its legal basis, the categories of personal data concerned and, where appropriate, the recipients or categories of recipients of the data, the fact that the data controller intends to transfer the data to a third country and, if necessary to guarantee fair and transparent processing, how long the data will be kept, the existence of the various rights enjoyed by individuals, including the right to ask the data controller for access to personal data, the right to rectify personal data or the right to object to processing, the source from which the data originates and whether automated decision-making is used. 79. Under paragraph 5(b) of the same article, however, this obligation to provide information does not apply where ‘the provision of such information proves impossible or would require a disproportionate effort’ or where compliance with the obligation to provide information ‘is likely to make impossible or to seriously compromise the achievement of the purposes of the processing’. 80. In its transparency guidelines of 29 November 2017 revised on 11 April 2018, the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party points out that ‘Articles 13 and 14 refer to the obligation imposed on the controller to “\[provide\] all the following information...”. The word ‘provide’ is crucial here. It means that the controller must take concrete steps to provide the information in question to the data subject or to actively direct the data subject to the location of that information’. The guidelines thus state that ‘The data subject should not have to actively search for the information covered by these articles among other information such as the terms of use of a website or application’ (point 33). 81. The rapporteur notes, with regard to the obligation to provide information, that it was not until 18 May 2022 that the company began to inform data subjects that their personal data had been collected in an English-language e-mail with a link allowing them to object to the processing. The rapporteur considers, however, that the company was in a position to inform target individuals, as soon as the application was deployed, that their data were being processed, since the data it collects include an e-mail address. 82. The rapporteur then points out, with regard to the obligation of transparency, that the information provided in the information e-mail sent out since 18 May 2022 is written exclusively in English, which does not make it possible to provide valid information to people who do not master that language. 83. In its defence, the company submits that between 2018 and 2022, i.e. between the creation of the extension and the implementation of information emails relating to the processing, individuals were informed via the LinkedIn and KASPR privacy policies, and that if the communication implemented on 18 May 2022 was only available in English, that does not constitute a breach of the obligation of transparency since the KASPR extension is used by a public of professionals for whom that language can be considered to be commonly used within the European Union. 84. As a preliminary point, the Restricted Panel emphasises that the breach of Articles 12 and 14 does not concern the information of persons whose data has been collected unlawfully, as set out in paragraphs 40 to 50, the obligation to inform these persons being, as a result, without object. The Restricted Panel notes, however, that if the company proceeded to collect this data (which it wrongly considered to be lawful), it did not inform the data subjects either. 85. The restricted panel noted first of all, with regard to the obligation to inform, that the data of the target individuals had been collected and processed for almost 4 years, without any information being sent to them by the company, the latter only providing in its impact assessment since July 2022 that it ‘notifies all data subjects present in its database in compliance with its obligations under Article 14 of the GDPR and sets up a team dedicated to managing access requests within the time limits set’. 86. The restricted formation considers that the company cannot rely on its privacy policy or that of LinkedIn to consider that it has fulfilled its obligation to provide information to the data subjects concerned by the processing. In this regard, the restricted panel noted that in its privacy policy, LinkedIn states that ‘All of the data that you include in your profile or in the content that you publish, as well as your actions on social networks (...) carried out on our Services, are visible to other people according to your preferences’. However, KASPR's practice of making data accessible that a user wished to keep ‘private’ goes against their wishes. KASPR's confidentiality policy does not provide any specific information about the source of the data collected, stating only that ‘We collect this data from public sources, professional directories and our partners from time to time’. 87. Secondly, with regard to the obligation of transparency, the Select Committee considers that informing people whose contact details are processed by means of an e-mail available only in English does not meet the requirement of providing transparent information set out in Article 12 of the Regulation (CNIL, FR, 29 December 2023, Sanction, No. SAN 2023-023). The Select Committee recalls that according to the guidelines of the ‘Article 29’ Working Party on transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, adopted on 11 April 2018, a key aspect of the principle of transparency is that ‘the data subject should be able to determine in advance what the scope and consequences of the processing encompass so as not to be caught off guard at a later stage as to how his or her personal data have been used’ and that ‘A translation into one or more languages should be provided where the controller targets data subjects who speak those languages’. 88. In the present case, while the company maintains that the professionals whose data is collected have a good command of English if they work within the European Union, the restricted formation considers that the mere fact that these people are registered on the social network and work in a European Union country does not prejudge their level of English. Anyone can register on LinkedIn without necessarily working in a profession that requires the use of English, as the Dutch data protection authority recently pointed out in the context of a breach of the transparency obligation against the companies Uber Technologies Inc. and Uber BV. The authority considered that the controller is obliged to translate the information provided to the persons whose data are processed into a language that they understand, and that it is not possible to prejudge their level of English (Dutch data protection authority, 11 December 2023, Uber Technologies Inc. and Uber BV). 89. In the case in point, the lack of information that individuals could understand meant that, until information was made available in several languages, as the company stated in its second observations, they were unable to object to the processing and therefore to the inclusion of this data in the company's database. 90. While the company noted that some complainants had sent their request to exercise their rights in English, the restricted panel pointed out that it is not possible to presuppose the level of English of every person whose contact is present in the KASPR database, and noted in this respect that even when the complainants had addressed the company in French, the latter had replied in English. 91. Finally, the Restricted Panel notes that the company indicated for the first time in its observations filed on 19 August 2024 that it now allowed individuals to select the language of their choice regarding the KASPR information email and privacy policy in order to read them in French, Spanish, Dutch or German, without however specifying the date on which this option was implemented, or why these documents were not made available in all the languages spoken within the European Union. 92. It follows from the foregoing that between 2018 and 2022 no information was provided to target persons who had not restricted the visibility of their data and that since 2022 information has been provided in English, which does not meet the requirement of transparency, so that there is a breach of Articles 12 and 14 until the possibility for persons to select the language of their choice is introduced. F. Failure to comply with the obligation to comply with requests to exercise the right of access (Article 15 of the RGPD) 93. Under Article 15(1)(g) of the Regulation, ‘the data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data relating to him or her are being processed and, where such data are processed, access to them and, \[...\] where the personal data have not been obtained from the data subject, any available information as to their source’. 94. Article 12(4) of the GDPR provides that ‘the controller shall provide the data subject with information on the measures taken in response to a request made pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 as soon as possible and in any event within one month of receipt of the request’. 95. The rapporteur notes that it appears from several referrals that complainants who have been canvassed and who have questioned KASPR about the origin of the data have not received any precise reply from the company, which has merely told them that the data were available from publicly accessible sources. 96. The rapporteur considers that, since the company is able to identify some of the sources used to collect the data in its database, it should have cited the possible sources of collection in the context of the access requests, even if it was unable to tell the complainants the precise source from which the personal data concerning them was collected. 97. In its defence, the company argues that the inclusion of complaints made after the hearing infringes the rights of the defence in that it was only when preparing its observations in response to the rapporteur's report that it had the opportunity to demonstrate how those complaints had been handled. 98. The company added that, prior to January 2022, it did not have the technical capacity to trace separately the various categories of data sources included in the KASPR database, and that it was not in a position to do so retroactively from January 2022. 99. The restricted formation considers, firstly, that the company had the necessary time and facilities to provide any evidence likely to demonstrate the outcome of the complaints communicated by the rapporteur in support of his initial report. It considered that there had been no infringement of the rights of the defence, as the breaches had occurred before the penalty was imposed. 100. Secondly, the Restricted Section considers that the company must be able to indicate ‘any available information as to the source’ of the data it holds on individuals pursuant to the aforementioned Article 15, in particular where the individual's business telephone number was obtained, if it has this information. In the present case, it is clear from the referrals that the complainants questioned how the company had obtained their contact details, but were not given a precise answer, the company merely stating that the data was available from publicly accessible sources. While the company maintained that, in accordance with the EDPS Guidelines on the rights of data subjects - right of access n°01/2022 of 28 March 2023, it had responded to access requests by setting up a second-level referral mechanism to more precise information, the restricted panel noted that the same guidelines, which set out an example, stated that: ‘If it is not possible to determine ex ante which of the companies will be involved in the processing, it is sufficient to mention the names of the eligible companies in the privacy policy. In the context of a request based on Article 15, in addition to the information according to which information relating to solvency has been obtained, it would then be necessary (a posteriori) to indicate exactly which companies have been involved. It is clear from Article 15(1)(g) that information on data processing includes ‘any available information as to its source’ where the personal data are not obtained from the data subject. 101. The restricted formation considers that although the company could provide the information required by the aforementioned Article 15 in the context of second-level information, i.e. by including a link in the information e-mail referring to the KASPR website and in particular to its data confidentiality policy, this is not sufficiently precise in view of the information available to the company on the sources of the data. The privacy policy in force at the time of the company's response to the complainants states, with regard to the origin of the personal data of target individuals: ‘We collect this data from public sources, professional directories and our partners on an ad hoc basis’. However, it is clear from the documents in the file that KASPR has precisely identified some of the sources that feed its database. 102. In fact, it indicated to the inspection delegation three main sources of data (point 19), which are now referred to in the latest version of its confidentiality policy: ‘We collect this data from social networks such as LinkedIn, professional directories such as Whois and GitHub and from our data suppliers from time to time’. 103. However, the Restricted Panel considers that the reference to ‘our data suppliers from time to time’ does not provide any details about the various ‘suppliers’ referred to in this case and considers that once KASPR is aware of the various precise sources, it is up to it to provide information about them. 104. The company was therefore in a position to provide more information to the complainants about the sources of the data, even though it was not in a position to tell the complainants the precise source. 105. The restricted panel recalls that the purpose of the right of access is to enable the data subject to become aware of the processing of his or her data and to verify its lawfulness. Exercising this right therefore presupposes that the information provided is as accurate as possible (CNIL, FR, 30 November 2022, Sanction, No. SAN 2022-022). 106. It follows from the foregoing that the company did not inform the target persons who exercised their right of access about the source from which it had collected their data, so that a breach of Article 15 of the GDPR is constituted. II. Corrective measures and publicity 107. Under Article 58(2) of the RGPD, ‘Each supervisory authority shall have the power to adopt any of the following corrective measures: \[...\] (c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests made by the data subject to exercise his or her rights under this Regulation; (d) order the controller or the processor to bring the processing operations into conformity with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specific manner and within a specific period of time; \[...\] (e) order the controller or the processor to carry out the processing operations in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specific manner and within a specific period of time (i) impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the specific features of each case’. 108. III of Article 20 of the amended Act of 6 January 1978 provides that: ‘when the data controller or its processor does not comply with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or from this Act, the Chairman of the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés may \[...\] refer the matter to the Commission's restricted panel with a view to pronouncing, after adversarial proceedings, one or more of the following measures : \[...\] 2° An injunction to bring the processing into compliance with the obligations resulting from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or from this Act, or to comply with requests made by the data subject to exercise his or her rights, which may be accompanied, except in cases where the processing is implemented by the State, by a penalty payment, the amount of which may not exceed €100,000 per day of delay from the date set by the restricted panel; \[...\] 7° With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an administrative fine not exceeding €10 million or, in the case of a company, 2% of the total annual worldwide turnover for the previous financial year, whichever is greater. In the cases referred to in Article 83(5) and (6) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, these ceilings are raised to €20 million and 4% of the said turnover respectively. In determining the amount of the fine, the Restricted Panel shall take into account the criteria specified in the same Article 83.’ 109. Article 83 of the RGPD further provides that ‘each supervisory authority shall ensure that the administrative fines imposed \[...\] are, in each case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive’, before specifying the factors that must be taken into account in deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the amount of that fine. 110. In determining the amount of the fine, the restricted panel must take into account criteria such as the number of violations, their nature and seriousness, the number of persons concerned and the financial benefits obtained as a result of the breach. 111. The company argues that its treatment is legitimate, that the imposition of a fine is unfounded in the absence of actual breaches and that the imposition of a fine would be tantamount to refusing to take into account compliance measures that already exist. The company then argued that the amount of the fine was disproportionate to the seriousness of the breaches and KASPR's behaviour, which should constitute a ‘mitigating factor’. Lastly, the company maintains that the proposed injunction is devoid of purpose and that publicising the penalty would be counterproductive with regard to a company that has invested in an RGPD compliance process. 112. In the first place, the restricted panel points out that, while the imposition of an administrative fine is conditional on the establishment of a culpable breach on the part of the body being prosecuted, that fault may arise from deliberate conduct but also from negligence, pursuant to subparagraph (b) of Article 83(2) of the GDPR (CJEU, Grand Chamber, 5 December 2023, Deutsche Wohnen SE and Others, C-807/21; CJEU, Grand Chamber, 5 December 2023, Nacionalinis visuomenės sveikatos centras prie Sveikatos apsaugos ministerijos and Others, C-683/21). 113. The restricted formation considers that, in the present case, the breaches committed by the company reveal definite negligence on its part. In fact, the restricted panel emphasised, on the one hand, that the rules set out in this decision are constantly interpreted by the CNIL. For example, the select committee has already ruled on the right of access, stating that the information provided must be as precise as possible (CNIL, FR, 30 November 2022, Sanction, No. SAN 2022-022), but also on the obligation of transparency by considering that informing people whose details are processed by an email available only in English does not meet the requirement of providing transparent information set out in Article 12 of the Regulation (CNIL, FR, 29 December 2023, Sanction, n°SAN 2023-023). On the other hand, the Select Committee noted that the multiplicity of breaches demonstrated negligence in the implementation of the processing carried out by the company. 114 Secondly, the Restricted Panel considers that the criterion set out in Article 83(2)(a) of the GDPR relating to the nature, seriousness and duration of the breach should be applied, taking into account the nature and scope of the processing and the number of data subjects. 115. The Select Committee notes first of all that breaches of Articles 5(1)(e) and 6 of the GDPR concern the fundamental principles of data protection and may therefore be subject to a fine of up to €20 million or 4% of the company's annual turnover for the previous financial year - the maximum amount provided for in the legislation - pursuant to Article 83(5) of the GDPR. In this respect, Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the RGPD adopted on 24 May 2023 by the European Data Protection Committee point out that ‘through this distinction, the legislator has given an initial indication of the seriousness of the breach, in an abstract manner. The more serious the breach, the higher the fine is likely to be’ (point 50). 116. The restricted formation then notes, as it explained in paragraph 31 of this deliberation, that the breaches of Articles 5-1-e, 12 and 14 identified are likely to concern a large number of people, as the KASPR database included nearly 160 million contacts on the day of the hearing inspection, since all of the contacts present in the KASPR database should be taken into account, as they are persons affected by the RGPD. 117. The restricted panel also emphasises that for people who have decided not to post their contact details on LinkedIn, the processing presents a particularly strong infringement of people's rights insofar as it goes against their wish to keep this data private in order, in particular, to canvass them, as corroborated by the various complaints received by the Commission's departments. 118. This uncertainty about the extent of the breach of the confidentiality of their data is compounded by the inconvenience caused by these untimely canvassings, as denounced by the complainants in the referrals received by the Commission. 119. Finally, the restricted panel notes that examination of the complaints also highlights the shortcomings of the procedures for exercising rights implemented within the company, which does not respond precisely to complainants wishing to know the source from which their contact data was obtained indirectly. 120 Thirdly, the Restricted Panel intends to apply the criterion set out in Article 83(2)(k) of the GDPR, relating to the financial benefits obtained as a result of the breach. 121. In this regard, it notes that the company derives all of its revenue from billing its customers for a service whose operation is based in part on data collected unlawfully and, until 2022, without the knowledge of the data subjects. 122. Thus, the company's entire business model is based on the infringement of major provisions of the GDPR, in that the database from which its extension operates was partly constituted unlawfully. 123. Fourthly, the Select Committee intends to take account of the measures taken by the company to mitigate the breaches, pursuant to Article 83(2)(c) of the RGPD. It appears that, following receipt of the penalty report, the company has implemented a new retention period for KASPR user data and, for the company's information email and privacy policy, has made it possible for data subjects to choose the language of the text in French, Spanish, Dutch or German. 124. The restricted panel considers that all of these elements justify the imposition of an administrative fine. (125) With regard to the amount of the fine, the Select Committee recalls that the violations identified are liable to be the subject, pursuant to Article 83 of the GDPR, of an administrative fine of up to €20 million or up to 4% of the worldwide annual turnover for the previous financial year, whichever is higher. 126. It considers that the company's business and financial situation must be taken into account. In this respect, it notes that KASPR generated sales of EUR \[...\] and profits of EUR \[...\] in 2022. The following year, this turnover amounted to EUR \[...\], with a profit of EUR \[...\]. 127. In view of the company's liability, its financial capacity and the relevant criteria of Article 83(2) of the GDPR referred to above, the Restricted Panel considers that a fine of two hundred and forty thousand (240,000) euros appears justified. 128. With regard to issuing an injunction accompanied by a penalty payment, the rapporteur proposes in his report to the restricted formation to issue a compliance injunction against the company, accompanied by a penalty payment, for the breaches of Articles 5-1-e, 6, 12, 14 and 15 of the RGPD. 129. The company considers that the injunctive measures proposed by the rapporteur have no purpose, since the company has brought its processing into compliance as best it can given its resources. 130 Firstly, with regard to the legal basis, the Restricted Panel notes that the company continues to process data that has been collected in the absence of a valid basis. 131. Consequently, the Restricted Panel considers it necessary to issue an injunction so that the company complies with the applicable obligations in this area. 132. Secondly, with regard to the obligation to define and comply with a data retention period proportionate to the purpose of the processing, the restricted panel notes that the company has not indicated that it has implemented a proportionate retention period policy for target persons. 133. Consequently, the restricted panel considers it necessary to uphold the injunction on these points. 134. Thirdly, with regard to the failure to comply with the obligation to grant requests to exercise the right of access, the Restricted Panel notes that the complainants have still not been informed of the precise source of the data concerning them collected by the company. 135. Consequently, the Restricted Panel considers that the injunction is justified on this point. 136. Lastly, with regard to the terms and conditions of the injunction with penalty payment, the Restricted Panel notes that in order to preserve the penalty payment's comminatory function, its amount must be both proportionate to the seriousness of the breaches committed and adapted to the controller's financial capacities. It also considers that in determining this amount, account must be taken of the fact that the breach to which the injunction relates directly contributes to the profits generated by the controller. 137. In light of these factors, the restricted panel considers that the imposition of a penalty payment of 10,000 euros per day of delay, to be liquidated at the end of a six-month period, is justified. 138. With regard to the publication of the penalty, the Restricted Section considers that this is justified in light of the seriousness of some of the breaches in question, the company's position on the market, the scope of the processing and the number of persons concerned. 139. It also notes that the purpose of this measure is to inform data subjects of the processing operations carried out by the company, whether they are users of the extension or target persons. This information will enable them, where appropriate, to assert their rights. 140 Lastly, it considers that this measure is proportionate given that the decision will no longer identify the company by name two years after its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The CNIL's select committee, after deliberation, decides to : - impose an administrative fine on the company KASPR in the amount of two hundred and forty thousand (240,000) euros with regard to the breaches constituted by Articles 5-1-e), 6, 12, 14 and 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 ; - issue an injunction against KASPR: o as regards the breach of Article 6 of the GDPR, - to stop collecting contact data from KASPR users who have chosen to limit the visibility of their contact details; - to delete all contact data imported when synchronising the LinkedIn accounts of users who have chosen to limit the visibility of their contact details or, failing that, if it is impossible to distinguish this data whose visibility has been limited from other data, to inform them, within a period of 3 months, of the processing of their data and of the possibility of objecting to it and to use the data only for this purpose; o with regard to the failure to comply with Article 5-1-e of the RGPD, concerning target persons, to stop automatically renewing the 5-year retention period for target persons' data as soon as their profile is updated, and to retain data only for a period that is proportionate to the processing operation; o with regard to the failure to comply with Articles 12 and 14 of the GDPR: to inform data subjects of all the information provided for in this article in a language that they understand; o with regard to the failure to comply with Article 15 of the GDPR, - to comply with requests for right of access from individuals by providing them with all available information as to the source from which their contact data was added to the company's database; - and to comply with requests for access from persons who have lodged complaints \[...\] under the same conditions, before deleting the data relating to the complaints \[...\]. - make the injunction subject to a penalty payment of ten thousand euros (€10,000) per day of delay at the end of a period of six months following notification of this resolution, with proof of compliance to be sent to the select committee within this period; - make its decision public on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, which will no longer allow the company to be identified by name at the end of a period of two years from its publication. The Chairman Philippe-Pierre CABOURDIN This decision may be appealed to the Conseil d'État within two months of its notification."

FACTS AND PROCEDURE 1. CALOGA (hereinafter the company) is a simplified joint-stock company (société par actions simplifiée) located at 75 rue Guy Moquet in Malakoff (92240). Founded in 2000, CALOGA pursues two activities: it conducts electronic sales prospecting operations on behalf of advertisers using prospects in its databases, compiled from primary collection partners who organize competitions, among other things. It also acts as a data broker, transmitting data collected by first-time data collectors to partners who conduct commercial prospecting for their own advertisers. 2. In 2021, CALOGA had nine employees. For the same year, it generated revenue of \[…\] euros and a net profit of \[…\] euros. The company then gradually ceased operations. In 2022, its revenue amounted to \[…\] euros and a net profit of \[…\] euros. In 2023, its revenue amounted to \[…\] euros and a net loss of \[…\] euros. 3. Pursuant to Decision No. 2022-052C of March 25, 2022, issued by the President of the French National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties (hereinafter the CNIL or the Commission), an inspection was carried out on May 11 and 12, 2022, at the company's premises. The purpose of this inspection was to verify the compliance of the company's processing operations with the provisions of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, relating to information technology, data files, and civil liberties (hereinafter the French Data Protection Act or the Act of January 6, 1978, as amended) and other provisions relating to the protection of personal data provided for by laws and regulations, European Union law, and France's international commitments. 4. Minutes No. 2022-052/1 and No. 2022-052/2 dated May 11 and 12, 2022, were notified to the company following the on-site inspections. Several exchanges between the company and the delegation took place between May 2022 and May 2023. 5. To examine these elements, the Chair of the Commission appointed Ms. Aminata Niakaté as rapporteur on April 22, 2024, on the basis of Article 22 of the amended Law of January 6, 1978. 6. On 21 June 2024, following her investigation, the rapporteur served the company with a report detailing the breaches of Articles 5(1)(e), 6, and 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (hereinafter the Regulation or the GDPR) and Article L. 34-5 of the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code (hereinafter CPCE) that she considered to have occurred in this case. This report proposed that the restricted committee impose an administrative fine on the company. It also proposed that this decision be made public, but that it would no longer be possible to identify the company by name after a period of two years from its publication. 7. Several written exchanges subsequently took place between the rapporteur and the company, until the investigation was closed and served on the company on December 3, 2024. 8. Following the written adversarial procedure, the rapporteur and the company presented oral observations at the restricted committee meeting. II. REASONS FOR THE DECISION A. Regarding the processing operations in question and the liability of CALOGA 9. Pursuant to Article 4(2) of the GDPR, the processing of personal data means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction. Article 4(7) of the GDPR defines the controller as the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing. 10. The Restricted Committee notes that, in the commercial prospecting ecosystem, the capacity to be conferred on the various actors in the chain in terms of processing responsibility – namely the advertiser on whose behalf the electronic prospecting is sent and the intermediary acting between it and the initial collector, who may in particular be responsible for sending electronic prospecting messages for the advertiser – depends on a certain number of parameters (such as, for example, the ownership of the database, its methods of creation and management, the choices made in terms of segmentation or the degree and precision of the instructions given by the advertiser). These allocations and distributions of responsibilities between the various actors may vary depending on the roles and actions carried out by each, depending on the specific case, and they must therefore be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. The qualification retained by the actors themselves, particularly in their contractual acts, constitutes an important element to take into account, but not decisive if it does not correspond to the reality of the criteria of article 4 of the GDPR. Depending on the circumstances, the advertiser, i.e. the entity wishing to promote its products or services, may be considered data controllers (see CNIL, FR, August 3, 2022, no. SAN-2022-017, published; CNIL, November 24, 2022, no. SAN-2022-021, published; CNIL, FR, October 12, 2023, no. SAN-2023-015, published; CE, March 23, 2015, GROUPE DSE, no. 357556, Rec.) or certain specialized service providers offering advertising services and marketing products (see CE, March 11, 2015, TUTO4PC, no. 368624, T; CNIL, FR, December 7, 2020, SAN-2020-016, published). These service providers include companies that compile contact databases from various third-party sources (known as primary collectors), which they resell to partners or use to offer commercial prospecting services to advertisers. Depending on the configuration, these companies may be subcontractors of the advertiser or data controllers for prospecting operations, without precluding possible joint liability between the advertiser and its service provider. 11. In the area of commercial prospecting, the Restricted Committee, for example, held that an organization whose activity is the creation of a database of contacts intended for commercial prospecting by electronic means and the sending of prospecting emails to advertisers is the data controller, on the basis of the following elements: firstly, with regard to the determination of the purposes, the Restricted Committee notes that \[…\] the company is the owner of the database used in the context of prospecting campaigns, with advertisers and web agencies not providing the personal data of the prospects to be contacted and not having access to the personal data of the prospects. Secondly, the Restricted Committee considers that the company determines the essential means of processing in that it defines the personal data contained in its prospect database, the periods for which this data is kept there and any updates that need to be made. Consequently, and without it being necessary in this case to rule on a possible joint liability of the advertising partners of the company \[…\], the restricted committee holds that the latter has defined the purposes and means of the processing linked to the management and provision of its personal database for the purposes of commercial prospecting by email (CNIL, FR, December 7, 2020, SAN-2020-016, published).12. The rapporteur first considers that CALOGA acts as the data controller for electronic prospecting activities carried out using the data contained in its databases on behalf of its advertising clients. Second, with regard to the transmission of prospect data to its partners so that they can carry out electronic prospecting operations on behalf of advertisers, the rapporteur considers that CALOGA acts as a joint data controller with the partners receiving the data. 13. The company confirms its status as the data controller for database management and electronic prospecting operations carried out on behalf of advertisers. With regard to prospect data transmission operations, the company considers, unlike the rapporteur, that its partners are processors, and that the requirement for valid consent from prospects for the transmission of their data cannot be imposed on it in this context, as the data is transmitted to subcontractors. The legal basis for this processing, according to the company, would be legitimate interest. It states that it has conducted a personal analysis of the status of the various parties involved and cannot be criticized for having reached a different conclusion from that of the CNIL. 14. Regarding the creation of CALOGA's databases, the Restricted Committee notes that CALOGA purchases its data, collected through competitions or product tests, from commercial partners (the ""primary collectors"") to create its prospect databases, which it owns. As such, it is stipulated, in particular in the contract entered into with the company \[...\], the data provider, that CALOGA itself becomes a data controller when it uses the personal data of Internet users who have agreed to join its database to implement processing operations for which it has defined the purposes and means. The data collected in this context include surname, first name, title, email address, postal code, date of birth, and, occasionally, postal address. It also notes that the company implements this commercial prospecting process by canvassing prospects present in its four databases (CALOGA, ZEPLAN, BASYLO, or VOZEKO) and by choosing the segments to be canvassed itself. 15. It thus appears that the company is responsible for the processing relating to the creation of its four contact databases. 16. With regard to carrying out commercial prospecting operations for the benefit of advertising clients, the Restricted Committee notes that CALOGA offers a service for sending prospecting emails at the request of agencies or affiliate platforms that provide CALOGA with prospecting kits on behalf of end advertisers. 17. It is apparent from the evidence in the case file that, in practice, these electronic sales prospecting operations are carried out using data from one of CALOGA's databases, determined based on the desired volume, which the company itself created from prospect data transmitted by its primary collection partners. In such a situation, CALOGA's customers not only do not provide the data used, but also do not have access to it. 18. It thus appears that, with regard to sales prospecting operations on behalf of advertisers, the company acts at least in part as the data controller when these operations are carried out using its databases. In this regard, it should be noted that the company confirmed its status as the data controller, first during the on-site inspection carried out in May 2022, and then during its observations with the rapporteur. Furthermore, and without it being necessary in this case to rule on the possible joint liability of its clients, the Restricted Committee notes that CALOGA's liability does not exclude that of the advertisers, who act as joint controllers. It is also possible that in certain cases, CALOGA acts as a processor for its clients, but these hypotheses are not at issue in this case. 19. In view of all of the above, the Restricted Committee wishes to clarify that this decision concerns the processing for which CALOGA is, and acknowledges itself to be, the controller, and which involves the conduct of electronic prospecting operations from its databases for the benefit of advertising clients. 20. Regarding the transmission of prospect data for the purposes of commercial prospecting by electronic means, the restricted committee notes that the company regularly transmits (once a month) the data of active prospects present in its databases, which it has created, to partners, mainly the companies \[…\], so that they can in turn carry out commercial prospecting operations by electronic means on behalf of their own advertising clients. This transmission is carried out by delivering to the partner one or more databases of the company CALOGA, the partner having the choice of the database or databases that it wishes to receive. This delivery is carried out by downloading a secure file which cancels and replaces the previous one. The companies to which the data are transmitted, such as \[…\] or \[…\], then carry out new commercial prospecting operations, in particular by electronic means, on behalf of their advertising clients from the databases whose segments they have targeted with their own tools to which they wish to solicit. These operations constitute new processing of personal data, implemented by data controllers other than CALOGA. 21. Under these conditions, the Restricted Committee considers that the company must be considered the data controller, both for the electronic sales prospecting operations carried out for the benefit of its customers using its database—notwithstanding the potential joint liability of said customers and excluding cases where it acts solely as a processor—and for the transmission of prospect data to partners so that they can carry out electronic sales prospecting themselves. B. On the regularity of the proceedings brought against the company 22. The company asserts that it cannot be criticized for failing to verify the compliance of consent collection based on requirements that did not exist at the time of the inspections. Such a practice would clearly violate the principles of the legality of offenses and penalties and of non-retroactivity. 23. The Restricted Committee wishes to clarify that the applicable legal framework will be examined, within the framework of this deliberation, for each of the breaches identified. It nevertheless reiterates that the decisions referred to by the company as being subsequent to the inspection operations constitute only the application of pre-existing rules and cannot, under these conditions, be subject to the principle of non-retroactivity of repressive rules, which only applies to mandatory rules. 24. It also underlines that, while the CNIL has the power to publish guidelines, recommendations or reference documents intended to facilitate compliance of the processing of personal data with the texts relating to the protection of personal data (pursuant to Article 8, paragraph 2, b) of the Data Protection Act), the legal rules are set by French and European legislators and interpreted by the competent courts, and are directly applicable to the organizations concerned. Therefore, the adoption by the CNIL of reference documents or guidelines is not a prerequisite for the obligation to comply with the rules already laid down and for the application of sanctions provided for by the GDPR or the Data Protection Act in the event of a violation. The Restricted Committee also notes that in this case, the established rules regarding commercial prospecting, informed by CNIL publications such as its framework relating to the processing of personal data implemented for the purpose of managing commercial activities adopted in September 2021 and the pages dedicated to the issue on its website, as well as by Guidelines 5/2020 on consent within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 adopted by the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter, the EDPB), allowed the parties involved to understand, with sufficient precision, the applicable legal framework and the obligations incumbent upon them. 25. Finally, the Restricted Committee wishes to emphasize that it follows from the principle of accountability, as defined by the GDPR, that it is up to the organization carrying out the processing to define and implement the measures enabling compliance with the applicable legal provisions. In this regard, Recital 74 of the GDPR provides that the controller should be held accountable for any processing of personal data that it carries out itself or on its behalf. In particular, it is important that the controller is required to implement appropriate and effective measures and be able to demonstrate compliance of processing activities with this Regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. These measures should take into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risk that it presents for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. It therefore appears that it is up to the controllers – and not the data protection authorities – to determine the practical arrangements for implementing the processing that they consider most appropriate, provided that these arrangements enable them to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down by national and European texts. C. On the failure to comply with the obligation to obtain the consent of the data subjects for the implementation of commercial prospecting by electronic means pursuant to Article L. 34-5 of the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code 26. As a preliminary point, the Restricted Committee notes that the company conducts commercial prospecting operations by email using prospect data transmitted by its partners. The life cycle of this data can be summarized as follows: the data is collected from the data subjects by companies such as \[…\] and \[…\] (referred to as first-time collectors), contractually responsible for obtaining the consent of the data subjects to be the subject of commercial prospecting by electronic means. The collection of this data and the gathering of consent are carried out through entry forms for online competitions designed by these companies. This data is then transmitted to CALOGA, which integrates it into one or more of its databases and then uses it to carry out commercial prospecting operations by electronic means. To do this, it relies on the consent previously collected by its primary collection partners, on its behalf, using the aforementioned forms. 27. In law, pursuant to Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, direct canvassing by means of an automated electronic communications system \[…\], a fax machine, or emails using the contact details of a natural person, subscriber, or user, who has not previously expressed their consent to receive direct canvassing by this means is prohibited. / For the purposes of this article, consent means any freely given, specific, and informed expression of will by which a person agrees to the use of their personal data for the purpose of direct canvassing. / Direct canvassing constitutes the sending of any message intended to promote, directly or indirectly, goods, services, or the image of a person selling goods or providing services. For the purposes of this article, calls and messages intended to encourage users or subscribers to call a premium-rate number or send a premium-rate text message also fall under direct marketing. 28. Under Article 4(11) of the GDPR, consent of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which they, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to them. 29. The rapporteur notes that CALOGA conducts commercial prospecting operations electronically using prospect data collected through competitions, product testing offers, and surveys by companies that collect data first. The data collection forms implemented by the primary data collectors do not allow for the collection of valid consent from the data subjects, and the measures implemented by the company to ensure that the consent collected complies with GDPR requirements are insufficient. 30. In its defense, the company asserts that it could not have foreseen the CNIL's position on the unsatisfactory design of the data collection forms in the absence of a specific recommendation relating to commercial prospecting, as the cookie recommendation does not fall within the same sector of activity. It specifies that the decisions cited by the rapporteur in support of her argument postdate the audit operations. 31. It adds that it has no discretion regarding the publication of the consent collection materials issued by the primary data collectors and that it has implemented measures to verify the compliance of the processing for which it is responsible: contractual frameworks and verifications of the data collected. 1. On the applicable legal framework and the liability of CALOGA 1.1 On the conditions for the validity of consent 32. The company considers that at the time of the audit, in May 2022, the applicable legal framework did not allow it to conclude that the consent collection mechanisms implemented by its partners were invalid. It maintains that it was only through a deliberation of December 29, 2023 (CNIL, FR, December 29, 2023, Sanction, No. 2023-025, published) that the restricted committee ruled on the specific methods of this collection in the context of competitions organized by first-time collectors, and that it was not in a position to anticipate such a decision. It also argues that the recommendations and guidelines relating to cookies, cited in the report, cannot be applied to commercial prospecting. 33. The Restricted Committee recalls that all the rules applicable to electronic prospecting, as well as those relating to consent, have been established for many years and predate not only the publication of the aforementioned decision, but also the inspection operations carried out in May 2022 at CALOGA. 34. The Restricted Committee thus recalls that the specific consent required by the provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, combined with those of Article 4 of the GDPR, must be understood as a free, specific, informed, and unequivocal expression of will and can only result from the express consent of the user, given with full knowledge of the facts after adequate information on the use to which their personal data will be put. 35. It notes that the Court of Justice of the European Union clarified, in its 2019 Planet49 GmbH decision, which concerned the validity of consent given in the context of participation in an online competition, that: Article 7(a) of Directive 95 provides that the consent of the data subject may render such processing lawful provided that that consent is unambiguously given by the data subject. However, only active conduct on the part of that person with a view to manifesting consent is capable of satisfying this requirement (CJEU, Grand Chamber, 1 October 2019, Planet49 GmbH, C-673/17, ECLI:EU:C:2019:801, paragraph 54). Therefore, it must be considered that if consent is not unambiguously given, it must be considered as lacking, which renders the processing unlawful for lack of a legal basis. More specifically, regarding the collection procedures, the CJEU states that the expression of will referred to in Article 2(h) of Directive 95/46 must, in particular, be specific, in the sense that it must relate precisely to the data processing in question and cannot be inferred from an expression of will having a distinct purpose. In this case, contrary to Planet49's argument, the fact that a user activates the participation button in the promotional game organized by that company cannot therefore be considered sufficient to consider that the user has validly given their consent to the placement of cookies (Ibid., paragraphs 58-59). 36. Furthermore, the Council of State held that free, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent can only be the user's express consent, given in full knowledge of the facts and after adequate information on the use that will be made of their personal data. (EC, 10th and 9th Chambers Jointly, June 19, 2020, Google LLC, No. 430810, pt. 21). 37. The Restricted Committee also notes, by way of illustration, that as early as 2017, the Article 29 Working Party (now the European Data Protection Board, hereinafter the EDPB) published guidelines on consent aimed at clarifying the new provisions introduced by the GDPR. New Guidelines 5/2020 on consent were adopted on May 4, 2020, and specify that the free nature of consent implies choice and real control for data subjects. As a general rule, the GDPR provides that if the data subject is not genuinely able to exercise a choice, feels coerced into consenting, or will suffer significant negative consequences if they do not consent, consent is not valid. \[…\] In general terms, any inappropriate pressure or influence exerted on the data subject (which may manifest itself in various ways) preventing them from exercising their will will render consent invalid. 38. Finally, the Restricted Committee emphasizes that the work conducted by the Commission on cookie practices in relation to consent collection banners can usefully be used to assess more generally the conditions for obtaining free, unambiguous, specific, and informed consent, and serve as a reference in commercial prospecting when it is based on consent collection. It should be noted that the general rules relating to the conditions for the validity of consent, drawn in particular from Article 4 of the GDPR, are not intended to differ depending on the sector concerned, and that the CNIL is not required to issue sector-specific recommendations. In this regard, Resolution No. 2020-091 of September 17, 2020, adopting guidelines relating to cookies and other trackers, expressly reiterates that the consent required by Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act refers to the definition and conditions set out in Articles 4.11 and 7 of the GDPR (§§ 5 and 6). 39. Thus, by way of illustration and comparison, the restricted committee notes that in its deliberation No. 2020-092 of September 17, 2020 adopting a recommendation proposing practical methods of compliance in the event of the use of cookies and other trackers, the Commission recommends that the organizations concerned ensure that users take full advantage of the options available to them, in particular through the design chosen and the information provided (§ 10) \[…\] In order not to mislead users, the Commission recommends that data controllers ensure that the interfaces for collecting choices do not include potentially misleading design practices that lead users to believe that their consent is mandatory or that visually highlight one choice more than another. It is recommended to use buttons and a font of the same size, offering the same ease of reading, and highlighted in an identical manner (§ 34). It adds that care should be taken to ensure that the information accompanying each actionable element allowing consent or refusal to be expressed is easily understandable and does not require concentration or interpretation efforts on the part of the user. Thus, it is particularly recommended to ensure that it is not written in such a way that a quick or inattentive reading could lead to the belief that the selected option produces the opposite of what users thought they were choosing. (§ 23). Otherwise, the unequivocal nature of the consent would not be established.40. The Restricted Committee also notes that studies conducted on digital interface practices, particularly regarding cookies, highlight the considerable impact of the appearance of consent banners on user choice, potentially encouraging them to make choices that do not reflect their preferences regarding data sharing. 41. Furthermore, contrary to the company's claims, the Restricted Committee notes that the sanction decision of December 29, 2023 (CNIL, FR, December 29, 2023, SAN-2023-025, published) is based on all of the above-mentioned elements, without imposing any new requirements. It merely applies pre-existing rules that the company was perfectly capable of understanding. 42. It is therefore clear from all of these elements that the rules relating to the consent of data subjects predate the inspections carried out against CALOGA and that they appeared sufficiently clear and precise to enable the company to assess the validity of the consent collected by its partners, on which it relies to carry out its prospecting operations. 1.2 On the obligations imposed on CALOGA 43. The company criticizes the rapporteur for seeking to establish a system of joint and several liability, not provided for in the legislation, between it and its primary collection partners. It considers that its liability should not be assessed in light of the legality of the consent collection mechanisms implemented by its partners—the latter having sole control over the collection media they publish—but in light of the obligations incumbent upon it, itself, at the time of the findings. 44. In this regard, it maintains that the legal framework applicable at the time of the audit did not allow digital marketing players to make the obligations imposed on each of them predictable, since the requirement to carry out verifications of the conditions for obtaining consent from data recipients was only imposed, according to the company, in the decisions rendered by the Restricted Committee after the audits. 45. In any event, the company considers that it has implemented the necessary measures to ensure that it has valid consent, in accordance with the rules and recommendations applicable at the time of the audit. In this regard, it emphasizes that it has, on the one hand, regulated its contractual relationships with its primary data collection partners and, on the other hand, carried out verifications on the forms used. 46. The Restricted Committee notes that the data brokerage sector is characterized by the existence of a processing chain involving several parties, starting with the collection of data by the initial data collectors, followed by their transmission to one or more partners to enable the latter to carry out commercial prospecting operations. In this context, each of the organizations involved must, according to its own responsibility, ensure the lawfulness of the operations in which it participates in this processing chain. 47. The Restricted Committee recalls that, pursuant to the combined provisions of Articles L. 34-5 of the CPCE and Article 4 of the GDPR, this lawfulness requires that the data controller who intends to carry out or arrange for commercial prospecting operations to be carried out electronically obtain the unambiguous, specific, freely given, and informed consent of the data subjects. 48. When prospect data has not been collected directly from them by the data controller, this consent may have been obtained at the time of initial data collection by the initial data collector, on behalf of the data controller. Failing this, it is the data controller's responsibility to collect or arrange for the collection of such consent before carrying out any prospecting activities (CNIL, FR, 24 November 2022, Sanction No. SAN-2022-021, published; Deliberation No. 2021-131 of 23 September 2021 adopting a standard for the processing of personal data implemented for the purpose of managing commercial activities). 49. In this regard, the Restricted Committee upheld the liability of an organization, considering that a simple contractual commitment by the organization providing the data to comply with the GDPR and the applicable rules on commercial prospecting did not constitute a sufficient measure (CNIL, FR, November 24, 2022, Sanction No. SAN-2022-021, published; CNIL, FR, January 31, 2024, Sanction No. SAN-2024-003, published; CNIL, FR, April 4, 2024, Sanction No. SAN-2024-004, published). 50. The Restricted Committee emphasizes that, like the rules governing the conditions for the validity of consent, these requirements are not new and that they derive from the texts to which any organization that intends to carry out commercial prospecting operations electronically is subject in its capacity as data controller. 51. In this case, it is indeed CALOGA, as the data controller of the database used for prospecting, and as the data controller downstream of direct electronic prospecting operations, that is subject to the provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE (and not the primary collectors, who do not directly prospect data subjects), which has clearly required, since the transposition into French law of the ePrivacy Directive in 2004, to obtain the consent of data subjects. It is therefore its responsibility, in this regard, to guarantee the lawfulness of these operations by ensuring the validity of the consent it intends to rely on or, failing that, by obtaining said consent itself. It should be noted that Article 7 of the GDPR provides in this regard that in cases where processing is based on consent, the data controller is able to demonstrate that the data subject has given their consent to the processing of their personal data. 52. Furthermore, the Restricted Committee recalls that, regardless of the body responsible for collecting the consent of data subjects, the validity of that consent – and therefore the lawfulness of processing based on such consent – can only be assessed at the time it is collected, which, in this case, requires examining the collection forms implemented by the company's partners. 53. Thus, to the extent that CALOGA has chosen not to collect this consent itself and to rely on that collected by its partners, ensuring the validity of said consent necessarily requires reviewing the collection mechanisms implemented by the primary data collectors. 2. On the characterization of the breach 54. The Restricted Committee notes that, to create its VOZEKO, ZEPLAN, BASYLO, and CALOGA databases, the company collects the email addresses of prospects from primary collection partners - the companies \[…\] - who collect them by organizing contests, product testing offers, surveys, etc. 55. It notes that, in the privacy policies accessible via the websites published by CALOGA for each of its databases, it is specified that the prospects' data was transmitted to it following participation in a contest or any other data collection operation on a website published by a third-party company, mentioning the VOZEKO, ZEPLAN, BASYLO, and CALOGA databases in its capacity as partner/sponsor of the operation, the legal basis for processing this data being consent. 56. The Restricted Committee also notes that the investigation established that in 2022, CALOGA prospected 2,315,189 people for the company \[…\] (based on 2,287 forms), 1,970,942 people for the company \[…\] (based on 2,259 forms), and 2,050,706 people for the company \[…\] (based on 2,255 forms). The data on these prospects was collected through forms primarily published by the companies \[…\] and \[…\]. 57. Among the 3,653 forms submitted by the company, some of which have identical appearances, the Restricted Committee notes that at least 21 of them offer the user a button validating both their participation in the competition and the use of their data to receive offers from partners of the company organizing the competition. 58. After completing their contact information, the user has the choice between clicking on a button I PARTICIPATE or I VALIDATE (which may also be titled CONTINUE, VALIDATE MY PARTICIPATION), located at the bottom of the form and allowing them to both validate their participation in the competition and consent to their data being transmitted to partners and used by them for commercial prospecting purposes, or clicking on a link allowing them to participate only in the competition, refusing the transmission and use of their data for commercial prospecting purposes (a link which may be contained in the sentence to participate without receiving offers from sponsors, click here, or To participate without receiving offers from sponsors and their partners, click here. 59. The Restricted Committee considers that, as designed, the proposed forms do not allow data subjects to validly express a choice reflecting their preferences regarding the transmission and use of their data for commercial prospecting purposes. Indeed, the overall overview of the interfaces particularly highlights the CONTINUE or VALIDATE buttons, which, by their size—significantly larger than the rest of the information—and their color—which contrasts with the background used—stand out from the other information provided. Similarly, their title suggests more the conclusion of the user journey than the use of data for commercial prospecting purposes, since, in everyday language, one validates the information entered in a form and authorizes, one accepts the use of data. Finally, their placement gives the impression that they must be clicked to complete registration and participate in the competition. Conversely, the hyperlink allowing participation in the competition without accepting the use of its data by partners is presented in the body of the text located above or below the acceptance buttons, in characters of a size significantly smaller than that used for the buttons and without particular emphasis, so that it does not appear intuitive that it is possible to participate without clicking on one of the aforementioned buttons and therefore without transmitting its data to third parties for prospecting purposes. The consent collected is, under these conditions, devoid of unequivocal and free character.60. The Restricted Committee considers that the user is not in a position to give their consent in a fully informed, free, and unequivocal manner, after receiving adequate information about the use of their data. The misleading appearance of the forms encourages them to give their consent to the use of their data for prospecting purposes. 61. Furthermore, the Restricted Committee reiterates that, while the design of these forms is not attributable to it, the company should have, as indicated in points 46 to 50 of this deliberation, ensured the validity of the consent it intends to rely on to carry out its prospecting operations. 62. The Restricted Committee notes that the company implemented verification measures in 2014 and then updated these measures in 2018 with the entry into force of the GDPR. At the date of the inspections, these verification measures related to a contractual commitment from the first-time collectors to require that valid consent be obtained to allow the transmission of data. Before each contract was signed, the company carried out an audit of the first-time collector's practices. During the contract, the company verified the compliance of the collection operations organized by the first-time collectors, i.e., the information notices, the type of data collected, the presence of a link to participate without consenting to the prospecting purposes and the presence of the name of the brand associated with a database in the list of recipients. The company indicated, however, that, as part of the control procedure, for certain first-time collector partners, the checks are carried out at the conclusion of the partnership and that all operations are validated by default, the company not carrying out checks on all forms, which it confirms in its documents. This is particularly the case for the partner \[…\], which transmits the largest amount of prospect data to the company. 63. The Restricted Committee notes in this regard that the company indicated, firstly, that it had stipulated in its contractual relations with its primary data collection partners that the latter undertook to validly collect the consent of the data subjects and, secondly, that it had implemented certain procedures for verifying the collection forms since 2018. Regarding the contractual framework, the Restricted Committee notes that the clauses contained in the contracts entered into with its partners appear very general – the latter undertaking to validly collect the consent of the data subjects, to document said consent, and to transmit a record thereof to CALOGA. The company receiving the data cannot be satisfied with this and must carry out specific verifications of the conditions for collecting the consent on which it intends to rely to carry out its prospecting operations. In this regard, the Restricted Committee notes that the company did indeed regularly review the data collection forms implemented by its partners. However, the findings show that the checks were not carried out with sufficient frequency given the number of data collection forms used and, in any event, that the company did not draw the necessary conclusions regarding the invalidity of the consent obtained and continued to use the data transmitted to carry out its commercial prospecting operations. Indeed, it appears that, based on the documents in the file, the forms analyzed as part of the audit procedure did not allow valid consent to be obtained from the data subjects, even though the checks carried out by the company had begun several months earlier. 64. It follows from the above that, as the company failed to obtain valid consent from the data subjects to create a contact database for commercial prospecting purposes and use it, with regard to the contact details collected by the companies \[…\] and \[…\], CALOGA committed a breach of the provisions of Article L.34-5 of the CPCE. D. On the failure to respect the right to withdraw consent pursuant to Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE 65. In law, Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, which transposes the ePrivacy Directive, which refers to the concept of consent within the meaning of Article 4 paragraph 11 of the GDPR, provides that direct marketing by means of an automated electronic communications system \[…\], fax, or email using the contact details of a natural person \[…\] who has not previously expressed their consent to receive direct marketing by this means, is prohibited. For the purposes of this article, consent means any freely given, specific, and informed expression of will by which a person agrees to the use of personal data concerning them for the purpose of direct marketing \[…\]. Furthermore, pursuant to paragraph 5 of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, it is prohibited in all cases to send messages for the purpose of direct marketing by means of an automated electronic communications system within the meaning of paragraph 6 of Article L. 32, fax machines, and emails, without providing valid contact information to which the recipient may usefully send a request to cease such communications without incurring any costs other than those associated with the transmission thereof. 66. Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE therefore makes direct marketing operations conditional on the recipient's consent and, correspondingly, provides the data subject with the right to withdraw their consent by submitting a request to cease marketing communications. The data subject may thus reverse their decision to accept the conduct of marketing operations. 67. The withdrawal of consent by prospects for electronic marketing and its procedures are analyzed in light of the provisions of Article 7, paragraph 3, of the GDPR, which applies to the provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, insofar as the ePrivacy Directive provides in Article 2 (f) that the consent of a user or subscriber corresponds to the consent of the data subject as set out in Directive 95/46/EC, which was replaced by the GDPR. To this end, Guidelines No. 5/2020 on consent under the GDPR, adopted on May 4, 2020 by the EDPB, may provide inspiration. 68. According to Article 7(3) of the GDPR, the data subject has the right to withdraw their consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent given before its withdrawal. The data subject is informed of this before giving their consent. Withdrawing consent is as simple as giving consent. 69. In its Guidelines No. 5/2020 on consent under the GDPR, adopted on May 4, 2020, the EDPB states that: The data subject should also be able to withdraw their consent without prejudice. This means, among other things, that a controller must offer the possibility to withdraw consent free of charge or without resulting in a reduction in the level of service (point 114). This provision should be read in light of recital 42 of this Regulation, which provides that: consent should not be considered freely given if the data subject does not have genuine freedom of choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw their consent without prejudice. 70. The rapporteur notes that prospects can give their consent to receive offers from CALOGA partners, via the collection forms, with a single click. Their data is then stored in CALOGA's various databases. While users can unsubscribe upon receiving an email by clicking on the unsubscribe link, this unsubscription will only apply to the database from which the email was sent or to an end advertiser on whose behalf the email was sent. To unsubscribe from offers sent by CALOGA in full, it is necessary to send an email to CALOGA. The rapporteur considers that withdrawing consent is not as simple as giving it, since it is not possible to withdraw consent to receive offers from all of CALOGA's databases with a single click, whereas prospects give their consent with a single click to receive all partner offers sent by CALOGA. 71. The company states that links inserted in prospecting emails allow unsubscribers to no longer receive advertising content from a specific advertiser or database. It specifies that it is possible to request withdrawal of consent for all databases via the address dpo@caloga.com. 72. Furthermore, the company questions the existence of an absolute right to withdraw consent when consent can be given, with a single click, to a multitude of partners. It therefore questions the obligation imposed on all of these partners to take into account the withdrawal of consent and affirms that it has complied with the CNIL's recommendations published on its website regarding the transmission of data to partners. 73. In this case, the Restricted Committee notes that the company organizes its processing around four databases: CALOGA, ZEPLAN, BASYLO, and VOZEKO, each of which contains more than one million entries, with duplicates. When prospects give their consent with a single click to the collection of their data for prospecting purposes, this data may be sent to one or two of CALOGA's databases. These databases are presented as different partners in the lists of partners on the collection forms implemented by the initial data collectors.74. The Restricted Committee notes that, in prospecting emails sent on behalf of advertisers, two links are inserted. The first link allows the prospect to unsubscribe from receiving advertising content from a specific end advertiser, regardless of the database used. A second link allows the prospect to unsubscribe from receiving advertising content from partners of a CALOGA brand, i.e., from one of its databases. Thus, if the prospect has registered in another of the company's databases, named differently under a different brand, they will continue to receive offers sent from that other database even if they have used the second link to unsubscribe from the offers received. The Restricted Committee also notes that, for a prospect's withdrawal of consent to be taken into account for all databases managed by CALOGA (i.e., for all brands, according to the terminology used by the company), the prospect cannot express this request via a link contained in a single prospecting email, but must send an explicit request to the company's DPO by email or click on several unsubscribe links included in separate emails. 75. A prospect can therefore be registered in one or two databases with a single click. However, when they wish to withdraw their consent to receive offers from advertisers sent by CALOGA and from the two databases to which they are registered, they must make a specific unsubscribe request for all of the company's databases in which they are registered, which requires several steps and clicks on different unsubscribe links contained in separate prospecting emails or sending an email to a dedicated address. 76. The Restricted Committee therefore notes that, in the system implemented by CALOGA, it is not possible for the prospect to unsubscribe with a single click from the CALOGA databases to which they have subscribed. However, it notes that if the prospect is only registered in a single CALOGA database, the prospect will only need a single click to withdraw their consent. The Restricted Committee considers that, when a prospect is registered in two of the company's databases with a single click at the time of collection, they should be able to withdraw their consent for both databases with a single click from a URL link in the prospecting email. Clicking on this link would therefore have the same consequences as sending an email to the company to unsubscribe from the CALOGA databases to which they have subscribed. 77. With regard more specifically to the rules published on the CNIL website in a practical sheet relating to the transmission of data to partners, the restricted committee notes that they do indeed indicate that it is possible for a first-time collector who transmits data to partners to collect the consent of a prospect, at the time of collecting their data, in a single click on behalf of several partners - who will be recipients of the data and responsible for processing their prospecting operations - as long as they are identified. However, contrary to the company's analysis, this publication does not refer to the methods for withdrawing the consent of the interested parties and therefore does not include any information on this point, contrary to the provisions of Article 7 of the GDPR, which provides that it must be as simple to withdraw consent as to give it. On this basis, the Restricted Committee considers that by giving consent with one click to be included in two CALOGA databases, the prospect must therefore be able to withdraw their consent from these two databases with one click, especially since the databases are managed by the same data controller. 78. In addition to this general issue, the Restricted Committee also notes that CALOGA has named one of its four databases (or brands) CALOGA (the names of the other databases/brands being ZEPLAN, BASYLO, and VOZEKO). The Restricted Committee emphasizes that this system implemented by the company is confusing since the prospect may legitimately believe, by clicking on the unsubscribe link titled ""no longer receive any offers from CALOGA advertisers,"" that the action applies to all of the company's databases. Indeed, it is highly misleading, from the prospect's perspective, that CALOGA has given its name to one of the databases. A prospect who, at the time of data collection, checks the list of partners, will see the name Caloga displayed as a trademark and not as a company. They will not notice that CALOGA owns other trademarks, and therefore other databases, which appear under a different name in the list of partners. 79. It is clear from these elements that there is real harm to prospects who believe they have withdrawn their consent. Despite a positive action on their part requesting the withdrawal of their consent, they will continue to receive prospecting emails in a context of intense solicitation linked to the very nature of the electronic prospecting market. 80. In this regard, and in light of all of the above, the Restricted Committee considers that the company cannot rely on its internal organizational choices, by opting to distribute the collected data across different databases corresponding to different brands, to avoid its obligations, as its organizational choices must not prevent the withdrawal of consent under the same conditions as those under which it was obtained. 81. Therefore, by not offering data subjects the option of withdrawing their consent with a single click from the databases to which they have subscribed with a single click, the company has committed a breach of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE (French Data Protection Regulation) as clarified by Article 7, paragraph 3 of the GDPR. E. On the failure to comply with the obligation to have a legal basis for transmitting prospect data for the purposes of commercial prospecting by electronic means pursuant to Article 6 of the GDPR 82. Article 6(1) of the GDPR provides that processing is lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following conditions is met: a) the data subject has consented to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes; b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract; c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; d) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. 83. Pursuant to Article 4(11) of the GDPR, consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. 84. Regarding the quality of consent collection, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) clarified in its Planet49 GmbH decision: Article 7(a) of Directive 95 provides that the consent of the data subject may render such processing lawful provided that that consent is unambiguously given by the data subject. However, only active conduct on the part of that person with a view to manifesting consent is capable of satisfying this requirement (CJEU, Grand Chamber, 1 October 2019, Planet49 GmbH, C-673/17, §54). 85. If consent is not unambiguously given, it must be considered lacking, which renders the processing unlawful for lack of a legal basis. 86. Regarding the methods for obtaining consent, the CJEU states that the expression of will referred to in Article 2(h) of Directive 95/46 must, in particular, be specific, in the sense that it must relate precisely to the data processing in question and cannot be inferred from an expression of will having a distinct purpose. In this case, contrary to what Planet49 argued, the fact that a user activates the participation button in the promotional game organized by that company cannot therefore be considered sufficient to consider that the user has validly given their consent to the placement of cookies (ibid., §§ 58-59). 87. Furthermore, regarding the quality of the information provided when obtaining consent, the CJEU stated that clear and complete information must enable the user to easily determine the consequences of the consent they may give and ensure that this consent is given with full knowledge of the facts. It must be clearly understandable and sufficiently detailed to enable the user to understand how the cookies used work (idem, §74).88. The Council of State, for its part, held that free, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent can only be the express consent of the user, given with full knowledge of the facts and after adequate information on the use to which their personal data will be put. \[…\] Finally, regardless of the method by which it is obtained, consent is only valid if it is preceded by a clear and distinct presentation of all the purposes pursued by the processing (EC, 10th and 9th Joint Chambers, June 19, 2020, Google LLC, No. 430810, pt. 21). 89. Finally, in its framework relating to the processing of personal data implemented for the purpose of managing commercial activities, the CNIL considers that if the purpose of the transmission is to enable commercial partners to carry out prospecting requiring the prior consent of the data subjects (electronic prospecting): o given that commercial prospecting by electronic means presents specific risks (particularly due to the volume of requests likely to be received due to its automation), the organization transmitting the data must inform the data subjects, on the data collection medium (online form or paper form), and obtain their consent to this transmission; o the organization transmitting the data must, beforehand, have allowed the data subjects to assess the consequences of their choice regarding the transmission by informing them of the scope of the transmission. Informing the data subjects of the number and sector of activity of the partners who would be recipients of the data is an example of a measure that helps to respect the reasonable expectations of the data subjects in this regard; o Before conducting electronic prospecting, the partners who are recipients of the data must prove that they also have the consent of the individuals who will be contacted. \[…\] The CNIL has indeed considered that there must be a parallel between the transmission of data to third parties to create databases for electronic marketing purposes and the regime governing this transmission, implying that this transmission is carried out on the basis of consent (opt-in), whereas, when the marketing is based on a legitimate interest regime with opposition (opt-out), the transmission of data to third parties does not require consent (but the individual must be informed, along with the categories of recipients) and be able to object (CNIL, P, December 1, 2021, Formal Notice, Company X, No. MED-2021-131, unpublished). 90. The rapporteur asserts that, contrary to the company's analysis, the partners to whom it transmits prospect data for electronic sales prospecting purposes do not act as subcontractors on behalf of CALOGA and that the company should therefore have obtained the prospects' consent to transmit their data to commercial partners for electronic sales prospecting purposes. However, since the consent obtained at the time the prospect data was collected was not valid, the company could not transmit this data to its partners. 91. The company disputes the status of data controller of its recipient partners and considers them, based on a factual analysis, to be subcontractors. As such, it considers that it is not required to obtain specific consent for the transmission of data. 92. It asserts that, in the absence of recommendations from the CNIL, it cannot be criticized for failing to anticipate the CNIL's requirements regarding the status of the partners receiving the data and therefore the obligation to obtain specific consent for the transmission of prospect data to its partners. 93. The Restricted Committee notes that in this case, as part of its data brokerage activity, the company builds its prospect databases with primary collection partners (the companies \[…\], in particular) and then transmits them to other partners who carry out electronic prospecting activities for the benefit of end advertisers. The main partners to whom this data is transmitted are the companies \[…\] (1.9 million prospect data items transmitted during the last transmission in February 2023) and \[…\] (2.2 million prospect data items transmitted during the last transmission in May 2023). 94. As detailed in its previous arguments (points 17 and 18), the Restricted Committee notes that CALOGA transmits data to its partners so that commercial prospecting operations can be carried out electronically on behalf of their advertising clients using databases from which its partners have targeted, using their own tools, the segments they wish to contact. The administration of these databases and the operations constitute new processing of personal data, implemented by data controllers other than CALOGA. In this context, the Restricted Committee considers that CALOGA must be considered as the controller of the transmission of prospect data to partners so that commercial prospecting operations can be carried out electronically by the latter on behalf of third parties. However, to be lawful, as emphasized in the CNIL's framework for the processing of personal data implemented for the purpose of managing commercial activities, when the purpose of data transmission is to enable business partners to conduct prospecting requiring the prior consent of the data subjects (electronic prospecting), the organization transmitting the data must obtain the consent of the data subjects for this transmission of their data. Indeed, since the data is transmitted solely for operations for which the law, due to its particular intrusiveness, requires consent, the CNIL considers that the legal basis of legitimate interest cannot be upheld. Thus, in the specific ecosystem of data brokers where the transmission of prospect data is intended for electronic prospecting operations, prospecting based on the legal basis of consent, all processing involving the transmission of personal data for this purpose must also be based on the legal basis of consent. 95. However, CALOGA does not have valid consent to transmit prospect data to its partners for electronic sales prospecting purposes on behalf of their advertising clients. The company considers that it is not required to obtain specific consent for this transmission, as it falls within its legitimate interest. 96. By not having the consent of the data subjects for this transmission of their data, and thus a valid legal basis for implementing this processing, the company has committed a breach of Article 6 of the GDPR. F. On the failure to comply with the obligation to retain data for a period not exceeding that necessary for the purposes for which they are processed, pursuant to Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR 97. Pursuant to Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, personal data must be retained in a form that permits identification of the data subjects for a period not exceeding that necessary for the purposes for which they are processed (…). 98. Pursuant to these provisions, it is the responsibility of the data controller to define a retention period consistent with the purpose of the processing. When this purpose is achieved, the data must be deleted or anonymized, or be subject to interim archiving for a specified period when their retention is necessary, for example, to comply with legal obligations or for pre-litigation or litigation purposes, in particular. 99. In this regard, the restricted committee has repeatedly recalled that the retention period for personal data must be determined according to the purpose of the processing. When they are no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were collected, the data must either be deleted or be subject to intermediate archiving when their retention is necessary, for example to comply with legal obligations or for pre-litigation or litigation purposes. This intermediate archiving first requires sorting the relevant data to be archived, based on the purposes justifying its retention (legal or accounting obligations, litigation purposes, etc.), then separating it from the active database, which may be physical—via a transfer of the data to a dedicated archive database—or logical—via the implementation of technical and organizational measures ensuring that only those individuals with an interest in processing the data due to their duties can access it (CNIL, FR, September 8, 2022, Sanction, No. SAN-2022-018, published; CNIL, FR, December 29, 2023, Sanction, No. SAN-2023-023, published). 100. Regarding the starting point of the period, the restricted committee also considered that a data controller \[could not\], without disregarding the principle of limiting the duration of data retention, consider that the simple opening of a prospecting email by a person allows the starting point of the retention period for prospects’ data to start again and thus retain such data even though the prospects have not demonstrated, by a clear act, an interest in the company’s products or services for several years (CNIL, FR, 28 July 2020, sanction deliberation no. SAN-2020-003; CNIL, FR, deliberation SAN-2020-016 of 7 December 2020). This position reflects the doctrine of the CNIL which, as early as 2016, in Article 5 of Deliberation No. 2016-264 of 21 July 2016 amending a simplified standard concerning the automated processing of personal data relating to the management of customers and prospects (NS-048), specified that personal data relating to a non-customer prospect may be retained for a period of three years from their collection by the data controller or from the last contact from the prospect (for example, a request for documentation or a click on a hyperlink contained in an email; on the other hand, the opening of an email cannot be considered as a contact from the prospect).101. These elements are now reiterated in the framework relating to the processing of personal data implemented for the purpose of managing commercial activities: Personal data relating to a non-customer prospect may be retained for a period of three years from its collection by the data controller or from the last contact from the prospect (for example, a request for documentation or a click on a hyperlink contained in an email referring to the promoted product; however, simply opening an email should not be considered a contact from the prospect). At the end of this three-year period, the data controller may contact the data subject again to determine whether they wish to continue receiving commercial solicitations. In the absence of a positive and explicit response from the individual, the data should be deleted or archived for a period in accordance with the provisions in force (page 11). 102. The rapporteur first considers that by retaining prospect data for a period of four years, without sorting or archiving the data in the interim, even though these prospects are considered inactive by the company after a period of one year without interaction, the company retained the data for an excessive period. She then considers that taking the opening of an email as the starting point for the period does not comply with the requirements of the GDPR, since this interaction, sometimes involuntary, could allow the company to retain prospect data indefinitely in the absence of any voluntary act by the data subjects expressing a wish to do so. 103. The company states that it has compartmentalized its databases in order to pursue three purposes: exploiting the data of active prospects, identifying prospects who have withdrawn their consent, and retaining the data of inactive prospects for evidentiary purposes. It adds that it implements different retention periods depending on the intended purpose: 12 months from the prospect's last action (opening a prospecting email) for commercial prospecting purposes. After 12 months, the prospect is considered inactive. The data of inactive prospects is retained for four years for evidentiary purposes related to consent. 104. Furthermore, it specifies that these retention periods and the starting point of the period are imposed by the operational constraints of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as well as by the statutes of limitations in criminal matters provided for in Article 133-3 of the Criminal Code. 105. The Restricted Committee notes that CALOGA applies a maximum retention period of twelve months from the last action of the active prospect. The company takes into account the later of the date of collection or expression of consent from the data subject, the date the email was opened, or the date a link within an email was clicked. After these twelve months, and without any interaction from the prospect, the latter is considered inactive. An additional retention period of four years from the date the prospect becomes inactive is then applied by the company for evidentiary purposes relating to the prospects' consent. It notes that the company thus retains more than 13.5 million email addresses corresponding to prospects whose data was collected for more than three years or who became inactive for more than three years. 106. First, the Restricted Committee notes that, to determine the active or inactive status of a prospect, the company took into account the date a sales prospecting email was last opened as the date of the last interaction with the prospect, starting the twelve-month period before the prospect was moved to inactive status. Thus, each time the prospect opens an email from the company – even inadvertently – the company will extend the retention of this prospect’s data in its active databases, potentially without limitation. According to a long-established doctrine, the notion of interaction, as understood by the company, is too broad in that the mere opening of an email does not necessarily reflect a desire to stay in contact with the company that is soliciting the person concerned. Indeed, depending on the email service used, clicking once on a new email may be enough to open it, which may result from a simple browsing accident. Opening an email therefore does not result from the same active action on the part of the person concerned as, for example, clicking on a URL link contained in a prospecting email referring to a particular product or service, or even asking the company to obtain documentation on one of its products or services. 107. Secondly, the Restricted Committee notes that the company's prospect data is acquired for a specific purpose, namely commercial prospecting. While, once this purpose has been achieved, the retention of certain data may be justified in light of other purposes, for example, the purposes of preserving evidence related to prospect consent and ensuring the complete cessation of all commercial solicitation of said prospect, as cited by the company, the Restricted Committee considers, however, that the company must, upon transition to inactive status, carry out a sorting process to delete data that is no longer necessary and retain only that which is necessary for these purposes, by archiving it in an interim manner to limit access to only those persons who have a need to know it due to their duties. The Restricted Committee notes that the company confirmed that it does not carry out any intermediate archiving and that it retains all of its prospects' data in an active database for a period of four years from the moment the prospect is considered inactive, thus not implementing any differentiated access based on the purposes pursued and not sorting or deleting the data in question, such as date of birth, postal code, or postal address. Such a practice does not comply with the principle of limitation set out in Article 5, paragraph 1, e) of the GDPR. 108. In any event, the Restricted Committee considers that the operational constraints imposed by economic actors cannot justify disregarding the requirements arising from the GDPR. 109. Regarding the time limits provided for in criminal proceedings, the Restricted Committee considers that the provisions of the Criminal Code invoked by the company, namely the combination of Articles 226-16 and 133-3 of the Criminal Code, do not apply to the prospecting processing carried out by CALOGA. Indeed, Article 226-16 of the Criminal Code covers the act, including negligence, of processing personal data or causing it to be processed without complying with the formalities required by law prior to its implementation. This only concerns processing requiring formalities prior to processing, such as processing in the health sector, which is not the case here. 110. Consequently, the Restricted Committee notes that the fact that the company considers the opening of an email as an interaction by the prospect to define the starting point of the retention period and keeps its prospects' data in an active database, without sorting, for a period of four years from the date the data becomes inactive, constitutes a breach of the provisions of Article 5, paragraph 1, e) of the GDPR. G. On the failure to comply with the obligation to ensure the security of personal data pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR 111. Article 32(1) of the GDPR provides that, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks, of varying likelihood and severity, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk \[…\], including means to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services, and a procedure for regularly testing, analyzing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of processing. 112. In terms of authentication, it is necessary to ensure that a password used to authenticate on a system cannot be disclosed. Storing passwords securely is a basic precaution in terms of personal data protection. As early as 2013, ANSSI issued warnings and reiterated best practices regarding password storage, stating that they must be stored in a form transformed by a one-way cryptographic function (hash function) that is slow to calculate, such as PBKDF2, and that password transformation must involve a random salt to prevent attacks using precalculated tables. 113. The Commission also specified in its Deliberation No. 2017-012 of January 19, 2017, regarding storage conditions, that passwords must never be stored in plain text. It recommends that it be transformed using a non-reversible and secure cryptographic function (i.e. using a public algorithm known to be strong whose software implementation is free of known vulnerabilities), incorporating the use of a salt or a key. The commission further considers that the salt or key must be generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (i.e. based on a public algorithm known to be strong whose software implementation is free of known vulnerabilities), and not be stored in the same storage space as the password verification element. These requirements were included in deliberation No. 2022-100 of July 21, 2022 adopting a recommendation relating to passwords and other shared secrets, and repealing deliberation No. 2017-012 of January 19, 2017 (see §§ 48 et seq.). Furthermore, the restricted formation has, on several occasions, sanctioned organizations on this point (see in this regard, CNIL, FR, November 24, 2022, n° SAN-2022-021, published and CNIL, FR, October 12, 2023, n° SAN-2023-015).114. The rapporteur considers that the passwords allowing access to the company's back office are stored in a file where they are hashed using the MD5 algorithm, which is considered obsolete. Furthermore, she states that access to the company's databases is via a single user account whose credentials are known to two people. 115. The company considers that there is no evidence to suggest that access to the databases was made possible via the back office. She specifies that the storage of passwords in MD5 applies to individuals with access to the back office. The company considers that, since the back office did not allow access to personal data, Article 32 of the GDPR is not applicable to the present case. 116. Furthermore, it states that the programmatic MySQL account is an account accessible via a username and password, and is intended to be used by all PHP scripts, i.e., lists of commands or instructions using the PHP programming language, requiring access to the database. Access to these usernames is protected, as they are only accessible via a prior login by one of the administrators. It therefore concludes that the measures to ensure traceability of connections to this account are sufficient. 117. First, the Restricted Committee recalls that, with regard to password security, the MD5 hash function has known vulnerabilities that do not guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of passwords in the event of a brute force attack following compromise of the servers hosting them. Given that, generally speaking, a large number of Internet users use the same password to log into their various online accounts, attackers could exploit the compromised data to multiply intrusions into their other accounts, for the purpose of, for example, theft or fraud. The Restricted Committee has already had the opportunity to recall that the company's use of the MD5 hash function has not been considered state-of-the-art since 2004, and its use in cryptography or security is prohibited. Thus, the use of this algorithm would allow a person with knowledge of the hashed password to easily decrypt it in a very short time (for example, using freely accessible websites that allow the value corresponding to the password hash to be retrieved) (Deliberation SAN-2021-008 of June 14, 2021). 118. The Committee considers that the evidence in the case does not establish that the back office allows access to personal data. However, it notes that, assuming that the passwords for accessing the back office and those for accessing the database were stored using the same processes, the MD5 hash algorithm is considered obsolete and would not ensure the security of personal data. 119. Secondly, the Restricted Committee notes that access to the database is via a programmatic account. However, even if the credentials for this account are shared between two individuals, restricting access to the programmatic account to a limited number of IP addresses effectively ensures the traceability of connections. 120. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the breach of Article 32 of the GDPR has not been established. III. ON CORRECTIVE MEASURES AND THEIR PUBLICITY 121. Pursuant to Article 20-IV of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, as amended, when the data controller or its processor fails to comply with the obligations arising from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, or from this Law, the President of the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties may \[…\] refer the matter to the Commission's restricted committee with a view to imposing, after an adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures: \[…\] 7° Except in cases where the processing is carried out by the State, an administrative fine may not exceed €10 million or, in the case of a company, 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover for the previous financial year, whichever is higher. In the cases referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, these ceilings are increased to EUR 20 million and 4% of said turnover, respectively. The Restricted Committee shall take into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same Article 83. 122. Article 83 of the GDPR further provides that each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive, before specifying the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and when deciding the amount of that fine. 123. Finally, Article 22, paragraph 2 of the French Data Protection Act provides that the restricted committee may make public the measures it takes. 124. The rapporteur proposes that the restricted committee impose an administrative fine on the company for its breaches of Articles 5, paragraph 1, e), 6, and 32 of the GDPR and Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE. She proposes that the restricted committee's deliberations be made public. 125. In its defense, the company considers that it has paid particular attention to compliance with the GDPR throughout its operations. It asserts that the breach relating to data security is not a serious one and that, with regard to the other breaches, it cannot be criticized for failing to comply with the new requirements imposed by the CNIL. 126. In the event that the Restricted Committee decides to impose a fine, the company considers that the amount proposed by the rapporteur must be significantly reduced, at a minimum. It specifies that the financial elements to be taken into account when assessing the amount of the fine must be assessed at the time the decision to impose a fine is made and not at the time of the violation. The Restricted Committee must therefore take into account the financial year 2023, given that the turnover for that year amounts to \[…\] euros and a net loss of \[…\] euros. It states that its economic situation forced it to cease trading. For the year 2024, the company achieved a turnover of \[…\] euros and a net loss of \[…\] euros. 127. Finally, the company does not object to the publicity of the penalty. A. On the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount 128. As a preliminary point, the Restricted Committee recalls that the requirement to provide reasons for an administrative penalty does not require the Restricted Committee to rule on all the criteria provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, nor does it imply that the figures relating to the method of determining the amount of the proposed or imposed penalty must be provided (CE, 10th/9th ch., June 19, 2020, No. 430810; CE, 10th/9th ch., May 14, 2024, No. 472221). Furthermore, while the guidelines adopted by the European Data Protection Board aim to establish harmonized starting amounts and common guidelines on the basis of which administrative fines may be calculated, supervisory authorities are under no obligation to follow all the steps if they are not applicable in a given case, nor to provide reasons for those aspects of the guidelines that are not applicable. However, the reasoning should include, at a minimum, the factors that made it possible to determine the degree of seriousness, the turnover applied, and the aggravating or mitigating factors that were taken into consideration. 129. That being said, the Restricted Committee considers that it is appropriate, in this case, to examine the relevant criteria of Article 83 of the GDPR to decide whether to impose an administrative fine on the company and, if so, to determine its amount. 1) On the imposition of the fine 130. First, the Restricted Committee considers that the criterion provided for in Article 83(2)(a) of the GDPR relating to the nature, gravity, and duration of the breach should be applied, taking into account the nature and scope of the processing, the number of data subjects, and the level of damage they have suffered. 131. The Restricted Committee notes, first of all, that breaches of Articles 5(1)(e) and 6 of the GDPR concern the fundamental principles of data protection and are liable to be punished by the highest fine provided for by the European legislature, namely €20 million or, in the case of a company, up to 4% of its turnover. For clarification, the Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines adopted by the Article 29 Working Party (now the EDPB) on 3 October 2017 emphasize that by setting two different maximum amounts for the administrative fine (€10 million and €20 million), the Regulation already indicates that violations of certain provisions of the Regulation may be more serious than violations of other provisions. 132. The Restricted Committee emphasizes that these breaches concern the basic principles of processing and relate in particular to its lawfulness, as some of the commercial prospecting operations carried out occur without a valid legal basis (the company does not have the consent of the data subjects to solicit them electronically and cannot rely on the legal basis of legitimate interest to transmit prospect data to its partners for electronic prospecting purposes). The Restricted Committee also emphasizes the particularly high number of individuals whose data, more than 2.8 million prospects, the company processes.133. With particular regard to the breach of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE (French Data Protection Regulation), the Restricted Committee wishes to emphasize its particular seriousness, as it was found that the forms submitted by the company did not allow for the collection of valid consent from the data subjects. These findings demonstrate the systemic and not isolated nature of the breach, noting that the forms examined came from two of the company's three largest data providers. Furthermore, the Restricted Committee wishes to emphasize the number of data subjects affected by the breach, as the company indicated that it sent 6 million marketing messages electronically during 2022. 134. Secondly, the Restricted Committee considers that the criterion set out in Article 83(2)(b) of the GDPR, relating to whether the breach was committed deliberately or negligently, should be taken into account. 135. As already stated, the Restricted Committee emphasizes that the rules relating to commercial prospecting have been defined for many years and that the company was fully aware that in order to carry out its prospecting operations electronically, it required valid consent. The Restricted Committee notes in this regard that the company implemented procedures in 2014 to conduct audits of its suppliers and verify the validity of the consent obtained. Despite these verifications, the company did not take the necessary measures to ensure its compliance. On the contrary, the company continued to use the data transmitted. The Restricted Committee considers that by failing to comply with these rules, the company was, at the very least, grossly negligent. 136. Third, the Restricted Committee intends to take into account certain other circumstances applicable to the facts of this case, pursuant to Article 83(2)(k) of the GDPR. 137. The Restricted Committee considers, in particular, that the company derived a clear financial advantage from the violations committed, insofar as it was paid by its customers for providing the data in question. 138. The Restricted Committee notes, however, that the company has ceased trading. 139. The Restricted Committee considers that all of these elements justify the imposition of an administrative fine. 2) On the amount of the fine 140. The Restricted Committee recalls that the violations identified are subject, pursuant to Article 83 of the GDPR, to an administrative fine of up to €20 million or up to 4% of the company's worldwide annual turnover for the previous financial year, whichever is higher. 141. It considers that the company's business and financial situation must be taken into account in particular. In this regard, it notes that CALOGA's business has ceased. For the year 2023, the company generated a turnover of \[…\] euros and a net loss of \[…\] euros. For the year 2024, the company generated a turnover of \[…\] euros and a net loss of \[…\] euros. 142. In light of the company's liability, its financial capacity, and the relevant criteria of Article 83, paragraph 2 of the GDPR mentioned above, the Restricted Committee considers that a fine of eighty thousand (80,000) euros appears justified. B. On the publicity of the penalty 143. The Restricted Committee considers that such a measure is justified given the seriousness of the breaches in question, the company's market position, and the number of persons concerned, who must be informed. 144. It also notes that this measure is intended, in particular, to inform the individuals concerned by the processing carried out by the company, as well as partner companies. With regard to prospective customers, this information will enable them, where applicable, to assert their rights. 145. It further considers that this measure appears proportionate since the decision will no longer identify the company by name after a period of two years from its publication. FOR THESE REASONS The CNIL's Restricted Committee, after deliberation, decides to: • impose an administrative fine of eighty thousand (80,000) euros on CALOGA for breaches of Articles 5, paragraph 1, e) and 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 and Article L. 34-5 of the French Post and Electronic Communications Code; • publish its decision on the CNIL website and the Légifrance website, which will no longer allow the company to be identified by name after a period of two years from its publication. President Philippe-Pierre CABOURDIN This decision may be appealed to the Council of State within two months of its notification."

The CNIL decided to carry out checks with the data controller and its subcontractor, which was entrusted with the management of this website. During its investigations, the CNIL found that the website in question had suffered numerous waves of attacks of the credential stuffing type. In this type of attack, a malicious person retrieves lists of identifiers and passwords ""in clear"" published on the Internet, usually following a data breach. Assuming that users often use the same password and username (the e-mail address) for different services, the attacker will use ""bots"" to try to log on to a large number of sites. When authentication is successful, this allows the attacker to see the information associated with the accounts in question. The CNIL has noted that attackers have been able to read the following information: name, first name, email address and date of birth of customers, but also number and balance of their loyalty card and information related to their orders. Insufficient security measures The Restricted session - the CNIL body responsible for imposing sanctions - considered that the two companies had failed in their obligation to preserve the security of customers' personal data, provided for in Article 32 of the RGPD. Indeed, the companies were slow to put in place measures to effectively combat these repeated attacks. They had decided to focus their response strategy on developing a tool to detect and block attacks launched from robots. However, the development of this tool took a year from the first attacks. In the meantime, several other measures with faster effects could have been considered to prevent new attacks or to mitigate the negative consequences for people, such as : - Limiting the number of requests allowed per IP address on the website, which could have helped to slow down the rate at which attacks were carried out ; - the appearance of a CAPTCHA on the first attempt to authenticate users on their account, which is very difficult for a bot to circumvent. As a result of this lack of diligence, the data of approximately 40,000 website customers was made available to unauthorized third parties between March 2018 and February 2019. Sanctions imposed by the restricted formation As a result, the restricted formation pronounced two separate fines - 150,000 euros against the data controller and 75,000 euros against the processor - in respect of their respective liability. Indeed, it stressed that the data controller must decide on the implementation of measures and give documented instructions to its processor. However, the processor must also seek the most appropriate technical and organizational solutions to ensure the security of personal data and propose them to the data controller. The Restricted session has not decided to make these deliberations public. Nevertheless, it wishes to communicate on these decisions to alert professionals to the need to reinforce their vigilance concerning attacks by credential stuffing, and to develop, in conjunction with their subcontractor, sufficient measures to guarantee the protection of personal data."
