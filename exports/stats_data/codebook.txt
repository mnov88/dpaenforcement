IMPORTANT NOTES FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:
==========================================

1. Legal Data Semantics:
   - NOT_DISCUSSED ≠ NOT_MENTIONED ≠ NOT_APPLICABLE
   - Always filter by status variables before analyzing violations
   - Zero fines may be meaningful (explicit decision of no fine)

2. Multi-select Variables:
   - Binary indicators represent presence/absence of each option
   - Check exclusivity_conflict flags for contradictory responses
   - Use coverage_status to understand response completeness

3. Missing Data:
   - Status variables preserve legal interpretation of missingness
   - Use appropriate imputation methods that respect legal semantics
   - Consider legal reasons for non-response

4. Temporal Analysis:
   - Account for GDPR implementation date (2018-05-25)
   - Consider learning curve effects in early decisions
   - Seasonal patterns may reflect administrative cycles

5. Cross-Country Analysis:
   - Control for different legal traditions and enforcement approaches
   - Consider clustering of standard errors by country/DPA
   - Account for varying interpretation of GDPR requirements
