IMPORTANT NOTES FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:
==========================================

1. Legal Data Semantics:
   - NOT_DISCUSSED ≠ NOT_MENTIONED ≠ NOT_APPLICABLE
   - Always filter by status variables before analyzing violations
   - Zero fines may be meaningful (explicit decision of no fine)

2. Multi-select Variables:
   - Binary indicators represent presence/absence of each option
   - Check exclusivity_conflict flags for contradictory responses
