# GDPR Breach Notification Risk Assessment Playbook

## Executive Summary

This playbook synthesizes causal analysis of 208 breach cases from 1,998 GDPR decisions
to provide evidence-based guidance on breach notification strategy and enforcement risk.

### Key Findings

- **Timing Effect**: Late notification increases enforcement severity by +0.30 index points
- **Country Patterns**: Romania (100% fine rate), Poland+Ex-officio (88%), Norway+Vulnerable (87%)
- **Cluster Profiles**: 6 distinct breach patterns with predictable enforcement outcomes
- **Robustness**: Estimates sensitive to time controls (⚠️ 76% change), require careful interpretation


# GDPR Breach Notification Decision Flowchart

## Step 1: Initial Assessment
- [ ] Is this a personal data breach? (YES → Continue; NO → Document only)
- [ ] Status in decisions: DISCUSSED vs NOT_DISCUSSED vs NOT_APPLICABLE

## Step 2: Risk Factors Analysis
### High-Risk Indicators (FILE_NOW):
- [ ] Special category data (Article 9) involved
- [ ] Vulnerable subjects affected (children, patients, etc.)
- [ ] Late notification (>72 hours) to DPA
- [ ] High-risk countries (Romania=100% fine rate, Poland=88%)
- [ ] Ex-officio DPA investigation likely

### Medium-Risk Indicators (INITIAL_NOTICE):
- [ ] Technical/organizational failures
- [ ] Complaint-driven cases
- [ ] Mixed compliance record
- [ ] Spain/Italy jurisdiction (lower fine rates)

### Low-Risk Indicators (DOCUMENT_ONLY):
- [ ] Timely notification (<72 hours)
- [ ] Subjects properly notified
- [ ] Proactive remedial actions taken
- [ ] No vulnerable subjects

## Step 3: Country-Specific Patterns
Based on cluster analysis:
- **Romania**: 100% fine probability → FILE_NOW
- **Poland + Ex-officio**: 88% fine probability → FILE_NOW
- **Norway + Vulnerable**: 87% fine probability → FILE_NOW
- **Italy + Cyber**: 72% fine probability → INITIAL_NOTICE
- **Spain + Complaints**: 60% fine probability → INITIAL_NOTICE

## Step 4: Robustness Check
- [ ] Are estimates robust to time controls? (⚠️ Current: NO)
- [ ] Country reweighting sensitivity acceptable?
- [ ] Selection bias concerns for turnover data?

## Final Decision Matrix
| Fine Probability | Severity Index | Recommendation |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| ≥90%            | ≥2.0          | FILE_NOW (High confidence) |
| 80-90%          | ≥1.8          | FILE_NOW (Medium confidence) |
| 60-80%          | Any           | INITIAL_NOTICE |
| <60%            | <1.5          | DOCUMENT_ONLY |

## Status Flag Requirements
⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Only use variables where status = "DISCUSSED"
- NOT_DISCUSSED → Insufficient basis for recommendation
- NOT_APPLICABLE → Factor not relevant
- NOT_MENTIONED → Potential data gap


## Sample Risk Assessments

### High-Risk Romania Breach

**Recommendation**: FILE_NOW
**Confidence**: HIGH
**Cluster Match**: Cluster_5: Country Ro, Channel Breach Notification, Breach Type Organizational Failure
**Fine Probability**: 100.0%
**Severity Index**: 2.36

**Risk Factors**:
- Late notification (>72 hours)
- Vulnerable subjects affected
- Subjects not notified when required

**Mitigating Factors**:

### Low-Risk Spain Complaint

**Recommendation**: INITIAL_NOTICE
**Confidence**: MEDIUM
**Cluster Match**: Cluster_2: Channel Complaint, Breach Type Human Error, Country Es
**Fine Probability**: 60.3%
**Severity Index**: 1.49

**Risk Factors**:

**Mitigating Factors**:
- Proactive remedial actions taken
- Timely notification (<72 hours)
- Data subjects notified

### Medium-Risk Italy Cyber

**Recommendation**: INITIAL_NOTICE
**Confidence**: MEDIUM
**Cluster Match**: Cluster_1: Channel Breach Notification, Vulnerable Subjects, Subjects Notified
**Fine Probability**: 77.2%
**Severity Index**: 1.74

**Risk Factors**:
- Vulnerable subjects affected
- Subjects not notified when required

**Mitigating Factors**:
- Timely notification (<72 hours)

## Methodology Notes

- **Status Flag Compliance**: Analysis respects DISCUSSED vs NOT_DISCUSSED distinctions
- **Causal Identification**: AIPW estimators with country/time controls and bootstrap CIs
- **Small Sample Adjustments**: 208 breach cases require power-aware inference
- **ES/IT Reweighting**: 44% concentration requires country reweighting for generalizability

## Usage Instructions

1. **CLI Tool**: Run `python3 breach_risk_cli.py` for interactive assessment
2. **Status Checking**: Verify all inputs are from DISCUSSED decisions only
3. **Robustness**: Consider sensitivity warnings in final recommendations
4. **Legal Review**: This tool provides statistical guidance, not legal advice
